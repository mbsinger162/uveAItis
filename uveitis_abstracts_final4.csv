To begin a process of standardizing the methods for reporting clinical data in the field of uveitis.
DESIGN: Consensus workshop.
METHODS: Members of an international working group were surveyed about diagnostic terminology, inflammation grading schema, and outcome measures, and the results used to develop a series of proposals to better standardize the use of these entities. Small groups employed nominal group techniques to achieve consensus on several of these issues.
RESULTS: The group affirmed that an anatomic classification of uveitis should be used as a framework for subsequent work on diagnostic criteria for specific uveitic syndromes, and that the classification of uveitis entities should be on the basis of the location of the inflammation and not on the presence of structural complications. Issues regarding the use of the terms ""intermediate uveitis,"" ""pars planitis,"" ""panuveitis,"" and descriptors of the onset and course of the uveitis were addressed. The following were adopted: standardized grading schema for anterior chamber cells, anterior chamber flare, and for vitreous haze; standardized methods of recording structural complications of uveitis; standardized definitions of outcomes, including ""inactive"" inflammation, ""improvement'; and ""worsening"" of the inflammation, and ""corticosteroid sparing,"" and standardized guidelines for reporting visual acuity outcomes.
CONCLUSIONS: A process of standardizing the approach to reporting clinical data in uveitis research has begun, and several terms have been standardized.",1185,2005-Sep-1

T-helper type 17 cells (T(H)17) are implicated in rodent models of immune-mediated diseases. Here we report their involvement in human uveitis and scleritis, and validate our findings in experimental autoimmune uveoretinitis (EAU), a model of uveitis. T(H)17 cells were present in human peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC), and were expanded by interleukin (IL)-2 and inhibited by interferon (IFN)-gamma. Their numbers increased during active uveitis and scleritis and decreased following treatment. IL-17 was elevated in EAU and upregulated tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-alpha in retinal cells, suggesting a mechanism by which T(H)17 may contribute to ocular pathology. Furthermore, IL-27 was constitutively expressed in retinal ganglion and photoreceptor cells, was upregulated by IFN-gamma and inhibited proliferation of T(H)17. These findings suggest that T(H)1 cells may mitigate uveitis by antagonizing the T(H)17 phenotype through the IFN-gamma-mediated induction of IL-27 in target tissue. The finding that IL-2 promotes T(H)17 expansion provides explanations for the efficacy of IL-2R antibody therapy in uveitis, and suggests that antagonism of T(H)17 by IFN-gamma and/or IL-27 could be used for the treatment of chronic inflammation.",363,2007-Jun-1

Interleukin-17A (IL-17A) is elaborated by the T helper 17 (T(H)17) subset of T(H) cells and exhibits potent proinflammatory properties in animal models of autoimmunity, including collagen-induced arthritis, experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis, and experimental autoimmune uveitis. To determine whether IL-17A mediates human inflammatory diseases, we investigated the efficacy and safety of AIN457, a human antibody to IL-17A, in patients with psoriasis, rheumatoid arthritis, and chronic noninfectious uveitis. Patients with chronic plaque-type psoriasis (n = 36), rheumatoid arthritis (n = 52), or chronic noninfectious uveitis (n = 16) were enrolled in clinical trials to evaluate the effects of neutralizing IL-17A by AIN457 at doses of 3 to 10 mg/kg, given intravenously. We evaluated efficacy by measuring the psoriasis area and severity index (PASI), the American College of Rheumatology 20% response (ACR20) for rheumatoid arthritis, or the number of responders for uveitis, as defined by either vision improvement or reduction in ocular inflammation or corticosteroid dose. AIN457 treatment induced clinically relevant responses of variable magnitude in patients suffering from each of these diverse immune-mediated diseases. Variable response rates may be due to heterogeneity in small patient populations, differential pathogenic roles of IL-17A in these diseases, and the different involvement or activation of IL-17A-producing cells. The rates of adverse events, including infections, were similar in the AIN457 and placebo groups. These results support a role for IL-17A in the pathophysiology of diverse inflammatory diseases including psoriasis, rheumatoid arthritis, and noninfectious uveitis.",316,2010-Oct-06

Autoimmune and inflammatory uveitis are a group of potentially blinding intraocular inflammatory diseases that arise without a known infectious trigger and are often associated with immunological responses to unique retinal proteins. In the United States, about 10% of the cases of severe visual handicap are attributed to this group of disorders. As I discuss here, experimental models of ocular autoimmunity targeting retinal proteins have brought about a better understanding of the basic immunological mechanisms involved in the pathogenesis of uveitis and are serving as templates for the development of novel therapies.",212,2010-Sep-1

Inflammatory diseases of the eye were known to the ancients, but only recently have the underlying mechanisms to this problem become better defined. During the middle portion of this century, most cases of uveitis thought to be caused by infectious agents, such as those responsible for syphilis and tuberculosis. Since then, it has become clear that endogenous mechanisms of immunomodulation play an important role in these disorders, which along with environmental and genetic factors make up an important triad. Animals studies have indicated the pivotal role of the T-cell in many of these disorders. The development of T-cell lines has helped to further delineate cell to cell interactions that occur during an ocular inflammatory event. The presence in the eye of uveitogenic antigens raises the strong possibility of autoimmune driven processes as well, similar to what is seen in the animal models. The better understanding of ocular inflammatory mechanisms has led to improved therapeutic strategies, including Sandimmune, and more recently Cyclosporine G, a related compound that may be less nephrotoxic. Newer therapeutic strategies will focus on even more novel modes of immunomodulation, probably without the use of medications.",191,1990-Oct-1

Standardization of observations is recognized as fundamental to clinical research. The methodology for the evaluation of anterior segment inflammatory disease has become well accepted, while the ocular inflammatory standardization of the posterior segment has not been so well described or accepted. A system for the evaluation of vitreal inflammatory activity in patients with intermediate and posterior uveitis is presented. A series of photographs representing various degrees of fundus vitreal haze is depicted. The observer examines the eye with an indirect ophthalmoscope, then chooses the photograph which most closely simulates what is being seen. This technique is rapid and its reproducibility is helpful in standardizing clinical observations.",178,1985-Apr-1

Uveitis is a common, sight-threatening inflammatory ocular disease and includes multiple heterogeneous clinical entities. The prevalence of various types of uveitis depends upon multiple factors, such as age, sex, race, geographic distribution, environmental influence, genetics, and social habits. Epidemiologic research of uveitis is necessary to understand the etiology and immunopathogenesis of this group of diseases. The present study attempts to concentrate on the most recent information on the epidemiology of uveitis and compare it with previous knowledge.
METHODS: An extensive literature search was performed in the Medline database (PubMed) and included surveys completed until 2015. Articles that reported prevalence and incidence were studied. References cited in the articles were also studied.
RESULTS: The incidence and prevalence of uveitis differs based on age, anatomic location of the inflammatory process (anterior, intermediate, posterior uveitis, panuveitis), gender, histopathology (granulomatous, non-granulomatous), type of inflammatory process (acute, chronic, recurrent), and etiology (infectious, non-infectious). Prevalence differs by geographic location. Idiopathic anterior uveitis is the most common form of uveitis in the community. Infectious causes are common (30-60%) in the developing countries. Herpes and toxoplasmosis are the leading infectious causes of uveitis. Non-infectious uveitic conditions are generally more common in the developed world. An increase in the prevalence of infectious etiologies, including tuberculosis and syphilis, has been seen in developed countries. Introduction of new treatment options has also changed patterns of disease.
CONCLUSIONS: Introduction of new uveitis entities, changes in the incidence of already known disease and increased availability of diagnostic testing have all altered the epidemiology of uveitis in recent years. Knowledge of regional patterns of disease is essential. A more detailed classification of uveitis with the establishment of uniform diagnostic criteria and prospective population based studies would certainly benefit epidemiologic research and clinical practice.",162,2018-1-1

Experimental autoimmune uveoretinitis (EAU) is an organ-specific, T lymphocyte-mediated autoimmune disease, which serves as a model for several human ocular inflammations of an apparently autoimmune nature. EAU pathology in some rodents and in monkeys can readily be induced by immunization with several different retinal proteins; however, advancing research into the cellular mechanisms of this disease has raised the need for an EAU model in an immunologically and genetically well defined species. We report here the induction of EAU in the mouse, which has hitherto been considered a species refractory to EAU, with two retinal Ag, the retinal soluble Ag and the interphotoreceptor retinoid-binding protein. Although all the mouse strains tested exhibited lymphocyte responses and antibody titers to both retinal Ag, EAU was inducible in only some of the strains, and the uveitogenic responses to retinal soluble Ag and interphotoreceptor retinoid-binding protein appeared to be mutually exclusive. The EAU model in mice was found to differ in several respects from the EAU model in other rodent species. Induction of the disease was achieved with a relatively high dose of Ag and an intensified immunization protocol, and the onset of disease was later, the duration was longer, and the course was less acute. Anterior segment involvement was slight or nonexistent, and damage to the retina and uvea was of a focal rather than of a diffuse nature. Murine EAU appeared to approximate some types of human uveitis more closely than the EAU models described in other rodent species with respect to its pathologic manifestations as well as its more chronic course. The relatively longer duration of the active stage of disease in murine EAU should facilitate therapeutic intervention in established disease, which was not feasible in the more acute models of EAU. The extensive knowledge of the immunologic parameters of the mouse and the availability of genetically defined strains should be of great value in the study of cellular mechanisms and immunogenetics of ocular autoimmune disease.",154,1988-Mar-01

The expression of self-antigen in the thymus is believed to be responsible for the deletion of autoreactive T lymphocytes, a critical process in the maintenance of unresponsiveness to self. The Autoimmune regulator (Aire) gene, which is defective in the disorder autoimmune polyglandular syndrome type 1, has been shown to promote the thymic expression of self-antigens. A clear link, however, between specific thymic self-antigens and a single autoimmune phenotype in this model has been lacking. We show that autoimmune eye disease in aire-deficient mice develops as a result of loss of thymic expression of a single eye antigen, interphotoreceptor retinoid-binding protein (IRBP). In addition, lack of IRBP expression solely in the thymus, even in the presence of aire expression, is sufficient to trigger spontaneous eye-specific autoimmunity. These results suggest that failure of thymic expression of selective single self-antigens can be sufficient to cause organ-specific autoimmune disease, even in otherwise self-tolerant individuals.",147,2006-Nov-27

To evaluate the prevalence of the most common serious adverse events associated with intravitreous (IVT) injection.
METHODS: A systematic search of the literature via PubMed from 1966 to March 1, 2004, was conducted to identify studies evaluating the safety of IVT injection. Data submitted in New Drug Applications to the U.S. Food and Drug Administration for drugs administered into the vitreous were included where available. Serious adverse events reported in each study were recorded, and risk per eye and risk per injection were calculated for the following serious adverse events: endophthalmitis, retinal detachment, iritis/uveitis, intraocular hemorrhage, ocular hypertension, cataract, and hypotony. Rare complications also were noted.
RESULTS: Data from 14,866 IVT injections in 4,382 eyes were analyzed. There were 38 cases of endophthalmitis (including those reported as pseudoendophthalmitis) for a prevalence of 0.3% per injection and 0.9% per eye. Excluding cases reported specifically as pseudoendophthalmitis, the prevalence of endophthalmitis was 0.2% per injection and 0.5% per eye. Retinal detachment, iritis/uveitis, ocular hypertension, cataract, intraocular hemorrhage, and hypotony were generally associated with IVT injection of specific compounds and were infrequently attributed by the investigators to the injection procedure itself. Retinal vascular occlusions were described rarely in patients after IVT injection, and it was unclear in most cases whether these represented true injection-related complications or chance associations.
CONCLUSION: The risk of serious adverse events reported after IVT injection is low. Nevertheless, careful attention to injection technique and appropriate postinjection monitoring are essential because uncommon injection-related complications may be associated with permanent vision loss.",135,2004-Oct-1

Non-infectious uveitis is a potentially sight-threatening ocular disorder caused by chronic inflammation and its complications. Therapeutic success is limited by systemic adverse effects associated with long-term corticosteroid and immunomodulator use if topical medication is not sufficient to control the inflammation. We aimed to assess the efficacy and safety of adalimumab in patients with inactive, non-infectious uveitis controlled by systemic corticosteroids.
METHODS: We did this multicentre, double-masked, randomised, placebo-controlled phase 3 trial at 62 study sites in 21 countries in the USA, Canada, Europe, Israel, Australia, and Latin America. Patients (aged ≥18 years) with inactive, non-infectious intermediate, posterior, or panuveitic uveitis controlled by 10-35 mg/day of prednisone were randomly assigned (1:1), via an interactive voice and web response system with a block size of four, to receive either subcutaneous adalimumab (loading dose 80 mg; biweekly dose 40 mg) or placebo, with a mandatory prednisone taper from week 2. Randomisation was stratified by baseline immunosuppressant treatment. Sponsor personnel with direct oversight of the conduct and management of the study, investigators, study site personnel, and patients were masked to treatment allocation. The primary efficacy endpoint was time to treatment failure, a multicomponent endpoint encompassing new active inflammatory chorioretinal or inflammatory retinal vascular lesions, anterior chamber cell grade, vitreous haze grade, and visual acuity. Analysis was done in the intention-to-treat population. This trial is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov number NCT01124838.
FINDINGS: Between Aug 10, 2010, and May 14, 2015, we randomly assigned 229 patients to receive placebo (n=114) or adalimumab (n=115); 226 patients comprised the intention-to-treat population. Median follow-up time was 155 days (IQR 77-357) in the placebo group and 245 days (119-564) in the adalimumab group. Treatment failure occurred in 61 (55%) of 111 patients in the placebo group compared with 45 (39%) of 115 patients in the adalimumab group. Time to treatment failure was significantly improved in the adalimumab group compared with the placebo group (median not estimated [>18 months] vs 8·3 months; hazard ratio 0·57, 95% CI 0·39-0·84; p=0·004). The 40th percentile for time to treatment failure was 4·8 months in the placebo group and 10·2 months in the adalimumab group. No patients in either group had opportunistic infections (excluding oral candidiasis and tuberculosis). No malignancies were reported in the placebo group whereas one (1%) patient in the adalimumab group reported non-serious squamous cell carcinoma. The most common adverse events were arthralgia (12 [11%] patients in the placebo group and 27 [23%] patients in the adalimumab group), nasopharyngitis (16 [17%] and eight [16%] patients, respectively), and headache (17 [15%] patients in each group).
INTERPRETATION: Adalimumab significantly lowered the risk of uveitic flare or loss of visual acuity upon corticosteroid withdrawal in patients with inactive, non-infectious intermediate, posterior, or panuveitic uveitis controlled by systemic corticosteroids. No new safety signals were observed and the rate of adverse events was similar between groups. These findings suggest that adalimumab is well tolerated and could be an effective treatment option in this patient population. An open-label extension study (NCT01148225) is ongoing to provide long-term safety data for adalimumab in patients with non-infectious uveitis.

To report criteria for the diagnosis of intraocular sarcoidosis, taking into account suggestive clinical signs and appropriate laboratory investigations and biopsy results.
DESIGN: Concensus workshop of an international committee on nomenclature.
METHODS: An international group of uveitis specialists from Asia, Africa, Europe, and America met in a concensus conference in Shinagawa, Tokyo on October 28-29, 2006. Based on questionnaires that had been sent out prior to the conference, the participants discussed potential intraocular clinical signs eligible for a diagnosis of ocular sarcoidosis. A refined definition of clinical signs, which received two-thirds majority of votes, was included in the list of signs consistent with ocular sarcoidosis. Laboratory investigations were similarly discussed and those tests reaching a two-thirds majority were retained for the diagnosis of ocular sarcoidosis. Finally diagnostic criteria were proposed based on ocular signs, laboratory investigations, and biopsy results.
RESULTS: The concensus conference identified seven signs in the diagnosis of intraocular sarcoidosis: (1) mutton-fat keratic precipitates (KPs)/small granulomatous KPs and/or iris nodules (Koeppe/Busacca), (2) trabecular meshwork (TM) nodules and/or tent-shaped peripheral anterior synechiae (PAS), (3) vitreous opacities displaying snowballs/strings of pearls, (4) multiple chorioretinal peripheral lesions (active and/or atrophic), (5) nodular and/or segmental peri-phlebitis (+/- candlewax drippings) and/or retinal macroaneurism in an inflamed eye, 6) optic disc nodule(s)/granuloma(s) and/or solitary choroidal nodule, and (7) bilaterality. The laboratory investigations or investigational procedures that were judged to provide value in the diagnosis of ocular sarcoidosis in patients having the above intraocular signs included (1) negative tuberculin skin test in a BCG-vaccinated patient or in a patient having had a positive tuberculin skin test previously, (2) elevated serum angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) levels and/or elevated serum lysozyme, (3) chest x-ray revealing bilateral hilar lymphadenopathy (BHL), (4) abnormal liver enzyme tests, and (5) chest CT scan in patients with a negative chest x-ray result. Four levels of certainty for the diagnosis of ocular sarcoidosis (diagnostic criteria) were recommended in patients in whom other possible causes of uveitis had been excluded: (1) biopsy-supported diagnosis with a compatible uveitis was labeled as definite ocular sarcoidosis; (2) if biopsy was not done but chest x-ray was positive showing BHL associated with a compatible uveitis, the condition was labeled as presumed ocular sarcoidosis; (3) if biopsy was not done and the chest x-ray did not show BHL but there were 3 of the above intraocular signs and 2 positive laboratory tests, the condition was labeled as probable ocular sarcoidosis; and (4) if lung biopsy was done and the result was negative but at least 4 of the above signs and 2 positive laboratory investigations were present, the condition was labeled as possible ocular sarcoidosis.
CONCLUSION: Various clinical signs, laboratory investigations, and biopsy results provided four diagnostic categories of sarcoid uveitis. The categorization allows prospective multinational clinical trials to be conducted using a standardized nomenclature, which serves as a platform for comparison of visual outcomes with various therapeutic modalities.",129,2009-1-1

We aimed to describe the demographic and clinical features, ocular manifestations, complications, visual prognosis, and treatment in a large population of Turkish patients with Behçet uveitis. We also aimed to compare visual prognosis between male and female sex and between patients who presented before and after 1990.
DESIGN: Observational case series.
METHODS: A retrospective study of 880 consecutive patients (1,567 eyes) with Behçet uveitis seen at the Uveitis Service, Department of Ophthalmology, Istanbul Faculty of Medicine, Istanbul University, from 1980 to 1998. All patients met the classification criteria of the International Study Group for Behçet's Disease. Information on the patient's sex, age at onset of uveitis, ocular features, ocular complications, visual acuity, and systemic treatment was collected.
RESULTS: Five hundred ninety-nine patients (68%) were male and 281 (32%) were female. The mean age at onset of uveitis was 28.5 years in male and 30 years in female patients. Ocular involvement was bilateral in 78.1% and unilateral in 21.9% of the patients. Panuveitis was the most common form in both sexes. Fundus lesions as well as sight-threatening complications were more common in males. At the beginning of the follow-up, potential visual acuity was 0.1 or less in 30.9% of eyes in males and 24.2% of eyes in females. Kaplan-Meier survival analysis estimated the risks of losing useful vision (>0.1) at 5 and 10 years for males and females as 21% vs 10% and 30% vs 17%, respectively. Male patients who presented in the 1990s had a significantly lower risk of losing vision compared with male patients who presented in the 1980s.
CONCLUSION: Behçet uveitis starts frequently around the end of the third decade and has a male predominance. The disease is more severe and the risk of losing useful vision is higher in males than in females. However, this risk has been significantly reduced in the 1990s.",127,2004-Sep-1

To provide recommendations for the use of anti-tumor necrosis factor α (TNF-α) biologic agents in patients with ocular inflammatory disorders.
CLINICAL RELEVANCE: Ocular inflammatory diseases remain a leading cause of vision loss worldwide. Anti-TNF-α agents are used widely in treatment of rheumatologic diseases. A committee of the American Uveitis Society performed a systematic review of literature to generate guidelines for use of these agents in ocular inflammatory conditions.
METHODS: A systematic review of published studies was performed. Recommendations were generated using the Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development, and Evaluation group criteria.
RESULTS: Numerous studies including controlled clinical trials have demonstrated that anti-TNF-α biologic agents (in particular infliximab and adalimumab) are effective in the treatment of severe ocular inflammatory disease. Based on these studies, the expert panel makes the following recommendations.
CONCLUSIONS: Infliximab and adalimumab can be considered as first-line immunomodulatory agents for the treatment of ocular manifestations of Behçet's disease. Infliximab and adalimumab can be considered as second-line immunomodulatory agents for the treatment of uveitis associated with juvenile arthritis. Infliximab and adalimumab can be considered as potential second-line immunomodulatory agents for the treatment of severe ocular inflammatory conditions including posterior uveitis, panuveitis, severe uveitis associated with seronegative spondyloarthropathy, and scleritis in patients requiring immunomodulation in patients who have failed or who are not candidates for antimetabolite or calcineurin inhibitor immunomodulation. Infliximab and adalimumab can be considered in these patients in preference to etanercept, which seems to be associated with lower rates of treatment success.",125,2014-Mar-1

Most uveitis case series have come from tertiary care centers, and the relative frequencies of disorders they report may reflect referral bias. We sought information about the types of uveitis encountered in the general practice of ophthalmology.
METHODS: We prospectively examined 213 consecutive cases of general uveitis, defined as intraocular inflammation other than cytomegalovirus retinopathy, seen by a group of community-based comprehensive ophthalmologists. This group of cases was compared with 213 consecutive cases of general uveitis examined by a uveitis specialist at a university referral center in the same community. All cases were categorized by anatomic site of inflammation and disease course, and, if possible, they were assigned a specific diagnosis. Cases of cytomegalovirus retinopathy and masquerade syndrome seen during the same intervals were recorded separately.
RESULTS: The distribution of general uveitis cases by anatomic site of disease was significantly different between the community-based practices (anterior, 90.6%; intermediate, 1.4%; posterior 4.7%; panuveitis, 1.4%) and the university referral practice (anterior, 60.6%; intermediate, 12.2%; posterior, 14.6%; panuveitis, 9.4%; P < .00005). A cause or clinical syndrome could be assigned to 47.4% of cases in the community-based practices, and to 57.8% of cases in the university referral practice (P = .03). HLA-B27-associated anterior uveitis, cytomegalovirus retinopathy, and toxoplasmic retinochoroiditis were among the five most common forms of uveitis in both practice settings.
CONCLUSION: The relative frequencies with which various forms of uveitis are seen in a tertiary referral center do not necessarily reflect the experience of ophthalmologists from the community in which the center is located. Anterior uveitis and disorders of sudden onset constitute a greater proportion of cases seen by community-based comprehensive ophthalmologists.",114,1996-Jan-1

The term uveitis encompasses a very diverse group of inflammatory ocular diseases that cause a significant burden of legal and economic blindness. Indeed, the socioeconomic impact of uveitis is at least as significant as that of diabetic retinopathy and, in the majority of cases, those affected are young individuals of working age. Significant progress has been made in our understanding of the mechanisms underlying the inflammatory process through the use of animal models, but correlation with human disease has proved elusive and many scientific approaches which appear highly effective in animal models prove to be less effective in patients. Nevertheless, effective, targeted treatments are needed in uveitis as current treatment is based on corticosteroids and immunosuppressive drugs whose usefulness is limited by their many side-effects. The aims of this review are to summarize the state of clinical research in uveitis, to identify gaps in our knowledge, and to propose new opportunities and methodologies for future developments in all aspects of uveitis research, including epidemiology, economic impact analysis, diagnosis, therapeutics, and clinical study design. Optimal patient management and efficient drug development depend on validated structured tools, such as those that have helped to drive a rapid acceleration in the means and methods available to assess and treat patients with rheumatoid arthritis and cancer. Uveitis care should witness a similar boom as the issues discussed are resolved.",113,2011-Nov-1

To compare the relative effectiveness of systemic corticosteroids plus immunosuppression when indicated (systemic therapy) versus fluocinolone acetonide implant (implant therapy) for noninfectious intermediate, posterior, or panuveitis (uveitis).
DESIGN: Randomized controlled parallel superiority trial.
PARTICIPANTS: Patients with active or recently active uveitis.
METHODS: Participants were randomized (allocation ratio 1:1) to systemic or implant therapy at 23 centers (3 countries). Implant-assigned participants with bilateral uveitis were assigned to have each eye that warranted study treatment implanted. Treatment-outcome associations were analyzed by assigned treatment for all eyes with uveitis.
MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Masked examiners measured the primary outcome: change in best-corrected visual acuity from baseline. Secondary outcomes included patient-reported quality of life, ophthalmologist-graded uveitis activity, and local and systemic complications of uveitis or therapy. Reading Center graders and glaucoma specialists assessing ocular complications were masked. Participants, ophthalmologists, and coordinators were unmasked.
RESULTS: On evaluation of changes from baseline to 24 months among 255 patients randomized to implant and systemic therapy (479 eyes with uveitis), the implant and systemic therapy groups had an improvement in visual acuity of +6.0 and +3.2 letters (P = 0.16, 95% confidence interval on difference in improvement between groups, -1.2 to +6.7 letters, positive values favoring implant), an improvement in vision-related quality of life of +11.4 and +6.8 units (P = 0.043), a change in EuroQol-EQ5D health utility of +0.02 and -0.02 (P = 0.060), and residual active uveitis in 12% and 29% (P=0.001), respectively. Over the 24 month period, implant-assigned eyes had a higher risk of cataract surgery (80%, hazard ratio [HR] = 3.3, P < 0.0001), treatment for elevated intraocular pressure (61%, HR=4.2, P < 0.0001), and glaucoma (17%, HR=4.2, P = 0.0008). Patients assigned to systemic therapy had more prescription-requiring infections than patients assigned to implant therapy (0.60 vs 0.36/person-year, P=0.034), without notable long-term consequences; systemic adverse outcomes otherwise were unusual in both groups, with minimal differences between groups.
CONCLUSIONS: In each treatment group, mean visual acuity improved over 24 months, with neither approach superior to a degree detectable with the study's power. Therefore, the specific advantages and disadvantages identified should dictate selection between the alternative treatments in consideration of individual patients' particular circumstances. Systemic therapy with aggressive use of corticosteroid-sparing immunosuppression was well tolerated, suggesting that this approach is reasonably safe for local and systemic inflammatory disorders.

To determine the efficacy and safety of different doses of secukinumab, a fully human monoclonal antibody for targeted interleukin-17A blockade, in patients with noninfectious uveitis.
DESIGN: Three multicenter, randomized, double-masked, placebo-controlled, dose-ranging phase III studies: SHIELD, INSURE, and ENDURE.
PARTICIPANTS: A total of 118 patients with Behçet's uveitis (SHIELD study); 31 patients with active, noninfectious, non-Behçet's uveitis (INSURE study); and 125 patients with quiescent, noninfectious, non-Behçet's uveitis (ENDURE study) were enrolled.
METHODS: After an initial subcutaneous (s.c.) loading phase in each treatment arm, patients received s.c. maintenance therapy with secukinumab 300 mg every 2 weeks (q2w), secukinumab 300 mg monthly (q4w), or placebo in the SHIELD study; secukinumab 300 mg q2w, secukinumab 300 mg q4w, secukinumab 150 mg q4w, or placebo in the INSURE study; or secukinumab 300 mg q2w, secukinumab 300 mg q4w, secukinumab 150 mg q4w, or placebo in the ENDURE study.
MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Reduction of uveitis recurrence or vitreous haze score during withdrawal of concomitant immunosuppressive medication (ISM). Other end points included best-corrected visual acuity, ISM use (expressed as a standardized ISM score), and safety outcomes.
RESULTS: After completion or early termination of each trial, there were no statistically significant differences in uveitis recurrence between the secukinumab treatment groups and placebo groups in any study. Secukinumab was associated with a significant reduction in mean total post-baseline ISM score (P = 0.019; 300 mg q4w vs. placebo) in the SHIELD study. Likewise, secukinumab was associated with a greater median reduction in ISM score versus placebo in the INSURE study, although no statistical analysis of the difference was conducted because of the small sample size. Overall, there was no loss in visual acuity reported in any treatment group during follow-up in all 3 studies. According to descriptive safety statistics, the frequencies of ocular and nonocular adverse events seemed to be slightly higher among secukinumab groups versus placebo across the 3 studies.
CONCLUSIONS: The primary efficacy end points of the 3 studies were not met. The secondary efficacy data from these studies suggest a beneficial effect of secukinumab in reducing the use of concomitant ISM.",104,2013-Apr-1

Acute anterior uveitis is the most common form of uveitis. HLA-B27-associated acute anterior uveitis is a distinct clinical entity that has wide-ranging medical significance due to its ocular, systemic, immunologic, and genetic features. The association between HLA-B27 and the spectrum of HLA-B27-associated inflammatory diseases remains one of the strongest HLA-disease associations known to date. This review examines acute anterior uveitis with particular focus on HLA-B27-associated acute anterior uveitis, including the epidemiology, immunopathology, association with HLA-B27 and its subtypes, clinical features, complications, prognosis, and potential new therapies such as anti-TNFalpha therapy and oral HLA-B27-peptide tolerance. There have been substantial recent advances in both clinical and basic scientific research in this field, including studies of the various animal models of acute anterior uveitis and the HLA-B27 transgenic animals, and these are summarized in this review. To the ophthalmologist, HLA-B27-associated acute anterior uveitis is an important clinical entity that is common, afflicts relatively young patients in their most productive years, and is associated with significant ocular morbidity due to its typically recurrent attacks of inflammation and its potentially vision-threatening ocular complications. Furthermore, to the ophthalmologist and the internist, HLA-B27-associated acute anterior uveitis is also of systemic importance due to its significant association with extraocular inflammatory diseases.",102,2005-1-1

The world's medical literature on tubulointerstitial nephritis and uveitis (TINU) syndrome was reviewed, and data on 133 patients with TINU syndrome were identified. The median age of onset was 15 years (range 9-74 years) with a 3:1 female-to-male predominance. Common laboratory abnormalities included elevated Westergren erythrocyte sedimentation rates and elevated urinary beta-2-microglobulin levels. Ocular symptoms preceded systemic symptoms in 21% of cases, and followed systemic symptoms by up to 14 months in 65% of cases. Uveitis involved only the anterior segment in 80% of cases. Uveitis was bilateral at presentation in 77% of cases. Patients were treated with systemic corticosteroids in 80% of cases and with immunosuppressive drugs in 9% of cases. Uveitis recurred or followed a chronic course in 56% of patients and persisted for several years in some cases. Ocular complications (including posterior synechiae, cataracts, and elevated intraocular pressure) were reported in 21% of cases. The visual prognosis appears to be good. Persistent renal dysfunction was reported in 11% of cases, including five patients who required renal dialysis. TINU syndrome is a distinct clinical entity that may be under-recognized and may account for some cases of unexplained chronic or recurrent uveitis. It is important for ophthalmologists, nephrologists, and primary care providers to be familiar with this disorder to ensure early diagnosis and appropriate treatment.",98,2001-1-1

The model of experimental autoimmune uveitis (EAU) in mice and in rats is described. EAU targets immunologically privileged retinal antigens and serves as a model of autoimmune uveitis in humans as well as a model for autoimmunity in a more general sense. EAU is a well-characterized, robust, and reproducible model that is easily followed and quantitated. It is inducible with synthetic peptides derived from retinal autoantigens in commonly available strains of rats and mice. The ability to induce EAU in various gene-manipulated, including HLA-transgenic, mouse strains makes the EAU model suitable for the study of basic mechanisms as well as in clinically relevant interventions.",95,2012-1-1

Uveitis is responsible for a significant proportion of legal blindness in the United States. Currently, there are few population-based reports characterizing the epidemiology of uveitis.
OBJECTIVE: To ascertain the incidence and prevalence of uveitis in a Hawaiian population and compare these estimates with those from prior population-based studies.
DESIGN: Retrospective, population-based cohort study conducted from January 1, 2006, to December 31, 2007.
SETTING: Kaiser Permanente Hawaii, a multispecialty managed care organization serving approximately 15% of the general Hawaiian population with locations throughout the Hawaiian islands.
PARTICIPANTS: All patients enrolled in the Kaiser Permanente Hawaii health plan during the study (N = 217,061).
MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: Clinical diagnosis of uveitis, either incident or prevalent, during the study determined by an initial search of the electronic medical record database of Kaiser Permanente Hawaii for uveitis-associated International Classification of Diseases, Ninth Revision diagnosis codes and subsequently confirmed through individual record review by a uveitis specialist.
RESULTS: Of 217,061 eligible patients, 872 were identified using International Classification of Diseases, Ninth Revision codes and 224 cases of uveitis were confirmed. The overall uveitis incidence rate was 24.9 cases per 100,000 person-years. The annual prevalence rates for 2006 and 2007 were 57.5 and 58.0 per 100,000 persons, respectively. No difference in incidence rate was found by sex (P = .63), but female patients had a higher prevalence (P = .008). Incidence and prevalence increased with older age (P < .001 for incidence and prevalence). Pacific Islanders had a lower prevalence rate than non-Pacific Islanders (2006: P = .09, 2007: P = .04), while white individuals had a higher prevalence rate than nonwhite individuals (2006: P = .07, 2007: P = .01).
CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: The incidence and prevalence of uveitis in this population were much lower than in the Northern California Epidemiology of Uveitis Study, but similar to the Northwest Veterans Affairs Study. The results of this study highlight incidence and prevalence estimates in a new population and provide novel comparisons by race. These differences by race raise questions regarding the effects of genetic and environmental influences on the pathophysiology of uveitis.",95,2013-Nov-1

Uveitis (intraocular inflammation) is a potentially blinding group of, probably autoimmune, conditions predominantly occurring in the working age group. Although the aetiology is unknown in most cases, many patients have an associated underlying systemic disease. Central vision loss, in the form of cystoid macular oedema, is the commonest type of visual impairment. Although historical incidence and prevalence data exists, little is known about the degree of vision loss experienced, and the social and financial consequences of having temporary or permanent visual impairment in this age group. The literature is also full of uncontrolled studies and case reports of different modalities of drug therapy for uveitis. This article attempts to raise the awareness of uveitis as an important sight-threatening group of conditions by highlighting the paucity of evidence-based data on epidemiological, quality of life, socioeconomic, and therapeutic aspects.",93,2004-1-1

To study the patterns of uveitis in various geographic regions.
METHODS: A systematic literature review was performed using the MEDLINE database, from 1966 to present. Studies that satisfied our described selection criteria were analyzed to provide a global perspective on uveitis.
RESULTS: Twenty-two studies, which were the best available representatives of Australia, North and South America, Europe, Asia, and Africa, were included in the final analysis. The distribution of uveitis cases according to the anatomical site of inflammation in the various regions, and the causes and clinical disease associations of anterior, intermediate, posterior, and pan-uveitis were studied for each of the regions and a comparative analysis was performed.
CONCLUSIONS: There are similarities and distinct differences in the patterns of uveitis in the various geographic regions. Such patterns of uveitis are influenced by combinations of geographical, environmental, and genetic factors.",92,2002-Dec-1

To address the clinical pattern and characteristics of uveitis in a tertiary center for uveitis in China and compare the similarity and difference in the distribution of uveitis entities between China and other countries.
METHODS: A retrospective study was performed on the patients with uveitis referred to the Zhongshan Ophthalmic Center from January 1996 to December 2003. The clinical data including category, etiology, gender, and the age of the patients at uveitis presentation were analyzed and compared with studies published previously from other countries.
RESULTS: There were 902 male and 850 female patients in our series. The mean age of these patients at uveitis presentation was 33.8 +/- 16.5 years. Anterior uveitis (800, 45.6%) was the most common anatomical entity, followed by panuveitis (727, 41.5%), posterior uveitis (119, 6.8%), and intermediate uveitis (106, 6.1%). Further classification with the etiology criteria revealed 16 entities in anterior uveitis, with idiopathic anterior uveitis being the most common entity (473, 27.0%). Twelve entities were identified in panuveitis, of which Behçet disease (289, 16.5%) and Vogt-Koyanagi-Harada (VKH) syndrome (278, 15.9%) were the predominant ones. No specific entity was recognized in the intermediate uveitis group. Although a number of specific entities were identified in posterior uveitis, toxoplasmosis was noted in only two patients in this group.
CONCLUSIONS: Idiopathic anterior uveitis, Behçet disease, and VKH syndrome are the most common entities of uveitis in China. Ocular toxoplasmosis, ocular histoplasmosis, and birdshot retinochoroidopathy are less common or absent in China.",91,2005-Nov-1

Ocular infections remain a major cause of blindness and morbidity worldwide. While prognosis is dependent on the timing and accuracy of diagnosis, the etiology remains elusive in ~50 % of presumed infectious uveitis cases. The objective of this study is to determine if unbiased metagenomic deep sequencing (MDS) can accurately detect pathogens in intraocular fluid samples of patients with uveitis.
METHODS: This is a proof-of-concept study, in which intraocular fluid samples were obtained from five subjects with known diagnoses, and one subject with bilateral chronic uveitis without a known etiology. Samples were subjected to MDS, and results were compared with those from conventional diagnostic tests. Pathogens were identified using a rapid computational pipeline to analyze the non-host sequences obtained from MDS.
RESULTS: Unbiased MDS of intraocular fluid produced results concordant with known diagnoses in subjects with (n = 4) and without (n = 1) uveitis. Samples positive for Cryptococcus neoformans, Toxoplasma gondii, and herpes simplex virus 1 as tested by a Clinical Laboratory Improvement Amendments-certified laboratory were correctly identified with MDS. Rubella virus was identified in one case of chronic bilateral idiopathic uveitis. The subject's strain was most closely related to a German rubella virus strain isolated in 1992, one year before he developed a fever and rash while living in Germany. The pattern and the number of viral identified mutations present in the patient's strain were consistent with long-term viral replication in the eye.
CONCLUSIONS: MDS can identify fungi, parasites, and DNA and RNA viruses in minute volumes of intraocular fluid samples. The identification of chronic intraocular rubella virus infection highlights the eye's role as a long-term pathogen reservoir, which has implications for virus eradication and emerging global epidemics.",90,2016-Aug-25

Cytotoxic agents have long been used in Behçet's syndrome, especially for eye involvement, but their effectiveness has been uncertain. We conducted a two-year randomized, placebo-controlled, double-blind trial of azathioprine (2.5 mg per kilogram of body weight per day) in Turkish men with Behçet's syndrome without eye disease (group 1; n = 25) or with eye disease (group 2; n = 48). Corticosteroid treatment remained available to all the patients. All six patients withdrawn from the study because of severe eye disease were receiving placebo (P less than 0.001). Azathioprine was superior to placebo in the prevention of new eye disease in group 1 (1 vs. 8 patients; P less than 0.01) and in group 2 among the 14 patients who at entry had disease in only one eye (P less than 0.001). There were fewer episodes of hypopyon uveitis (1 vs. 15; P less than 0.001) among the group 2 patients who took azathioprine. The patients taking azathioprine also had less frequent oral ulcers, genital ulcers, and arthritis. There were no serious side effects attributable to azathioprine. We conclude that azathioprine is effective in controlling the progression of Behçet's syndrome, especially its most serious manifestation, eye disease.",89,1990-Feb-01

To describe the disease characteristics and visual outcome of pediatric uveitis.
DESIGN: Retrospective, longitudinal observation.
PARTICIPANTS: Five hundred twenty-seven pediatric uveitis patients from the National Eye Institute, University of Illinois, Chicago, and Oregon Health Sciences University.
METHODS: Retrospective chart review.
MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Demographics, uveitis disease characteristics, complications, treatments, and visual outcomes were determined at baseline and at 1-, 3-, 5-, and 10-year time points.
RESULTS: The patient population was 54% female; 62.4% white, 12.5% black, 2.7% Asian, 2.1% multiracial, and 14.61% Hispanic. Median age at diagnosis was 9.4 years. The leading diagnoses were idiopathic uveitis (28.8%), juvenile idiopathic arthritis-associated uveitis (20.9%), and pars planitis (17.1%). Insidious onset (58%) and persistent duration (75.3%) were most common. Anterior uveitis was predominant (44.6%). Complications were frequent, and cystoid macular edema (odds ratio [OR] 2.94; P = 0.006) and hypotony (OR, 4.54; P = 0.026) had the most significant visual impact. Ocular surgery was performed in 18.9% of patients. The prevalence of legal blindness was 9.23% at baseline, 6.52% at 1 year, 3.17% at 3 years, 15.15% at 5 years, and 7.69% at 10 years. Posterior uveitis and panuveitis had more severe vision loss. Hispanic ethnicity was associated with a higher prevalence of infectious uveitis and vision loss at baseline.
CONCLUSIONS: The rate and spectrum of vision threatening complications of pediatric uveitis are significant. Prospective studies using standard outcome measures and including diverse populations are needed to identify children most at risk.",88,2009-Aug-1

To analyse the prevalence and complications of uveitis and their predictors in a large cohort of patients with juvenile idiopathic arthritis (JIA).
METHODS: Data of 3271 JIA patients as classified by International League of Associations for Rheumatology (ILAR) criteria included in a national database during 1 yr were analysed.
RESULTS: Uveitis prevalence was 12% of all JIA patients. The most frequent were oligoarthritis extended (25%) and persistent (16%). JIA patients with uveitis were significantly younger at onset of arthritis (3.8 vs 7.0 yrs) or ANA-positive (86% vs 42%) than the patients without uveitis. Predictors of uveitis included age at onset (P= 0.03) and ANA-positivity (P< 0.01) besides the presence of a certain JIA subgroup (P= 0.04). Uveitis was clinically silent in 75% of the oligoarthritis but in none of the enthesitis-related arthritis patients. The median onset of uveitis was 5.5 months after arthritis manifestation. In 73%, 77% and 90%, uveitis developed within 1, 2 and 4 yrs after arthritis, respectively. Anterior uveitis was the most common anatomic type of uveitis (83%). Uveitis complications at mean follow-up of 5.6 yrs were common (56%), and predictors for complications included presence of complications at first visit (P< 0.001) and uveitis manifestation before arthritis (P= 0.001), but not ANA positivity.
CONCLUSIONS: The JIA subgroups markedly differ with respect to the prevalence and course of associated uveitis. Ophthalmological screening should be initiated early after arthritis onset and the intervals be related to the JIA subgroup. A modification of the current screening guidelines is suggested.",88,2007-Jun-1

Uveitis, a complex intraocular inflammatory disease results from several etiological entities. Causes of uveitis are known to vary in different populations depending upon the ecological, racial and socioeconomic variations of the population studied. Tropical countries are unique in their climate, prevailing pathogens and in the existing diseases, which further influence the epidemiological and geographical distribution of specific entities. We provide an overview of the pattern of uveitis of 15221 cases in 24 case series reported from several countries over 35 years (1972-2007) and we integrate it with our experience of an additional 8759 cases seen over six years (1996-2001) at a large community-based eye hospital. Uveitis accounted for 0.8% of our hospital-based outpatient visits. The uveitis was idiopathic in 44.6%, the most commonly identified entities in the cohort included leptospiral uveitis (9.7%), tuberculous uveitis (5.6%) and herpetic uveitis (4.9%). The most common uveitis in children below 16 years (616 patients; 7.0% of the total cohort) was pediatric parasitic anterior uveitis, (182 children, 29.5% of the pediatric cohort), whereas the most common uveitis in patients above 60 years (642 patients; 7.3% of the total cohort) was herpetic anterior uveitis, (78 patients, 12.1% of the elderly cohort). Etiologies varied with the age group of the patients. As in other tropical countries, a high prevalence of infectious uveitis was seen in this population.",87,2007-1-1

To characterize the clinical features of Vogt-Koyanagi-Harada syndrome (VKH) in Chinese patients.
DESIGN: Retrospective noncomparative case series.
PARTICIPANTS: A total of 410 consecutive VKH patients examined from August 1995 to April 2005.
METHODS: Charts of these patients were reviewed according to international VKH criteria. Patients who consulted us within 2 weeks after a uveitis attack were classified into group 1; between 2 weeks and 2 months into group 2; and after 2 months into group 3. The history and clinical findings of all of the patients were reviewed. Laser flare-cell photometry, fundus fluorescein angiography, indocyanine green angiography, optical coherence tomography, B-scan ultrasonography, and ultrasound biomicroscopy were performed in certain cases. Corticosteroids were mainly used to treat patients in groups 1 and 2, whereas cyclosporine or chlorambucil in combination with corticosteroids were prescribed for patients in group 3.
MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Demographics, clinical presentation, and ancillary examinations of the patients in all 3 groups.
RESULTS: The patients were diagnosed as having either complete (n = 273), incomplete (n = 76), or probable (n = 61) VKH syndrome. Exudative retinal detachment and either choroiditis or chorioretinitis were the main findings in group 1. Posterior uveitis with mild to moderate anterior uveitis simulating a nongranulomatous inflammation as evidenced by dust keratic precipitates, anterior chamber cells, and flare was noted in group 2. Recurrent granulomatous anterior uveitis with a ""sunset glow"" fundus was observed in group 3. Complicated cataract was the most common complication in the patients in group 3. At the final visit, the uveitis was completely controlled in all patients and a best-corrected visual acuity of <20/200 was 1.9%/eye-year, 1.2%/eye-year, and 6%/eye-year in groups 1, 2, and 3, respectively.
CONCLUSION: Vogt-Koyanagi-Harada syndrome in Chinese patients is characterized by early posterior uveitis, and if the syndrome is not controlled, subsequent recurrent granulomatous anterior uveitis. Good visual prognosis is possible if the patients are managed according to a tailored immunosuppressive treatment protocol.",84,2007-Mar-1

Autoimmune uveitis is a blinding disease presenting with autoantibodies against eye-specific proteins as well as autoagressive T cells invading and attacking the immune-privileged target tissue retina. The molecular events enabling T cells to invade and attack the tissue have remained elusive. Changes in membrane protein expression patterns between diseased and healthy stages are especially interesting because initiating events of disease will most likely occur at membranes. Since disease progression is accompanied with a break-down of the blood-retinal barrier, serum-derived proteins mask the potential target tissue-related changes. To overcome this limitation, we used membrane-enriched fractions derived from retinas of the only available spontaneous animal model for the disease equine recurrent uveitis, and compared expression levels by a label-free LC-MSMS-based strategy to healthy control samples. We could readily identify a total of 893 equine proteins with 57% attributed to the Gene Ontology project term ""membrane."" Of these, 179 proteins were found differentially expressed in equine recurrent uveitis tissue. Pathway enrichment analyses indicated an increase in proteins related to antigen processing and presentation, TNF receptor signaling, integrin cell surface interactions and focal adhesions. Additionally, loss of retina-specific proteins reflecting decrease of vision was observed as well as an increase in Müller glial cell-specific proteins indicating glial reactivity. Selected protein candidates (caveolin 1, integrin alpha 1 and focal adhesion kinase) were validated by immunohistochemistry and tissue staining pattern pointed to a significant increase of these proteins at the level of the outer limiting membrane which is part of the outer blood-retinal barrier. Taken together, the membrane enrichment in combination with LC-MSMS-based label-free quantification greatly increased the sensitivity of the comparative tissue profiling and resulted in detection of novel molecular pathways related to equine recurrent uveitis.",80,2010-Oct-1

Vogt-Koyanagi-Harada (VKH) disease is one of the major vision-threatening diseases in certain populations, such as Asians, native Americans, Hispanics and Middle Easterners. It is characterized by bilateral uveitis that is frequently associated with neurological (meningeal), auditory, and integumentary manifestations. Although the etiology and pathogenesis of VKH disease need to be further elucidated, it is widely accepted that the clinical manifestations are caused by an autoimmune response directed against melanin associated antigens in the target organs, i.e. the eye, inner ear, meninges and skin. In the past decades, accumulating evidence has shown that genetic factors, including VKH disease specific risk factors (HLA-DR4) and general risk factors for immune mediated diseases (IL-23R), dysfunction of immune responses, including the innate and adaptive immune system and environmental triggering factors are all involved in the development of VKH disease. Clinically, the criteria of diagnosis for VKH disease have been further improved by the employment of novel imaging techniques for the eye. For the treatment, early and adequate corticosteroids are still the mainstream regime for the disease. However, immunosuppressive and biological agents have shown benefit for the treatment of VKH disease, especially for those patients not responding to corticosteroids. This review is focused on our current knowledge of VKH disease, especially for the diagnosis, pathogenesis (genetic factors and immune mechanisms), ancillary tests and treatment. A better understanding of the role of microbiome composition, genetic basis and ongoing immune processes along with the development of novel biomarkers and objective quantitative assays to monitor intraocular inflammation are needed to improve current management of VKH patients.",79,2016-May-1

Vogt-Koyanagi-Harada disease, a severe bilateral granulomatous intraocular inflammation associated with serous retinal detachments, disk edema, and vitritis, with eventual development of a sunset glow fundus, is an autoimmune inflammatory condition mediated by T cells that target melanocytes in individuals susceptible to the disease. Vogt-Koyanagi-Harada disease presents clinically in 4 different phases: prodromal, uveitic, convalescent, and recurrent, with extraocular manifestations including headache, meningismus, hearing loss, poliosis, and vitiligo, to varying degrees. There have been considerable advances in imaging modalities resulting in earlier diagnosis and improved understanding of this disease. Ocular coherence tomography has replaced other imaging modalities in the diagnosis of acute and chronic Vogt-Koyanagi-Harada disease by revealing exudative detachments of the retina in the acute stage, along with choroidal thickening and demonstrating choroidal thinning in the chronic stage. Treatment of this disease is initially with corticosteroids, with a transition to immunomodulatory drugs for long-term control. Patients with Vogt-Koyanagi-Harada disease can have good final outcomes if treated promptly and aggressively and thus avoid complications such as sunset glow fundus, cataracts, glaucoma, subretinal fibrosis, and choroidal neovascularization.",79,2017-1-1

To extensively characterize the complex network of cytokines present in uveitis aqueous humor (AqH), and the relationships between cytokines and the cellular infiltrate.
METHODS: AqH from noninflammatory control subjects and patients with idiopathic, Fuchs' heterochromic cyclitis (FHC), and herpes-viral or Behçet's uveitis were analyzed for IL-1beta, -2, -4, -5, -7, -8, -10, -12, -13, -15, TNFalpha, IFNgamma, CCL2 (MCP-1), CCL5 (RANTES), CCL11 (Eotaxin), TGFbeta2, and CXCL12 (SDF-1), using multiplex bead immunoassays. The cellular infiltrate was also determined for each sample.
RESULTS: Idiopathic uveitis AqH, compared with noninflammatory controls, was characterized by high levels of IL-6, IL-8, CCL2 and IFNgamma, the levels of which correlated with each other. For IL-6 and IL-8 these levels were proportional to the number of neutrophils present. By contrast, the levels of both TGFbeta2 and CXCL12 decreased in idiopathic uveitis AqH with increasing inflammation. Cluster analysis showed a degree of segregation between noninflammatory and idiopathic uveitis AqH. Further examination using random forest analysis yielded a complete distinction between these two groups. The minimum cytokines required for this classification were IL-6, IL-8, CCL2, IL-13, TNFalpha, and IL-2.
CONCLUSIONS: Application of multiplex bead immunoassays has allowed us to identify distinct patterns of cytokines that relate to both clinical disease and the cellular infiltrates present. Bioinformatics analysis allowed identification of cytokines that differentiate idiopathic uveitis from noninflammatory control AqH and are likely to be important for the pathogenesis of uveitis.",78,2005-Nov-1

To analyze the referral patterns and diagnosis of uveitis during the past decade in a large tertiary eye center.
DESIGN: The records of 1237 patients with uveitis referred to the Immunology Service of the Massachusetts Eye and Ear Infirmary from 1982 to 1992 were classified and analyzed. Data regarding sex, race, nationality, referral site, ages at presentation and onset of uveitis, ocular involvement, clinical characteristics, ocular condition, and systemic disease associations were obtained.
RESULTS: The mean age at onset of uveitis was 37.2 years; the male-to-female ratio was 1:1.4. Most patients were white (85.8%), born in the United States (83.1%), and referred from within New England (84.7%). Anterior uveitis was most common (51.6%), followed by posterior uveitis (19.4%), panuveitis (16.0%), and intermediate uveitis (13.0%). Chronic (58.3%), nongranulomatous (77.7%), and noninfectious (83.1%) were the most frequent types of uveitis. The most common entities included idiopathic (34.9%), seronegative spondyloarthropathies (10.4%), sarcoidosis (9.6%), juvenile rheumatoid arthritis (5.6%), systemic lupus erythematosus (4.8%), Behçet's disease (2.5%), and the acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (2.4%).
CONCLUSION: The appearance of new uveitic entities, such as the acute retinal necrosis syndrome, multifocal choroiditis and panuveitis, birdshot retinochoroidopathy, and acquired immunodeficiency syndrome-related uveitis, and the reemergence of the classic infectious causes of uveitis, tuberculosis and syphilis, have changed the way we approach the diagnosis and management of posterior and panuveitis at the Massachusetts Eye and Ear Infirmary.",78,1996-May-1

An international, expert-led consensus initiative to develop systematic, evidence-based recommendations for the treatment of noninfectious uveitis in the era of biologics.
CLINICAL RELEVANCE: The availability of biologic agents for the treatment of human eye disease has altered practice patterns for the management of noninfectious uveitis. Current guidelines are insufficient to assure optimal use of noncorticosteroid systemic immunomodulatory agents.
METHODS: An international expert steering committee comprising 9 uveitis specialists (including both ophthalmologists and rheumatologists) identified clinical questions and, together with 6 bibliographic fellows trained in uveitis, conducted a Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses protocol systematic review of the literature (English language studies from January 1996 through June 2016; Medline [OVID], the Central Cochrane library, EMBASE, CINAHL, SCOPUS, BIOSIS, and Web of Science). Publications included randomized controlled trials, prospective and retrospective studies with sufficient follow-up, case series with 15 cases or more, peer-reviewed articles, and hand-searched conference abstracts from key conferences. The proposed statements were circulated among 130 international uveitis experts for review. A total of 44 globally representative group members met in late 2016 to refine these guidelines using a modified Delphi technique and assigned Oxford levels of evidence.
RESULTS: In total, 10 questions were addressed resulting in 21 evidence-based guidance statements covering the following topics: when to start noncorticosteroid immunomodulatory therapy, including both biologic and nonbiologic agents; what data to collect before treatment; when to modify or withdraw treatment; how to select agents based on individual efficacy and safety profiles; and evidence in specific uveitic conditions. Shared decision-making, communication among providers and safety monitoring also were addressed as part of the recommendations. Pharmacoeconomic considerations were not addressed.
CONCLUSIONS: Consensus guidelines were developed based on published literature, expert opinion, and practical experience to bridge the gap between clinical needs and medical evidence to support the treatment of patients with noninfectious uveitis with noncorticosteroid immunomodulatory agents.",77,2018-May-1

Vogt-Koyanagi-Harada disease (VKHD) is a rare granulomatous inflammatory disease that affects pigmented structures, such as eye, inner ear, meninges, skin and hair. This disease is mainly a Th1 lymphocyte mediated aggression to melanocytes after a viral trigger in the presence of HLA-DRB1*0405 allele. The absence of ocular trauma or previous intraocular surgery sets VKHD appart from sympathetic ophthalmia, its main differential diagnosis. The disease has an acute onset of bilateral blurred vision with hyperemia preceded by flu-like symptoms. The acute uveitic stage is characterized by a diffuse choroiditis with serous retinal detachment and optic disc hyperemia and edema. Fluorescein angiography in this phase demonstrates multiple early hyperfluorescent points. After the acute uveitic stage, ocular and integumentary system pigmentary changes may appear. Ocular findings may be accompanied by lymphocytic meningitis, hearing impairment and/or tinnitus in a variable proportion of patients. Prompt diagnosis followed by early, aggressive and long-term treatment with high-dose corticosteroids is most often ensued by good visual outcomes. However, some patients may experience chronic uveal inflammation with functional eye deterioration. The current review discusses the general features of VKHD, including epidemiology, classification into categories, differential diagnosis and current therapeutic approaches.",75,2016-Mar-24

To investigate the impact of cystoid macular edema (CME) on visual acuity in patients with uveitis.
DESIGN: Cross-sectional study.
PARTICIPANTS: The data from 529 patients (842 eyes) with uveitis were analyzed.
MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: We recorded gender and age of the patients, anatomic site and diagnosis of uveitis, associations with systemic diseases, onset and duration of uveitis, presence of CME, best-corrected visual acuity, and the causes of decrease in visual acuity.
RESULTS: Cystoid macular edema was noted in 175 (33%) of all uveitis patients, of whom 77 (44%) had visual acuity of 20/60 or less in at least 1 eye. The mean visual acuity for eyes with CME was significantly worse than for eyes without CME (0.25 vs. 0.4; P = 0.003). Of all uveitis patients, 185 (35%) had visual acuity of 20/60 or less in at least 1 eye, which was caused by CME in 77 (42%) patients. Poor visual acuity in patients with CME was associated with the advanced age of the patients, chronic inflammation, and various specific uveitis entities. The development of visually impaired or blind eyes in patients with panuveitis and intermediate uveitis was caused in most cases by CME (59% and 85%, respectively).
CONCLUSIONS: Cystoid macular edema was a major cause of visual loss in patients with uveitis. The unsatisfactory visual acuity in patients with uveitis underlines the need for improved management of this complication.",75,2006-Aug-1

Autoimmune uveitis is a complex group of sight-threatening diseases that arise without a known infectious trigger. The disorder is often associated with immunological responses to retinal proteins. Experimental models of autoimmune uveitis targeting retinal proteins have led to a better understanding of the basic immunological mechanisms involved in the pathogenesis of uveitis and have provided a template for the development of novel therapies. The disease in humans is believed to be T cell-dependent, as clinical uveitis is ameliorated by T cell-targeting therapies. The roles of T helper 1 (Th1) and Th17 cells have been major topics of interest in the past decade. Studies in uveitis patients and experiments in animal models have revealed that Th1 and Th17 cells can both be pathogenic effectors, although, paradoxically, some cytokines produced by these subsets can also be protective, depending on when and where they are produced. The major proinflammatory as well as regulatory cytokines in uveitis, the therapeutic approaches, and benefits of targeting these cytokines will be discussed in this review.",73,2011-Oct-1

Uveitis is reported to be the most common extra-articular manifestation in spondyloarthritis (SpA); however, its prevalence and characteristics are not well established.
OBJECTIVE: To perform a systematic literature review in order to examine these topics.
METHODS: A systematic literature analysis was conducted in the Medline database up to October 2006 and in the abstracts of rheumatology scientific meetings for the years 2004, 2005 and 2006. A hand search of references was also performed. Articles were analysed if they reported the prevalence or characteristics of uveitis in SpA. Data abstraction was standardised. Statistical analysis was mainly descriptive.
RESULTS: Among the 957 articles selected by the search, 126 articles (29,877 patients) allowed a calculation of the prevalence of uveitis in SpA; 36 articles (1989 patients) described its characteristics. The mean (SD) prevalence of uveitis was 32.7 (0.5)%; it varied with the type of SpA--for example, 33.2 (0.8)% for ankylosing spondylitis versus 25.1 (2.3)% for psoriatic arthritis. This prevalence increased with mean disease duration and was higher in HLA-B27-positive patients with an odds ratio of 4.2. Uveitis was acute in 88.7 (2.5)%, anterior in 90.5 (2.0)%, unilateral in 87.3 (2.8)%. Recurrence occurred in 50.6 (2.6)% and a reduction of visual acuity was observed in 8.3 (3.8)%.
CONCLUSION: The prevalence of uveitis varies with disease duration and according to the type of SpA. Reduction of visual acuity is not exceptional. Because of recent promising data about the effects of anti-tumour necrosis factor therapy on uveitis flares in SpA, it was important to determine this baseline prevalence.",73,2008-Jul-1

Uveitis is an autoimmune disease of the eye that refers to any of a number of intraocular inflammatory conditions. Because it is a rare disease, uveitis is often overlooked, and the possible associations between uveitis and extra-ocular disease manifestations are not well known. The aim of this study was to characterize uveitis in a large sample of patients and to evaluate the relationship between uveitis and systemic diseases.
METHODS: The present study is a cross-sectional study of a cohort of patients with uveitis. Records from consecutive uveitis patients who were seen by the Uveitis Service in the Department of Ophthalmology at the Medical University of Vienna between 1995 and 2009 were selected from the clinical databases. The cases were classified according to the Standardization of Uveitis Nomenclature Study Group criteria for Uveitis.
RESULTS: Data were available for 2619 patients, of whom 59.9% suffered from anterior, 14.8% from intermediate, 18.3% from posterior and 7.0% from panuveitis. 37.2% of all cases showed an association between uveitis and extra-organ diseases; diseases with primarily arthritic manifestations were seen in 10.1% of all cases, non-infectious systemic diseases (i.e., Behçet´s disease, sarcoidosis or multiple sclerosis) in 8.4% and infectious uveitis in 18.7%. 49.4% of subjects suffering from anterior uveitis tested positively for the HLA-B27 antigen. In posterior uveitis cases 29% were caused by ocular toxoplasmosis and 17.7% by multifocal choroiditis.
CONCLUSION: Ophthalmologists, rheumatologists, infectiologists, neurologists and general practitioners should be familiar with the differential diagnosis of uveitis. A better interdisciplinary approach could help in tailoring of the work-up, earlier diagnosis of co-existing diseases and management of uveitis patients.",73,2012-Aug-29

Glaucoma and cataract can be complications from inflammation itself or adverse effects from therapy. Ophthalmic manifestations can be isolated or associated with other organ involvement. Patients with ocular sarcoidosis can present with a wide range of clinical presentations and severity.

To develop recommendations for the screening, monitoring, and treatment of uveitis in children with juvenile idiopathic arthritis (JIA).
METHODS: Pediatric rheumatologists, ophthalmologists with expertise in uveitis, patient representatives, and methodologists generated key clinical questions to be addressed by this guideline. This was followed by a systematic literature review and rating of the available evidence according to the GRADE (Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development and Evaluation) methodology. A group consensus process was used to compose the final recommendations and grade their strength as conditional or strong.
RESULTS: Due to a lack of literature with good quality of evidence, recommendations were formulated on the basis of available evidence and a consensus expert opinion. Regular ophthalmic screening of children with JIA is recommended because of the risk of uveitis, and the frequency of screening should be based on individual risk factors. Regular ophthalmic monitoring of children with uveitis is recommended, and intervals should be based on ocular examination findings and treatment regimen. Ophthalmic monitoring recommendations were strong primarily because of concerns of vision-threatening complications of uveitis with infrequent monitoring. Topical glucocorticoids should be used as initial treatment to achieve control of inflammation. Methotrexate and the monoclonal antibody tumor necrosis factor inhibitors adalimumab and infliximab are recommended when systemic treatment is needed for the management of uveitis. The timely addition of nonbiologic and biologic drugs is recommended to maintain uveitis control in children who are at continued risk of vision loss.
CONCLUSION: This guideline provides direction for clinicians and patients/parents making decisions on the screening, monitoring, and management of children with JIA and uveitis, using GRADE methodology and informed by a consensus process with input from rheumatology and ophthalmology experts, current literature, and patient/parent preferences and values.",70,2019-Jun-1

Uveitis is a sight-threatening disease caused by autoimmune or infection-related immune responses. Studies in experimental autoimmune uveitis and in human diseases imply that activated CD4(+) T cells, Th1 and Th17 cells, play an effector role in ocular inflammation. The eye has a unique regional immune system to protect vision-related cells and tissues from these effector T cells. The immunological balance between the pathogenic CD4(+) T cells and regional immune system in the eye contributes to the maintenance of ocular homeostasis and good vision. Current studies have demonstrated that ocular parenchymal cells at the inner surface of the blood-ocular barrier, i.e. corneal endothelial (CE) cells, iris pigment epithelial (PE) cells, ciliary body PE cells, and retinal PE cells, contribute to the regional immune system of the eye. Murine ocular resident cells directly suppress activation of bystander T cells and production of inflammatory cytokines. The ocular resident cells possess distinct properties of immunoregulation that are related to disparate anatomical location. CE cells and iris PE cells, which are located at the anterior segment of the eye and face the aqueous humor, suppress activation of T cells via cell-to-cell contact mechanisms, whereas retinal PE cells suppress the activation of T cells via soluble factors. In addition to direct immune suppression, the ocular resident cells have another unique immunosuppressive property, the induction of CD25(+)Foxp3(+) Treg cells that also suppress the activation of bystander T cells. Iris PE cells convert CD8(+) T cells into Treg cells, while retinal PE cells convert CD4(+) T cells greatly and CD8(+) T cells moderately into Treg cells. CE cells also convert both CD4(+) T cells and CD8(+) T cells into Treg cells. The immunomodulation by ocular resident cells is mediated by various soluble or membrane-bound molecules that include TGF-β TSP-1, B7-2 (CD86), CTLA-2α, PD-L1 (B7-H1), galectin 1, pigment epithelial-derived factor PEDF), GIRTL, and retinoic acid. Human retinal PE cells also possess similar immune properties to induce Treg cells. Although there are many issues to be answered, human Treg cells induced by ocular resident cells such as retinal PE cells and related immunosuppressive molecules can be applied as immune therapy for refractive autoimmune uveitis in humans in the future.",70,2013-Mar-1

Seroepidemiological, clinical and virological studies were carried out in an HTLV-I endemic area to find out if HTLV-I caused an intraocular inflammatory disorder, uveitis. The seroprevalence in patients with uveitis without defined etiologies (62/175, 35.4%) was significantly higher than that in patients with non-uveitic ocular diseases (42/261, 16.1%) or in patients with uveitis with defined etiologies (8/78, 10.3%). Moreover, the seroprevalence in young adults (20-49 years) with uveitis without defined etiologies was 30/67 (44.8%), whereas it was only 10/107 (9.3%) in the other two groups. The uveitis in HTLV-I carriers was characterized clinically by a moderate inflammation of the vitreous body accompanied by a mild iritis and retinal vasculitis. The proviral DNA of HTLV-I was detected by polymerase chain reaction from the inflammatory cells in the anterior chamber in 9 out of 9 seropositive patients with the uveitis, but not in any of the tested patients with other types of uveitis. These data, thus, indicate that HTLV-I causes a specific type of intraocular inflammation, uveitis.",69,1992-Mar-1

Microbial agents have an important role in the pathogenesis of various inflammatory eye diseases, such as uveitis and keratitis. Microbial infections of the eye such as microbial keratitis, ocular onchocerciasis, bacterial endophthalmitis, viral retinitis, and other infectious uveitis are unfortunately common. In addition, microbial agents have been implicated in the pathogenesis of ""non-infectious"" immune mediated diseases such as HLA-B27 associated acute anterior uveitis. Toll-like receptors (TLR) are a family of pattern recognition receptors that initiates rapid host innate immune response to microbial components known as pathogen associated molecular patterns, which are unique to a given class of microbes, such as lipopolysaccharide of Gram negative bacteria. Recent in vitro and in vivo studies have demonstrated the expression and function of TLRs in the eye, with significant implications for better understanding of ocular immunity and the pathogenesis of inflammatory eye diseases affecting the cornea, uvea, and retina.",69,2006-Jan-1

Of 532 cases of sarcoidosis in the southeastern United States, ocular manifestations were a prominent feature of the disease in 202 (38%) of the patients. Approximately one fifth of them sought medical attention because of ocular complaints. This was the second most frequent clinical manifestation, exceeded only by pulmonary symptoms. When ocular segment structures were affected, the anterior segment was involved in 171 (84.7%) of cases. Chronic granulomatous uveitis was the most common abnormality in 106 cases (52.5%). Posterior segment disease occurred in 51 (25.3%) of cases, usually in the form of chorioretinitis or preiphlebitis; it was sometimes the sole manifestation of ocular sarcoidosis, but usually accompanied abnormalities in the anterior part of the eye. The incidence of central nervous system sarcoidosis was increased when posterior segment involvement was observed. Orbital and adnexal structures, primarily lacrimal gland, were affected in 53 (27.7%) of cases.",68,1978-Nov-1

PMID: 23668682
To describe an approach to diagnosing the uveitides, a collection of about 30 separate diseases characterized by intraocular inflammation.
DESIGN: Perspective.
METHODS: Integration of clinical approach with a more formal, informatics-derived approach to characterization and a Bayesian approach to laboratory testing.
RESULTS: The patient's uveitis is characterized along several dimensions: course, laterality, anatomic location of the inflammation, morphology, presence of active infection, and the host (age, presence of a systemic disease). Posterior uveitis can be characterized further by whether it is primarily a retinitis, choroiditis, or retinal vasculitis; by whether it is paucifocal or multifocal; and by the morphology of the lesions. This characterization narrows the differential diagnosis to 1 or, at most, a few diseases. Laboratory screening (ie, testing all patients) should be reserved for those diseases that can present as any type of uveitis, whereas targeted testing (ie, testing a subset with specific features) is used selectively. Laboratory testing should be used to identify an infection (which will alter therapy) or a systemic disease that will affect the patient's health. A uveitis that is not one of the established diagnoses is designated as ""undifferentiated"" with the course, laterality, and anatomic location (eg, undifferentiated bilateral chronic anterior uveitis). We avoid the term ""idiopathic"" uveitis as most identified noninfectious uveitic diseases are idiopathic, and most systemic diseases associated with uveitis also are idiopathic (eg, juvenile idiopathic arthritis).
CONCLUSION: This approach should lead to the correct diagnosis of the specific uveitic disease in the large majority of cases without overuse of laboratory testing.",67,2013-Aug-1

PMID: 22075279
Ankylosing spondylitis (AS) is the most frequent and most severe subtype of spondyloarthritis and can be an outcome of any of the other spondyloarthritis subtypes. It primarily affects the axial joints, most notably the sacroiliac joints. Other sites of involvement include the spine, peripheral joints, and entheses (capsules, ligaments, and tendons). Inflammatory enthesopathy progressing to ossification and ankylosis is the pathologic basis for the disease. Extra-articular manifestations vary widely in terms of both frequency and severity. The most common extra-articular manifestations are represented by uveitis, bowel disease, heart, lung, skin, bone and kidney involvement. This review focuses on prevalence and clinical characteristics of the most common extra-articular manifestations in AS, and discuss the diagnosis and therapeutic difficulties that rheumatologists faces when dealing with such manifestations. The advantages of treatment with non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs), especially if continuous use is envisaged, should be weighted against possible gastrointestinal and cardiovascular disadvantages. In the presence of history of gastrointestinal complaints or a high cardiovascular risk, NSAIDs should be used with caution. TNF inhibition has demonstrated effectiveness in the treatment of AS symptoms and all currently available anti-TNF agents appear to have similar efficacy. However, the efficacy of anti-TNF agents varies in the presence of extra-articular manifestations. Etanercept appears to have very little effect on inflammatory bowel disease and limited efficacy on the course of uveitis probably inferior to the monoclonal antibodies infliximab and adalimumab.",67,2011-Dec-1

To assess the prevalence, risk factors, and long-term outcome of uveitis in patients with juvenile idiopathic arthritis (JIA).
METHODS: An inception cohort of all 1,081 patients diagnosed as having JIA at a single tertiary care center was established. A questionnaire and followup telephone calls were used to confirm the diagnosis of uveitis. Ophthalmologists' records of patients with uveitis were collected. Kaplan-Meier and Cox regression analyses were used to assess risk factors for developing uveitis and for complications of uveitis.
RESULTS: After a mean followup time of 6.9 years, 142 of 1,081 patients (13.1%) had developed uveitis. Risk factors were young age at diagnosis, female sex, antinuclear antibody positivity, and the subtype of JIA. The relative contribution of these risk factors was different for the different subtypes of JIA. Until the end of the study, uveitis complications had developed in 53 of 142 patients with uveitis (37.3%; 4.9% of the total cohort). Only 16 of 175 involved eyes (9.1%) in 14 of 108 patients (13%; 1.3% of the total cohort) for whom ophthalmology reports were available had best corrected visual acuity less than 20/40 (mean followup time for uveitis of 6.3 years). Abnormal vision was associated with synechiae or cataract.
CONCLUSION: Risk factors for developing uveitis were different among subtypes of JIA. The long-term outcome of JIA-associated uveitis in our cohort was excellent despite the high rate of complications.",66,2007-Feb-1

To determine the cumulative proportion and the visual significance of ocular complications of pediatric uveitis.
DESIGN: Cohort study.
PARTICIPANTS: Patients with onset of endogenous or infectious uveitis before or at age 16 years.
METHODS: Retrospective review of existing records at a university-based uveitis clinic.
MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Type and prevalence of complications related to uveitis, time to development of complications, and vision loss after initial diagnosis.
RESULTS: There were 148 patients, 71 males and 77 females, with a mean age of 10.4+/-4.9 years (median, 10.3 years) for an estimated prevalence of pediatric uveitis of 13.8%. Noninfectious uveitis was present in 112 patients (75.7%); 105 (71%) patients had bilateral disease. Anterior uveitis accounted for 30.4%, intermediate uveitis for 27.7%, posterior uveitis for 23.7%, and panuveitis for 18.2% of patients. Patients were followed for a mean of 71.7 months (range, 0 months-44 years) after diagnosis. Approximately 34% of all patients had 1 or more complications at the time of first diagnosis of uveitis by an ophthalmologist, increasing to 61.6% by 3 months, 69.4% by 6 months, 75.2% by 1 year, and 86.3% by 3 years after diagnosis. There were a total of 617 complications of all types. Anterior and intermediate uveitis had a higher risk of band keratopathy (P = 0.005). Posterior and intermediate uveitis had a lower risk of cataract (P = 0.009) or posterior synechiae (P<0.001). Intermediate uveitis had a higher risk of cystoid macular edema compared with anterior or posterior uveitis (P = 0.002). The cumulative percentages (standard error) of patients with first loss to 20/200 or worse after diagnosis in the affected eyes of unilateral cases or in either eye of the bilateral cases were: 31.3% (3.9) at 1 month; 40.5% (4.1) at 6 months; 56.0% (4.3) at 24 months; and 69.6% (4.5) at 60 months. Fifty-four patients (48.2%) received systemic antiinflammatory or immunomodulatory therapy. Sixty-eight patients (45.9%) had ocular surgery, and 38 of these had ocular surgery in both eyes.

Given the recent increased focus on evidence-based medicine, it is critical that diseases and syndromes have accurate and complete descriptions, including standardized and widely accepted terminologies. Standardizing these descriptions and terminologies is necessary to develop tools such as computerized data entry forms and classification criteria. This need is especially true for diseases that are relatively uncommon, such as uveitis.
OBJECTIVES: To develop a standardized and internationally accepted terminology for the field of uveitis.
METHODS: The Standardization of Uveitis Nomenclature (SUN) Working Group (WG) is an international group of 79 uveitis experts from 18 countries and 62 clinical centers. Initial terminology was developed utilizing a ""modified"" green field approach, which was enhanced through web-based surveys and teleconferences via a ""modified"" Delphi technique. Terms were mapped provisionally into ontologic dimensions for each syndrome. The Working Group then met and utilized nominal group techniques as a formalized method of finalizing the mappings.
RESULTS: Mapping of terms into dimensions to describe 28 major uveitic diseases was confirmed using nominal group techniques (achieving super-majority consensus) for each of the diseases at a meeting of the entire WG.
CONCLUSIONS: The SUN WG utilized an informatics-based approach to develop a standardized and internationally accepted terminology for the uveitides.",65,2013-1-1

To ascertain the frequency of uveitis in Veterans Affairs (VA) patients in the Pacific Northwest and to compare disease rates with those in previously published epidemiologic studies.
DESIGN: Cross-sectional, population based-study.
METHODS: The medical records of 152,267 patients seen at six VA Medical Centers in Oregon and Washington during fiscal year 2004 were searched for uveitis-related International Classification of Diseases 9th edition codes. Cases were reviewed and classified anatomically, by associated systemic disease, and as incident or prevalent. Only definite cases were used for disease rate calculations.
RESULTS: This study found a crude incidence of 25.6 cases/100,000 person-years and a crude prevalence of 69 cases/100,000 persons. The most common anatomic location for uveitis was anterior. Approximately half of cases were idiopathic, with human leukocyte antigen-B27-related diseases being the most common identified cause. There was no statistical evidence of increased or decreased incidence with age, although uveitis seemed to be more prevalent in the younger age groups.
CONCLUSIONS: Our data are consistent with those of most published population-based studies on the epidemiologic features of uveitis, but we detected significantly lower incidence and prevalence than those reported in a recently published study from Kaiser Permanente. The significance of and possible explanations for the differences between our data and that published by the Kaiser group are discussed.",65,2008-Dec-1

To determine ocular signs predictive of tubercular uveitis.
DESIGN: Retrospective, nonrandomized, comparative interventional case study.
METHODS: Three hundred eighty-six patients with active uveitis were treated at a tertiary care single-center uveitis practice. Uveitis was presumed to be tubercular in patients who showed evidence of latent or manifest tuberculosis without any other known cause and who did not show recurrence of uveitis after 12 months of antitubercular therapy. One hundred eighty-two patients who thus obtained clinical diagnoses of presumed tubercular uveitis were enrolled in group A. Two hundred four patients with uveitis resulting from a nontubercular cause were enrolled in group B. Patients were monitored for the presence of types of keratic precipitates (mutton fat or fine), posterior synechiae (broad based or filiform), iris nodules, snowballs, snow banking, vasculitis (with or without choroiditis), serpiginous-like choroiditis, and other types of posterior uveitis (choroidal abscess, retinochoroiditis, or exudative retinal detachment) which were compared between the 2 groups. Statistical analysis was carried out at a 5% level of significance. The main outcome measures were clinical signs significantly associated with tubercular uveitis.
RESULTS: Broad-based posterior synechiae, retinal vasculitis with or without choroiditis, and serpiginous-like choroiditis were seen significantly more commonly in patients with tubercular uveitis. Filiform posterior synechiae were more frequent in eyes with nontubercular uveitis.
CONCLUSIONS: Broad-based posterior synechiae, retinal vasculitis with or without choroiditis, and serpiginous-like choroiditis in patients with latent or manifest tuberculosis in tuberculosis-endemic areas are suggestive of a tubercular cause of uveitis and merit specific treatment.",65,2010-Apr-1

METHODS: Healthy and uveitic subjects were recruited from 2 tertiary care eye centers. Prototype SD-OCTA devices (Cirrus; Carl Zeiss Meditec, Inc, Dublin, California, USA) were used to generate 3 × 3-mm
RESULTS: The SD, VD, and FD of the parafoveal capillaries were lower in uveitic eyes compared with healthy eyes in all retinal segments. In addition, SD and VD were significantly lower in the DRL of subjects with uveitic macular edema. There was no correlation in any capillary parameters and anatomic classification of uveitis.
CONCLUSIONS: Quantitative analysis of parafoveal capillary density and morphology in uveitis demonstrates significantly lower capillary density and complexity. SD-OCTA algorithms are robust enough to detect these changes and can provide a novel diagnostic index of disease for uveitis subjects.",64,2016-Nov-1

In 402 cases (67.0%) we established a specific diagnosis based on history, physical findings, and laboratory studies: 167 cases (27.8%) involved primarily the anterior segment, 230 (38.4%) the posterior segment, and 111 (18.4%) occurred as panuveitis. Intermediate uveitis (pars planitis) was the single most frequently diagnosed uveitic entity and accounted for 92 cases (15.4%).

We assayed aqueous humor (AH) samples from patients with Behçet's disease (BD), Vogt-Koyanagi-Harada (VKH) disease, and HLA-B27-associated uveitis and control patients for the proinflammatory cytokines IL-15, IL-17, interferon-γ and tumor necrosis factor-α and the immunosuppressive cytokine IL-10. Cytokine levels were significantly higher in the three disease groups than in controls. In patients with similar disease activity, levels of IL-15 and IFN-γ were significantly higher in BD patients than in VKH and HLA-B27-associated uveitis groups. Logistic regression identified a significant negative correlation between BD and high levels of IL-10 and a significant positive correlation between VKH disease and high levels of IL-10. The proinflammatory cytokines versus IL-10 ratios were significantly higher in BD compared with other groups. These data suggest that both T helper (Th) 1 and Th17 cells are involved in endogenous uveitis immunopathogenesis. BD is characterized by extensive Th1 polarization, severe proinflammatory conditions and a low immunosuppressive status.",63,2011-May-1

OBJECTIVES: To provide recommendations for the diagnosis and treatment of JIA-associated uveitis.
METHODS: Recommendations were developed by an evidence-informed consensus process using the European League Against Rheumatism standard operating procedures. A committee was constituted, consisting of nine experienced paediatric rheumatologists and three experts in ophthalmology from Europe. Recommendations derived from a validated systematic literature review were evaluated by an Expert Committee and subsequently discussed at two consensus meetings using nominal group techniques. Recommendations were accepted if >80% agreement was reached (including all three ophthalmologists).
RESULTS: In total, 22 recommendations were accepted (with >80% agreement among experts): 3 on diagnosis, 5 on disease activity measurements, 12 on treatment and 2 on future recommendations.
CONCLUSIONS: The SHARE initiative aims to identify best practices for treatment of patients suffering from JIA-associated uveitis.

The eye, as currently viewed, is neither immunologically ignorant nor sequestered from the systemic environment. The eye utilises distinct immunoregulatory mechanisms to preserve tissue and cellular function in the face of immune-mediated insult; clinically, inflammation following such an insult is termed uveitis. The intra-ocular inflammation in uveitis may be clinically obvious as a result of infection (e.g. toxoplasma, herpes), but in the main infection, if any, remains covert. We now recognise that healthy tissues including the retina have regulatory mechanisms imparted by control of myeloid cells through receptors (e.g. CD200R) and soluble inhibitory factors (e.g. alpha-MSH), regulation of the blood retinal barrier, and active immune surveillance. Once homoeostasis has been disrupted and inflammation ensues, the mechanisms to regulate inflammation, including T cell apoptosis, generation of Treg cells, and myeloid cell suppression in situ, are less successful. Why inflammation becomes persistent remains unknown, but extrapolating from animal models, possibilities include differential trafficking of T cells from the retina, residency of CD8(+) T cells, and alterations of myeloid cell phenotype and function. Translating lessons learned from animal models to humans has been helped by system biology approaches and informatics, which suggest that diseased animals and people share similar changes in T cell phenotypes and monocyte function to date. Together the data infer a possible cryptic infectious drive in uveitis that unlocks and drives persistent autoimmune responses, or promotes further innate immune responses. Thus there may be many mechanisms in common with those observed in autoinflammatory disorders.",62,2014-Sep-1

Ocular lesions, the main morbidity of Behcet's disease (BD), are the most difficult to treat. The aim of this study was to evaluate the efficacy of rituximab.
METHODS: Inclusion criteria were retinal vasculitis and edema, resistant to cytotoxic drugs. Twenty patients were randomized to a rituximab group (RG) or cytotoxic combination therapy group (CCTG). Rituximab was given in two 1000-mg courses (15-day interval). Subjects received methotrexate (15 mg/weekly) with prednisolone (0.5 mg/kg per day). The CCTG received pulse cyclophosphamide (1000 mg/monthly), azathioprine (2-3 mg/kg per day) and prednisolone (0.5 mg/kg per day). The primary endpoint was the overall state of patients' eyes and the Total Adjusted Disease Activity Index (TADAI). Secondary endpoints were: visual acuity (VA), posterior uveitis (PU), and retinal vasculitis (RV). The baseline data were compared at 6 months by paired sample t-test and analysis of variance.
RESULTS: TADAI improved significantly in the RG (t = 3.340, P = 0.009), but not in the CCTG (t = 2.241, P = 0.052). For secondary endpoints (RG/CCTG), the mean VA improved in two patients versus three (2/3), remained unchanged in 1/1, and worsened in 7/6 patients. The mean PU improved significantly in the RG (t = 3.943, P = 0.001), not in the CCTG (t = 2.371, P = 0.028). RV improved, but not statistically (t = 2.027, P = 0.057 vs. t = 1.045, P = 0.31). Edema of retina, disc and macula improved significantly in both, but much better for the RG (t = 2.781, P = 0.012 vs. t = 2.707, P = 0.014).
CONCLUSION: Rituximab was efficient in severe ocular manifestations of BD, TADAI improved significantly after 6 months with rituximab, but not with CCT.",62,2010-Aug-1

Blau syndrome is a monogenic disease resulting from mutations in the pattern recognition receptor NOD2, and is phenotypically characterized by the triad of granulomatous polyarthritis, dermatitis and uveitis. This paper reviews briefly the classical clinical features of the disease, as well as more recently described extra-triad symptoms. From an ongoing prospective multicenter study, we provide new data on the natural history of Blau syndrome, focusing on functional status and visual outcome. We also present an update of the range of different NOD2 mutations found in Blau syndrome as well as recent data on morphologic and immunohistochemical characteristics of the Blau granuloma. Finally, emerging insights into pathogenic mechanisms including activation of NOD2 signal transduction, and potential biomarkers of disease activity are discussed.",61,2014-1-1

To evaluate the comparative effectiveness of 3 regional corticosteroid injections for uveitic macular edema (ME): periocular triamcinolone acetonide (PTA), intravitreal triamcinolone acetonide (ITA), and the intravitreal dexamethasone implant (IDI).
DESIGN: Multicenter, randomized clinical trial.
PARTICIPANTS: Patients with uveitic ME.
METHODS: Patients were randomized 1:1:1 to receive 1 of the 3 therapies. Patients with bilateral ME were assigned the same treatment for both eyes.
MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: The primary outcome was the proportion of baseline (PropBL) central subfield thickness (CST) at 8 weeks (CST at 8 weeks/CST at baseline) assessed with OCT by masked readers. Secondary outcomes included ≥20% improvement and resolution of ME, best-corrected visual acuity (BCVA), and intraocular pressure (IOP) events over 24 weeks.
RESULTS: All treatment groups demonstrated improved CST during follow-up. At 8 weeks, each group had clinically meaningful reductions in CST relative to baseline (PropBL: 0.77, 0.61, and 0.54, respectively, which translates to reductions of 23%, 39%, and 46% for PTA, ITA, and IDI, respectively). Intravitreal triamcinolone acetonide (PropBL ITA/PropBL PTA, hazard ratio [HR], 0.79; 99.87% confidence interval [CI], 0.65-0.96) and IDI (PropBL IDI/PropBL PTA, HR, 0.69; 99.87% CI, 0.56-0.86) had larger reductions in CST than PTA (P < 0.0001). Intravitreal dexamethasone implant was noninferior to ITA at 8 weeks (PropBL IDI/PropBL ITA, HR, 0.88; 99.87% CI, 0.71-1.08). Both ITA and IDI treatments also were superior to PTA treatment in improving and resolving uveitic ME. All treatment groups demonstrated BCVA improvement throughout follow-up. Both ITA and IDI groups had improvements in BCVA that was 5 letters greater than in the PTA group at 8 weeks (P < 0.004). The risk of having IOP ≥24 mmHg was higher in the intravitreal treatment groups compared with the periocular group (HR, 1.83; 95% CI, 0.91-3.65 and HR, 2.52; 95% CI, 1.29-4.91 for ITA and IDI, respectively); however, there was no significant difference between the 2 intravitreal treatment groups.
CONCLUSIONS: Intravitreal triamcinolone acetonide and the IDI were superior to PTA for treating uveitic ME with modest increases in the risk of IOP elevation. This risk did not differ significantly between intravitreal treatments.",61,2019-Feb-1

There are few systematic studies on the natural history or immunogenetic associations of erythema nodosum (EN) or ocular inflammation in inflammatory bowel disease (IBD), but they are reportedly more common in patients with other extraintestinal manifestations (EIMs), particularly arthritis. Immunogenetic associations have previously been described in IBD arthritis and in EN associated with sarcoidosis. This study examined the clinical features and HLA-B, DR, and tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNF-alpha) associations of ocular inflammation and EN and their clinical and immunogenetic relationship to arthritis in IBD.
METHODS: Details of EN and ocular inflammation were gathered by case-note review and questionnaire in 976 ulcerative colitis patients and 483 Crohn's patients. Sequence-specific PCR typing for polymorphisms in HLA-B, DR, and TNF-alpha was performed in 39 EN and 40 ocular patients. Results were compared with 490 IBD controls without EIMs, 38 patients with type 1 and 31 with type 2 peripheral arthritis, and 16 AS patients.
RESULTS: EN and ocular inflammation were more common in women, were associated with IBD relapse, and recurred in approximately 30% of patients. They occurred more commonly with arthritis and AS than expected by chance. Ocular inflammation was strongly associated with HLA-B*27, B*58, and HLA-DRB1*0103. There is a weak association between EN and HLA-B*15 but a strong association with the -1031 TNF-alpha.
CONCLUSIONS: EN, uveitis, and arthritis associated with IBD occur together commonly. They are associated with genes in the HLA region, and linkage disequilibrium between these genes may account for the clinical picture of overlapping but independent clinical manifestations.",61,2002-Sep-1

PMID: 12719076
Pediatric uveitis is rare and has been reported to cause increased rates of visual loss compared with adult patients. The reasons for this are unclear. Only one study has been population-based, so the effect of referral bias is not known. We examined the pattern of disease in primary and referral centers to establish the unique characteristics of uveitis in children.
DESIGN: Case control study.
METHODS: Retrospective, multicenter, observational study of uveitis starting before the age of 20 years. Two hundred forty-nine patients were recruited from three primary and two referral ophthalmic units. Age-related differences in types of uveitis and systemic disease between hospitals were characterized, as were associations with visual loss.
RESULTS: The incidence of uveitis in district hospitals at less than 16 years of age was 4.9/100,000: the most frequent diagnosis was idiopathic uveitis (78%). In referral cohorts the most frequent diagnosis was juvenile idiopathic arthritis-associated uveitis (67%). Other systemic diseases were rare. The most frequent type of uveitis at 0 to 7 years of age was chronic anterior uveitis, posterior uveitis in 8- to 15-year-olds, and acute anterior uveitis in 16- to 19-year-olds. Visual loss (any eye < 6/12) occurred in 17% and was not associated with age, sex, or hospital cohort. It was most frequent in posterior uveitis (25%). Treatment variables were independent predictors of visual loss: systemic treatment 2.2 (1.1- 4.6), surgical intervention 8.2 (3.8-17.6).
CONCLUSIONS: Idiopathic uveitis was three times more common in district hospitals. Visual loss was similar to adult uveitis in this study. The increased frequency of severe chronic anterior uveitis in children aged 0 to 7 years and posterior uveitis in older children aged 8 to 15 years accounts for the rate of visual loss seen in previous studies.",59,2003-May-1

To assess polymerase chain reaction (PCR) analysis of intraocular fluid as a test for infectious uveitis of the posterior segment in a representative patient population.
DESIGN: Retrospective, interventional case series.
METHODS: One hundred and thirty-three patients with possible infectious chorioretinitis underwent PCR testing of aqueous or vitreous in a university setting. Baseline characteristics predictive of test positivity were identified. Positive and negative predictive values were calculated.
RESULTS: Four hundred and thirty-three PCR tests of 105 aqueous and 38 vitreous specimens (mean, 3.3 tests per patient) identified 77 of the 95 patients with a final clinical diagnosis of infectious uveitis (81%). Herpes simplex virus, varicella zoster virus, and cytomegalovirus PCR analysis were performed in almost all cases, with fewer tests for toxoplasmosis or Epstein-Barr virus. Clinical features associated with positive PCR results were retinal vascular inflammation (P < .001), optic nerve involvement (P = .008), immunocompromised state (P = .039), and extensive retinitis (P = .002). Cases sampled within one week of presentation were more likely to have positive PCR results than those sampled later (P = .071). The predictive value of positive and negative tests was 98.7% and 67.9%, respectively, in this patient group. Alteration in treatment based on PCR and syphilis serologic results led to resolution in 25 of 26 patients after treatment was changed.
CONCLUSIONS: PCR testing is a useful adjunct in the diagnosis of infectious causes of posterior uveitis. Cases with vascular or optic nerve inflammation, extensive retinitis, or immunocompromise are more likely to have positive PCR results and may benefit from PCR testing of aqueous humor.",59,2009-Jan-1

To evaluate the long-term clinical and functional outcome, risks, and causes of vision loss and burden of disease among patients with uveitis.
DESIGN: Cross-sectional study.
PARTICIPANTS: The study included 1076 patients diagnosed with uveitis who attended the uveitis clinic at Moorfields Eye Hospital, London, United Kingdom, between 2011 and 2013.
METHODS: Information was gathered from the notes of all patients who were examined in the clinic.
MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Best-corrected visual acuity (BCVA), causes of moderate vision loss (MVL; 20/50-20/120), and severe vision loss (SVL; ≤ 20/200).
RESULTS: The study included 1799 eyes of 1076 patients with an average follow-up of 7.97 ± 0.17 years (median, 5.6 years; range, 1 month-54 years; 8159 patient-years; 14 226 eye-years). Average BCVA remained stable for patients with anterior uveitis (20/30 at baseline to 20/33 at 10 years), as well as for those with nonanterior uveitis (20/50 at baseline to 20/47 at 10 years). Vision loss was noted in 19.2% of eyes, with an incidence for MVL of 0.01 per eye-year or 0.02 per patient-year and for SVL of 0.01 per eye-year or 0.02 per patient-year. Patients were more at risk of vision loss if they had non-anterior uveitis disease, vitreous opacities, retinal detachment, cystoid macular edema (CME), macular scarring, macular hole, optic neuropathy, or macular ischemia. Chronic CME was the most common cause of MVL (3.55%), and macular scarring was the most common cause for irreversible SVL (4%). Among 525 patients (48.7%) who received oral prednisolone, 320 (61%) required a dose of more than 40 mg/day and 130 (24.8%) also required 1 or more second-line agents. Patients were reviewed on average 33.7 ± 0.7 times or 5.9 ± 0.46 times/year.
CONCLUSIONS: Long-term functional outcome among uveitis patients is good, with BCVA remaining stable for more than 10 years of follow-up. In cases when vision loss occurs, it is related mainly to retinal changes. The burden on clinical services is similar regardless of the severity of disease or the risk of vision loss.",59,2014-Dec-1

The uveitides are a collection of more than 30 diseases characterized by intraocular inflammation. Many cases of juvenile idiopathic arthritis-associated uveitis, many cases of intermediate uveitis, and most cases of posterior and panuveitides requiring treatment are treated with corticosteroids and immunosuppression. Disease-specific, time-updated modeling of clinical data for several uveitides suggests superior prevention of ocular complications and visual outcomes with immunosuppression. These studies also suggest that oral corticosteroids at doses low enough for safe long-term therapy (i.e., <7.5 mg/day) are ineffective, implying that immunosuppression should be part of the initial regimen. The Multicenter Uveitis Steroid Treatment (MUST) Trial and Follow-up Study was a randomized comparative effectiveness trial comparing systemic therapy with oral corticosteroids and immunosuppression with regional corticosteroid treatment. It demonstrated that, when used properly, oral corticosteroids and immunosuppression can be given safely for up to 7 years with no evident increased risk of systemic side effects compared with regional corticosteroid therapy, except for greater antibiotic use for infections. The Systemic Treatment for Eye Diseases (SITE) Cohort Study suggested long-term safety for this approach, when the immunosuppressive agents were antimetabolites or calcineurin inhibitors. Thus, oral corticosteroids and immunosuppression may be a preferred initial therapy for many noninfectious, intermediate, posterior, and panuveitides. Nonalkylating-agent immunosuppression has a low rate of sustained, drug-free remissions, <10%/year. Nonalkylating-agent immunosuppression for >3 years with control of the inflammation for >2 years is associated with a decreased risk of relapse after discontinuing immunosuppression. Alkylating agents can induce sustained drug-free remissions but likely increase the lifetime risk of cancer. Biologics, which target specific cytokines and pathways, hold promise for the future. Monoclonal antibodies directed against tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-α have been studied most often, and one, adalimumab, is U.S. Food and Drug Administration approved for the treatment of noninfectious, intermediate, posterior, and panuveitides.",58,2018-Feb-1

To evaluate adalimumab therapy in refractory uveitis.
DESIGN: Prospective case series.
PARTICIPANTS: A total of 131 patients with refractory uveitis and intolerance or failure to respond to prednisone and at least 1 other systemic immunosuppressive drug participated.
INTERVENTION: Patients received a 40 mg adalimumab subcutaneous injection every other week for 6 months. The associated immunosuppressants were tapered after administering 3 adalimumab injections (week 6).
MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Degree of anterior and posterior chamber inflammation (Standardization of Uveitis Nomenclature Working Group criteria), immunosuppression load (as defined by Nussenblatt et al), visual acuity (logarithm of the minimal angle of resolution [logMAR]), and macular thickness (optical coherence tomography).
RESULTS: There were 61 men and 70 women (mean age, 27.3 years). The most common causes were juvenile idiopathic arthritis in 39 patients, pars planitis in 16 patients, and Behçet's disease in 13 patients. Twenty-seven patients had uveitis of idiopathic origin. Inflammation in the anterior chamber was present in 82% of patients and in the vitreous cavity in 59% of patients. Anterior chamber inflammation and vitreous inflammation decreased significantly (P < 0.001) from a mean of 1.51 and 1.03 at baseline to 0.25 and 0.14, respectively, at 6 months. Macular thickness was 296 (102) μ at baseline versus 240 (36) μ at the 6-month visit (P < 0.001). Visual acuity improved by -0.3 logMAR in 32 of 150 eyes (21.3%) and worsened by +0.3 logMAR (-15 letters) in 5 eyes (3.3%). The dose of corticosteroids also decreased from 0.74 (3.50) to 0.20 (0.57) mg/kg/day (P < 0.001). Cystoid macular edema, which was present in 40 eyes at baseline, showed complete resolution in 28 eyes at 6 months. The mean suppression load decreased significantly (8.81 [5.05] vs 5.40 [4.43]; P < 0.001). Six months after the initiation of the study, 111 patients (85%) were able to reduce at least 50% of their baseline immunosuppression load. Only 9 patients (6.9%) had severe relapses during the 6 months of follow-up.
CONCLUSIONS: Adalimumab seems to be well tolerated and helpful in decreasing inflammatory activity in refractory uveitis and may reduce steroid requirement. Further controlled studies of adalimumab for uveitis are warranted.",58,2012-Aug-1

The eye is the prototypic immune-privileged organ. Its antigens were once believed to be expressed exclusively in the eye, which resides behind an efficient blood-organ barrier, and were believed to be unknown to the immune system. Self-tolerance to ocular components was therefore believed to be based not on immune tolerance but on immune ignorance. It is now known that the relationship between the immune system and the eye is much more complex. On the one hand, immune privilege is now known to involve not only sequestration but also active mechanisms that (i) inhibit innate and adaptive immune processes within the eye and (ii) shape the response that develops systemically to antigens released from the eye. On the other hand, retinal antigens are found in the thymus and have been shown to shape the eye-specific T-cell repertoire. However, thymic elimination of self-reactive T cells is incomplete, and such 'escapee' T cells are tolerized in the periphery as they recirculate through the body by encounter with self-antigen in healthy tissues. Due to the relative inaccessibility of the healthy eye to the immune system, peripheral tolerance mechanisms may not operate efficiently for ocular antigens, leaving a weak link in the homeostasis of tolerance. The case shall be made that although immune privilege protects vision by keeping the immune system at bay, a potential for developing destructive anti-retinal autoimmunity may be the price for the day-to-day protection afforded by immune privilege against inflammatory insults.",57,2006-Oct-1

To investigate etiologic data on intraocular inflammation in Japan collected in the 2009 epidemiologic survey of uveitis in Japan and assess the current state of etiology compared with that reported in a previous survey.
METHODS: Thirty-six university hospitals participated in this prospective etiologic study. Patients who visited the outpatient uveitis clinic of each hospital for the first time between 1 June 2009 and 31 May 2010 were enrolled in the study. Uveitic diseases were diagnosed according to the guidelines when available or following commonly accepted diagnostic criteria.
RESULTS: A total of 3,830 patients were enrolled in the survey and 2,556 cases of uveitis were identified, of which 1,274 cases were described as unclassified intraocular inflammation. In the identified cases, the most frequent intraocular inflammatory disease was sarcoidosis (10.6 %), followed by Vogt-Koyanagi-Harada disease (7.0 %), acute anterior uveitis (6.5 %), scleritis (6.1 %), herpetic iridocyclitis (4.2 %), Behçet's disease (3.9 %), bacterial endophthalmitis (2.5 %), masquerade syndrome (2.5 %), Posner-Schlossman syndrome (1.8 %), and retinal vasculitis (1.6 %).
CONCLUSIONS: The current etiology of uveitis in Japan was elucidated by means of a multi-center prospective survey. Conducting such surveys on a periodic basis may help clinicians in their management of uveitis.",57,2012-Sep-1

Commensal microbes affect all aspects of immune development and homeostasis in health and disease. Increasing evidence points to the notion that the gut commensals impact not only intestinal diseases but also diseases in tissues distant from the gut. Autoimmune or non-infectious uveitis is a sight-threatening intraocular inflammation that affects the neuroretina. It is strongly T cell driven, but the precise causative mechanisms are not fully understood. We and others observed that depletion of gut microbiota in animal models of uveitis attenuated disease. Using a spontaneous model of the disease, we questioned how retina-specific uveitogenic T cells are primed when their cognate antigens are sequestered within the immune privileged eye. The data suggested that gut commensals provide a signal directly through the retina-specific T cell receptor and cause these autoreactive T cells to trigger uveitis. This activation of retina-specific T cells in the gut appears to be independent of the endogenous retinal antigen. Rather, the findings point to the notion that gut microbiota may mimic retinal antigen(s), however, the actual mimic has not yet been identified. Microbiota may also serve as an ""adjuvant"" providing innate signals that amplify and direct the host immune response for development of uveitis.

Uveitis is a general term for intraocular inflammation and includes a large number of clinical phenotypes. As a group of disorders, it is responsible for 10% of all registered blind patients under the age of 65 years. Immune-mediated uveitis may be associated with a systemic disease or may be localized to the eye. The pro-inflammatory cytokines interleukin (IL)-1beta, IL-2, IL-6, interferon-gamma and tumor necrosis factor-alpha have all been detected within the ocular fluids or tissues in the inflamed eye together with others, such as IL-4, IL-5, IL-10 and transforming growth factor-beta. The chemokines IL-8, monocyte chemoattractant protein-1, macrophage inflammatory protein (MIP)-1alpha, MIP-1beta and fractalkine are also thought to be involved in the associated inflammatory response. There have been a number of studies in recent years investigating cytokine profiles in different forms of uveitis with a view to determining what cytokines are important in the inflamed eye. This review attempts to present the current state of knowledge from in vitro and in vivo research on the inflammatory cytokines in intraocular inflammatory diseases.",56,2006-Dec-1

Immune-related ocular toxicities are uncommon but serious adverse events that may be associated with the use of immune checkpoint inhibitors. The objective of this review is to assess the incidence and risk of ocular toxicities which are potentially immune-related and occur with immune checkpoint treatment of solid tumors. Areas covered: PubMed database has been searched till June 2016. Prospective clinical trials reporting the occurrence of immune-related ocular toxicities in solid tumor patients treated with immune checkpoint inhibitors were included. Eleven trials with 4965 participants were included. These studies included one study for ipilimumab and tremelimumab, three studies for nivolumab, five studies for pembrolizumab and one study comparing pembrolizumab to ipilimumab. No atezolizumab studies were included. The most common ocular toxicities reported with these agents included uveitis and dry eyes. Pooled analysis for odds ratio of all-grade immune-related ocular toxicities is 3.40 [95% CI: 1.32-8.71; P = 0.01]. Expert commentary: Despite being uncommon, immune-related ocular toxicities (particularly uveitis and dry eyes) occur with a higher frequency in cancer patients treated immune checkpoint inhibitors compared to those treated with control regimens.",55,2017-Apr-1

The purpose of this study was to determine whether anti-tumour necrosis factor alpha (anti-TNF-α) antibody, infliximab, can inhibit T helper 17 (Th17) differentiation in uveitis patients who have Behçet's disease (BD).
METHODS: To measure inflammatory cytokines, ocular fluid samples from BD patients being treated with infliximab were collected. Cluster of differentiation 4 (CD4)+ T cells from BD patients with active uveitis were co-cultured with anti-cluster of differentiation 3/cluster of differentiation 28 (CD3/CD28) antibodies in the presence of infliximab. For the induction of Th17 cells, CD4+ T cells from BD patients were co-cultured with anti-CD3/CD28, anti-interferon-gamma (anti-IFN-γ), anti-interleukin-4 (anti-IL-4), and recombinant proteins such as interleukin-1 beta (IL-1β), interleukin-6 (IL-6), interleukin-23 (IL-23), and TNF-α. The BD T cells were co-cultured with infliximab, and the production of interleukin-17 (IL-17) was evaluated by ELISA and flow cytometry, and the expression of retinoid-acid receptor-related orphan receptor gamma t (RORγt) was also evaluated by flow cytometry. In addition, intraocular cells collected from mice with experimental autoimmune uveitis (EAU) were used for the assay with anti-TNF-α blocking antibody.
RESULTS: Ocular fluids from active uveitis patients who have BD contained significant amounts of inflammatory cytokines such as IFN-γ, IL-2, TNF-α, IL-6, and IL-17, while ocular fluids from infliximab patients did not contain any inflammatory cytokines. Activated CD4+ T cells from BD patients produced large amounts of TNF-α and IL-17, whereas T cells in the presence of infliximab failed to produce these cytokines. Polarized Th17 cell lines from BD patients produced large amounts of IL-17, and Th17 cells exposed to infliximab had significantly reduced IL-17 production. Polarized BD Th17 cells expressed large amounts of transcription factor RORγt. In contrast, in vitro-treated infliximab Th17 cells expressed less RORγt. Moreover, intraocular T cells from EAU mice had a high population of IL-17+ cells, and retinal antigen-specific T cells from EAU mice produced large amounts of IL-17 in the presence of retinal peptide. However, the EAU T cells produced less IL-17 if the T cells were treated with anti-TNF-α antibody.
CONCLUSIONS: These results indicate that anti-TNF-α therapy suppresses effector T-cell differentiation in BD patients with uveitis. Thus, suppression of effector T-cell differentiation by anti-TNF-α therapy may provide protection from severe ocular inflammation in BD.",55,2012-May-01

To investigate the retinal neural damage that occurs during inflammation and the therapeutic effects of the angiotensin II type 1 receptor (AT1R) blocker, telmisartan, using a model of endotoxin-induced uveitis (EIU).
METHODS: The localization of AT1R and AT2R was shown by immunohistochemistry. EIU was induced by intraperitoneal injection of lipopolysaccharide (LPS). Animals were treated with telmisartan for 2 days and were evaluated 24 hours later. Expression levels of angiotensin II, STAT3 activation induced by inflammatory cytokines, and retinal proteins essential for neural activities (e.g., synaptophysin, rhodopsin) were analyzed by immunoblot. An AT2R antagonist was administered to evaluate the contribution of AT2R signaling in this therapy. Dark-adapted full-field electroretinography (ERG) was also performed.
RESULTS: AT1R and AT2R were expressed in presynaptic terminals in most of the retinal neurons. AT1R was also expressed in Müller glial cells. During inflammation, angiotensin II expression was elevated, STAT3 was activated, and synaptophysin and rhodopsin expression were reduced. The expression of glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP), downstream of STAT3 activation, was induced in Müller glial cells. However, treatment with telmisartan successfully avoided all these changes. An AT2R antagonist lowered synaptophysin expression despite the treatment. STAT3 activity was negatively correlated with rhodopsin expression. Furthermore, ERG responses, which were mostly prevented by telmisartan, were disturbed during inflammation.
CONCLUSIONS: Retinal protein expression and visual function are both disturbed by inflammation. Treatment with the AT1R blocker telmisartan efficiently prevented these signs of retinal neural damage through the reduction of local angiotensin II expression, the blockade of AT1R, and the relative upregulation of AT2R function.",55,2006-Dec-1

To analyze demographics, anatomic data, diagnoses, systemic associations, and visual outcomes of pediatric patients in a large tertiary eye center.
DESIGN: Retrospective cohort study.
METHODS: The records of 1242 patients with uveitis referred to the Ocular Immunology and Uveitis Service of the Massachusetts Eye and Ear Infirmary (MEEI) from 1985 to 2003 were reviewed retrospectively. Two hundred sixty-nine patients 16 years and younger were identified.
RESULTS: Among 269 children with uveitis, 53.5% were girls, 82% were Caucasian, and 82% were born in the United States. Mean age was 8 years (standard deviation, 3.8; range, 1-16). Anterior uveitis represented 56.9% of cases; intermediate, 20.8%; panuveitis, 16%; and posterior, 6.3%. Nongranulomatous (77.6%) and noninfectious (85.7%) were the most frequent types of inflammation. The process was bilateral in 74.4% of patients. Mean follow-up was 22 months, with mean age of 8 years at diagnosis. Mean duration of uveitis at the time of presentation at the MEEI was 2 years. The range of time between the diagnosis of uveitis and referral was 1 day to 5.6 years. The length of time between diagnosis of uveitis and the referral to the tertiary center strongly correlated with the complication rate and degree of visual impairment in our study. The longer the time before the patients were seen by the uveitis expert, the worse the visual outcomes. No systemic associations were found in 58% of patients, juvenile idiopathic arthritis was responsible for 33% of cases, 8% of patients had other systemic associations, and 1% had tubulointerstitial nephritis uveitis syndrome.
CONCLUSIONS: Uveitis remains a serious cause of morbidity and visual loss in children. Timely referral to uveitis specialists in the tertiary referral centers may lead to improved visual outcomes in children with chronic uveitis.",55,2005-Jul-1

Uveitis and retinal vasculitis are sight-threatening manifestations of Behçet's disease with limited treatment options. This pilot study aimed to evaluate the safety, pharmacokinetics and clinical activity of XOMA 052 (gevokizumab), a recombinant humanised anti-interleukin 1β antibody, in Behçet's disease patients with uveitis.
METHODS: Patients with acute posterior or panuveitis, and/or retinal vasculitis, resistant to azathioprine and/or ciclosporin, and receiving 10 mg/day or less of prednisolone, were enrolled into the 98-day study. Immunosuppressive agents were discontinued at baseline. Patients received a single infusion of XOMA 052 (0.3 mg/kg). The safety and uveitis status and pharmacokinetics of XOMA 052 were evaluated.
RESULTS: Seven patients enrolled and completed the study. No treatment-related adverse event was observed. XOMA 052 treatment was associated with rapid and durable clinical response in all patients. Complete resolution of intraocular inflammation was achieved in 4-21 days (median 14 days), with a median duration of response of 49 days (range 21-97 days); one patient remained exacerbation free throughout the study.
CONCLUSIONS: Well tolerated, XOMA 052 resulted in a rapid onset and sustained reduction in intraocular inflammation in patients with resistant uveitis and retinal vasculitis. Moreover, the effect was observed despite discontinuation of immunosuppressive agents and without the need to increase corticosteroid dosages.",55,2012-Apr-1

To investigate the effect of infliximab on the frequency of uveitis attacks and the visual prognosis in male patients with Behçet's disease in whom uveitis was resistant to combination therapy with corticosteroids, azathioprine, and cyclosporine.
METHODS: The study group comprised patients who were receiving combination therapy but experienced at least 2 attacks of posterior uveitis/panuveitis or retinal vasculitis during the 6-month period prior to enrollment. Infliximab infusions (5 mg/kg) were administered at weeks 0, 2, 6, and 14. Weeks 0-22 were defined as the infusion period, and weeks 23-54 were defined as the observation period. Patients continued to receive azathioprine and corticosteroids, but cyclosporine was discontinued after the screening visit. The primary outcome measures were the absence of uveitis attacks during the infusion period (remission), and the absence of uveitis attacks throughout the study period (sustained remission).
RESULTS: Thirteen patients were enrolled in the study. Thirty-two uveitis attacks involving the posterior segment occurred during the previous-treatment period. During the infusion period, 4 patients (30.8%) remained attack-free, and 9 patients had a total of 13 uveitis attacks. Ten of these attacks (76.9%) occurred at either week 14 or week 22. One of 13 patients fulfilled the definition of sustained remission, and the remaining 12 patients had a total of 36 uveitis attacks during the observation period. The mean number of uveitis attacks and daily corticosteroid doses were significantly lower during the infusion period than during the previous-treatment period or the observation period. Although potential visual acuity was regained following infliximab infusion, this beneficial effect was not preserved until week 54. None of the patients experienced a serious adverse event.
CONCLUSION: The results of this trial suggest that infliximab is effective in suppressing the occurrence of uveitis attacks, has a corticosteroid-sparing effect, and has favorable implications for the visual prognosis of patients with resistant Behçet's uveitis.",55,2005-Aug-1

Short chain fatty acids (SCFA) are metabolites of intestinal bacteria resulting from fermentation of dietary fiber. SCFA are protective in various animal models of inflammatory disease. We investigated the effects of exogenous administration of SFCAs, particularly propionate, on uveitis using an inducible model of experimental autoimmune uveitis (EAU). Oral SCFA administration attenuated uveitis severity in a mouse strain-dependent manner through regulatory T cell induction among lymphocytes in the intestinal lamina propria (LPL) and cervical lymph nodes (CLN). SCFA also suppressed effector T cell induction in the CLN and mesenteric lymph nodes (MLN). Alterations in intestinal morphology and gene expression demonstrated in the EAU model prior to the onset of uveitis were blunted by oral SCFA administration. Using a Kaede transgenic mouse, we demonstrated enhanced leukocyte trafficking between the intestine and the eye in EAU. Propionate suppressed T effector cell migration between the intestine and the spleen in EAU Kaede mice. In conclusion, our findings support exogenous administration of SCFAs as a potential treatment strategy for uveitis through the stabilization of subclinical intestinal alterations that occur in inflammatory diseases including uveitis, as well as prevention of trafficking of leukocytes between the gastrointestinal tract and extra-intestinal tissues.",55,2017-Sep-18

To review the pathogenesis of uveitis in light of recent advances in our understanding of innate and adaptive immune responses and their regulation.
DESIGN: Perspective.
METHODS: Methods included a review of prevailing views on the pathogenesis of uveitis and an analysis of developments in immunology that impact on its conceptual basis, particularly the concept of immunologic tolerance and its loss in autoimmunity. Importantly, the role of infection in the pathogenesis of uveitis is evaluated.
RESULTS: The results comprise a reappraisal of the pathogenesis of anterior vs posterior uveitis in the context of the blood-retinal barrier and its relation to autoimmune, autoinflammatory, and infectious uveitis. Autoimmunity is seen as a possible cause of certain forms of uveitis but definitive proof is lacking. Autoinflammatory disease, involving activated innate immune mechanisms, is considered causative in a second set of uveitis conditions. A place for infection in uveitis generally is proposed within a unifying concept for the pathogenesis of uveitis.
CONCLUSION: Infection may be implicated directly or indirectly in many forms of noninfectious or undifferentiated uveitis. In addition to the growing recognition that foreign antigen, including reactivatable infectious agents, might hide within ocular tissues, the possibility that a dysregulated microbiome might generate T cells that cause immune-mediated ocular inflammation has now been demonstrated experimentally. An uncontrolled, overexuberant host immune response may cause continuing irreversible tissue damage even after the infection has been cleared.",55,2018-May-1

Injection of pharmacotherapy into the suprachoroidal space, between the sclera and choroid, is an alternative delivery technique developed with the rationale of providing higher drug concentrations to posterior ocular structures compared with other intraocular and periocular injection procedures. This study was conducted to evaluate the safety and efficacy of suprachoroidally injected triamcinolone acetonide formulation (CLS-TA), a suspension of triamcinolone acetonide, in improving vision among patients with noninfectious uveitis complicated by macular edema (ME).
DESIGN: Phase 3 masked, randomized trial.
PARTICIPANTS: One hundred sixty patients with ME secondary to noninfectious uveitis. Patients were required to have a best-corrected visual acuity (BCVA) of 5 or more Early Treatment Diabetic Retinopathy Study (ETDRS) letters (Snellen equivalent, 20/800) and 70 or fewer ETDRS letters read (Snellen equivalent, 20/40) in the study eye.
METHODS: Patients were randomized 3:2 to suprachoroidally injected CLS-TA or sham treatment, with administrations at day 0 and week 12.
MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: The primary end point was improvement from baseline of 15 or more ETDRS letters in BCVA at week 24. The secondary end point was reduction from baseline in central subfield thickness (CST) at week 24.
RESULTS: In the CLS-TA arm, 47% of patients gained 15 or more ETDRS letters in BCVA versus 16% in the control arm (P < 0.001), meeting the primary end point. Mean reductions in CST from baseline were 153 μm versus 18 μm (P < 0.001). No serious adverse events (AEs) related to treatment were reported. Corticosteroid-associated AEs of elevated intraocular pressure occurred in 11.5% and 15.6% of the CLS-TA and control groups, respectively. Cataract AE rates were comparable (7.3% and 6.3%, respectively).
CONCLUSIONS: Patients in the CLS-TA study arm experienced clinically significant improvement in vision relative to the sham procedure, demonstrating the efficacy of suprachoroidal injection of CLS-TA for the treatment of ME in a vision-threatening disorder.",54,2020-Jul-1

To provide population-based data on the risk, types, and outcomes of eye involvement in herpes zoster (HZ).
METHODS: A cohort study based on review of the medical records of patients in whom HZ was diagnosed between January 1, 1980, and December 31, 2007, was performed. Herpes zoster was confirmed by the presence of the typical rash and symptoms or by laboratory testing, and eye involvement was confirmed by ophthalmologists' evaluation. Information was collected on all eye diagnoses and on HZ eye-related visits, treatments, procedures, and outcomes.
RESULTS: Of the 2035 individuals with HZ in any dermatome, 184 (9.0%) had eye involvement. The mean age of the 184 was 62.6 years, and 5 cases occurred in patients younger than 21. Overall, 6.5% (12) were immunosuppressed at the time of the eye complications. The rate of increase in HZ eye involvement was 23% by decade from 1980 to 2007. Common eye complications were keratitis (n=144, 76.2%), uveitis/iritis (n=88, 46.6%), and conjunctivitis (n=67, 35.4%). Recurrent keratitis and recurrent iritis/uveitis occurred in 6.9% (13) and 7.4% (14), respectively. Outcomes included 6 patients (3.3%) with new vision decrements to 20/200 or worse. Two individuals had successful corneal transplants. Another 6 individuals (3.3%) had lid ptosis that affected vision, including 1 elderly woman with permanent unilateral tarsorrhaphy. Severe HZ eye pain was reported to be directly responsible for 1 unsuccessful suicide attempt. Acute retinal necrosis did not develop in any individual. A mean of 10.8 eye visits per patient with HZ and eye involvement was reported to continue for a mean of 308 days.
CONCLUSION: Eye complications are common and result in considerable health care use and permanent vision decrement in about 6.6% (6) of individuals with HZ eye involvement. Most health care use and long-term adverse outcomes occurred in patients in whom prevention of HZ with the zoster vaccine would be possible.",53,2013-Jun-1

To measure the genomic DNA of ocular infectious pathogens in ocular fluids and to analyze the clinical relevance of these pathogens in uveitis and endophthalmitis.
DESIGN: Prospective clinical case series.
PARTICIPANTS: A total of 500 patients with infectious uveitis and endophthalmitis were examined at Tokyo Medical and Dental University, Tokyo Medical University, Kyushu University, Osaka University, and Kyoto Prefectural University, all in Japan.
METHODS: Genomic DNA of bacteria, fungi, parasites, and viruses in collected intraocular samples were examined by comprehensive polymerase chain reaction (PCR). Samples were analyzed first by multiplex PCR and quantitative real-time PCR for human herpes viruses (HHVs) 1 through 8 and toxoplasma. Subsequently, samples were examined by broad-range real-time PCR for bacterial 16S and fungal 18S/28S ribosomal DNA (rDNA).
MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Infectious uveitis and endophthalmitis diagnoses were obtained when using the PCR system. Calculations of the positivity and the diagnostic parameters such as sensitivity, specificity, positive predictive value (PPV), and negative predictive value (NPV) also were evaluated.
RESULTS: In all of the tested infectious uveitis and endophthalmitis patients, either herpes simplex virus type 1 (n = 18), herpes simplex virus type 2 (n = 4), varicella-zoster virus (n = 55), Epstein-Barr virus (n = 17), cytomegalovirus (n = 68), HHV type 6 (n = 2), toxoplasma (n = 6), bacterial 16S (n = 33), or fungal 18S/28S (n = 11) genome was detected. Neither HHV type 7 nor HHV type 8 DNA was detected in any of the samples. Of the 21 false-negative results found during the PCR analyses, 12 cases were negative for patients clinically suspected of having bacterial endophthalmitis. Conversely, false-positive results for the comprehensive PCR examinations occurred in only 3 cases that subsequently were found to have bacterial 16S rDNA. Diagnostic parameters for the sensitivity, specificity, PPV, and NPV of our PCR examinations were 91.3%, 98.8%, 98.6%, and 92.4%, respectively.
CONCLUSIONS: Use of our comprehensive PCR assay to examine ocular samples in patients with endophthalmitis and uveitis seems to be clinically useful for detecting infectious antigen DNA. Thus, this PCR method is a reliable tool for both diagnosing ocular disorders and further screening of patients for intraocular infections.

Extraintestinal manifestations of inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) occur in one third of patients. Ocular complications are infrequent, occurring in less than 10% of cases, but can be associated with significant morbidity, including blindness. Ocular complaints are often nonspecific; clinical relevance may not be appreciated by patient or physician and, thus, be misdiagnosed. Evaluation of the eye should be a routine component in the care of patients with IBD. Clinicians must be aware of the spectrum of ocular symptoms and know that these complaints may precede a diagnosis of ulcerative colitis (UC) or Crohn's disease (CD). We review ocular pathology in IBD to alert clinicians to the diverse, at times confusing, spectrum of eye disorders associated with these diseases. Clinical manifestations include blurred vision, teary, burning or itchy eyes, ocular pain, photophobia, conjunctival or scleral hyperemia, loss of visual acuity, and possible blindness. Many patients are unaware that IBD has a risk of eye complications and, therefore, patient education is vital.",53,2004-Mar-1

To report the pattern of uveitis in a north Indian tertiary eye center.
METHODS: A retrospective study was done to identify the pattern of uveitis in a uveitis clinic population of a major referral center in north India from January 1996 to June 2001. A standard clinical protocol, the ""naming and meshing"" approach with tailored laboratory investigations, was used for the final diagnosis.
RESULTS: 1233 patients were included in the study; 641 (51.98%) were males and 592 (48.01%) females ranging in age from 1.5 to 75 years. The anterior uveitis was seen in 607 patients (49.23%) followed by posterior uveitis (247 patients, 20.23 %), intermediate uveitis (198 patients, 16.06%) and panuveitis (181 patients, 14.68%). A specific diagnosis could be established in 602 patients (48.82%). The infective aetiology was seen in 179 patients, of which tuberculosis was the commonest cause in 125 patients followed by toxoplasmosis (21 patients, 11.7%). Non-infectious aetiology was seen in 423 patients, of which ankylosing spondylitis was the commonest cause in 80 patients followed by sepigionous choroidopathy (62 patients, 14.65%).
CONCLUSION: Tuberculosis and toxoplasmosis were the commonest form of infective uveitis, while ankylosing spondylitis and serpiginous choroidopathy were commonly seen as the non-infective causes of uveitis in North India.",53,2004-Jun-1

To investigate the use of intravitreal injection of triamcinolone acetonide (TA) for the treatment of refractory uveitic cystoid macular edema (CME).
DESIGN: Prospective, nonrandomized, self-controlled comparative trial.
PARTICIPANTS: Six patients with chronic CME resistant to treatment with systemic steroids, orbital floor steroids, and cyclosporine A. Three patients were followed for more than 1 year, and the other three for between 3 and 9 months.
INTERVENTION: Injection of 2 mg of TA into the vitreous cavity.
TESTING: Optical coherence tomography scanning of the fovea before and after injection and logarithmic minimal angle of resolution visual acuity.
MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Visual acuity, retinal thickness, cystoid space height, and intraocular pressure.
RESULTS: There was complete anatomic resolution of CME in five of the six cases within 1 week after injection. Cystoid spaces began to return between 6 weeks and 3 months after injection. Two patients with longer term follow-up responded to further orbital floor steroid injection and had no CME 1 year later. One patient had raised intraocular pressure develop, requiring a trabeculectomy. Mean improvement in visual acuity after 12 months was 0.27 (range, 0.14-0.42).
CONCLUSIONS: Complete anatomic and, to some extent, functional recovery can be induced by intravitreal TA despite long-term refractory inflammatory CME. Optical coherence tomography aids in the management of these cases.",53,2001-Apr-1

During the early phase of experimental autoimmune uveitis (EAU), before macrophages infiltrate the retina and uvea, photoreceptor mitochondrial oxidative stress, nitration of photoreceptor mitochondrial proteins, and release of cytochrome c have been observed. However, no apoptosis has been detected during this phase. In this study, alphaA-crystallin upregulation in the retina and its antiapoptotic protective role were evaluated in early EAU.
METHODS: Gene microarrays were first used to identify upregulated genes in retinas with early EAU. Among highly upregulated crystallins, alphaA was confirmed by real-time polymerase chain reaction and Western blot, and the site of upregulation was localized by immunohistochemistry. The association of alphaA-crystallin to nitrated cytochrome c and interaction with a procaspase-3 subunit was assayed. Photoreceptor apoptosis in alphaA knockout mice was compared with that in wild-type animals with EAU, by using the terminal transferase dUTP nick-end labeling assay and polymerase chain reaction.
RESULTS: In early EAU, alphaA-crystallin was increased 33-fold, and the site of increase was localized to the photoreceptor inner segments. This crystallin suppressed apoptosis by associating with the nitrated cytochrome c and p24. The association with nitrated cytochrome c, in particular, appeared to be restricted to nitrated cytochrome c, and thus, no association of non-nitrated cytochrome c was detected. The knockout mice showed signs of EAU development early and showed apoptosis in the retina; no such changes were seen in the wild-type control animals.
CONCLUSIONS: alphaA-Crystallin is highly upregulated in the retina during early EAU. This upregulation is localized primarily in the photoreceptor inner segments, the site of mitochondrial oxidative stress. Further, in early EAU, the photoreceptors preferentially use alphaA-crystallin to suppress mitochondrial oxidative stress-mediated apoptosis.",53,2008-Mar-1

Since its introduction in the early 1990s, optical coherence tomography (OCT) has evolved in resolution and technological advances, and in recent years its initial application of assessing the morphology of a tissue has been implemented by the study of its functional blood flow, through optical coherence tomography angiography (OCTA). This novel technique details capillary networks by comparing the amount of light returned from static and moving targets without the need for intravenous dye administration. While this imaging modality has been used for various ocular conditions, the application OCTA to uveitis conditions remains sparse. This review aims to establish the basis of OCTA and its current application to ocular inflammatory disorders, with an emphasis on monitoring progression and response to treatment, as well as predicting visual complications. In particular, this review explores the use of OCTA in iris vessel dilation seen in various forms of iritis, as a predictive factor for further episodes of inflammation. OCTA can also depict ischemia in the deep plexus layers of the retina and identify true choroicapillaris ischemia in cases of placoid diseases or masking of the indocyanine green dye, as in multiple evanescent white dot syndrome. In addition, OCTA can depict neovascularization in granulomatous disease of the retina or choroid not previously depicted with previous imaging methods. While OCTA provides several advancements in the imaging, management and prognosis of uveitis diseases, we emphasize that further studies are required to fully understand its application to these conditions.",53,2017-Jul-1

To investigate the manifestations and severity of uveitis in children and to identify the risk and specific causes of blindness in this population.
METHODS: Retrospective study of data of 123 consecutive patients examined with active uveitis and the onset of ocular disease before the age of 16 years. Numerous variables were assessed including age and sex distribution, laboratory data, the presence of systemic diseases, onset and course of ocular inflammation, clinical features and complications, therapeutic strategies and their outcomes, final visual acuity, and characteristics associated with poor visual outcome.
RESULTS: Systemic disease was observed in 36/123 patients (29%), with juvenile idiopathic arthritis being the most frequent (25/123, 20%). Toxoplasma retinochoroiditis was diagnosed in 12/23 patients with posterior uveitis (52%; 10% of all with uveitis). Severe intraocular inflammation required systemic drugs in 57 (46%) patients. Ocular complications were observed in 93 patients (76%), of which the most common was cataract (43/123, 35%). Intraocular surgery was required in 35 patients (28%; in total 75 procedures). Three patients (2%) became legally blind and an additional 20/121 (17%) had one legally blind eye caused by uveitis. The most frequent causes of blindness were chorioretinal scars in the macular area and glaucoma in contrast with cystoid macular oedema (CMO) in adults.
CONCLUSIONS: Uveitis in childhood is a potentially blinding disease, in the majority of patients characterised by a chronic course and a high complication rate.",52,2003-Jul-1

Oral administration of uveitogenic retinal antigens suppresses the expression of EAU induced by a subsequent immunization with these antigens. Effectiveness and mechanisms of oral tolerance in EAU have mainly been studied in the acute, monophasic model in Lewis rats by feeding antigen prior to induction of disease. In this study we investigated the effect of oral tolerance induction in the acute as well as the chronic-relapsing models in the B10.A mouse. In acute murine EAU we could effectively suppress disease by induction of oral tolerance prior to immunization. In the chronic-relapsing EAU, antigen feeding was started only after the animals had recovered from their first attack of uveitis. Under these experimental conditions the subsequent relapse was largely prevented. These experiments demonstrate that oral tolerance may have practical clinical implications in uveitis, which is predominantly a chronic-relapsing condition in humans.",51,1997-Aug-1

To report baseline articular, functional and ocular findings of the first international prospective cohort study of Blau syndrome (BS).
METHODS: Three-year, multicentre, observational study on articular, functional (HAQ, Childhood HAQ and VAS global and pain), ophthalmological, therapeutic and radiological data in BS patients.
RESULTS: Baseline data on the first 31 recruited patients (12 females and 19 males) from 18 centres in 11 countries are presented. Of the 31 patients, 11 carried the p.R334W NOD2 mutation, 9 the p.R334Q and 11 various other NOD2 missense mutations; 20 patients were sporadic and 11 from five BS pedigrees. Median disease duration was 12.8 years (1.1-57). Arthritis, documented in all but one patient, was oligoarticular in 7, polyarticular in 23. The median active joint count was 21. Functional capacity was normal in 41%, mildly impaired in 31% and moderate-severe in 28% of patients. The most frequently involved joints at presentation were wrists, ankles, knees and PIPs. On radiographs, a symmetrical non-erosive arthropathy was shown. Previously unknown dysplastic bony changes were found in two-thirds of patients. Ocular disease was documented in 25 of 31 patients, with vitreous inflammation in 64% and moderate-severe visual loss in 33%. Expanded manifestations (visceral, vascular) beyond the classic clinical triad were seen in 52%.
CONCLUSION: BS is associated with severe ocular and articular morbidity. Visceral involvement is common and may be life-threatening. Bone dysplastic changes may show diagnostic value and suggest a previously unknown role of NOD2 in bone morphogenesis. BS is resistant to current drugs, suggesting the need for novel targeted therapies.",51,2015-Jun-1

Mesenchymal stem/progenitor cells (MSCs) have regenerative and immunomodulatory properties, exerted by cell-cell contact and in a paracrine fashion. Part of their immunosuppressive activity has been ascribed to their ability to promote the induction of CD4+CD25+FoxP3+ T lymphocytes with regulatory functions (Treg). Here the authors studied the effect of MSCs on the induction of Treg and on the development of autoimmunity, and they examined the possibility that MSC-mediated Treg induction could be attributed to the secretion of soluble factors.
METHODS: The authors induced experimental autoimmune uveitis (EAU) in mice by immunization with the 1-20 peptide of the intraphotoreceptor binding protein. At the same time, some of the animals were treated intraperitoneally with syngeneic MSCs. The authors checked T-cell responses and in vitro Treg conversion by cell proliferation and blocking assays, in cell-cell contact and transwell settings. TGFβ and TGFβ receptor gene expression analyses were performed by real-time PCR.
RESULTS: The authors found that a single intraperitoneal injection of MSCs was able to significantly attenuate EAU and that a significantly higher percentage of adaptive Treg was present in MSC-treated mice than in MSC-untreated animals. In vitro blocking of antigen presentation by major histocompatibility complex class II precluded priming and clonal expansion of antigen-specific Treg, whereas blockade of TGFβ impaired the expression of FoxP3, preventing the conversion of CD4+ T cells into functionally active Treg.
CONCLUSIONS: The authors demonstrated that MSCs can inhibit EAU and that their immunomodulatory function is due at least in part to the induction of antigen-specific Treg in a paracrine fashion by secreting TGFβ.",50,2012-Feb-1

To compare the efficacy and safety of adalimumab versus infliximab in an open-label prospective, comparative, multicenter cohort study of childhood noninfectious chronic uveitis.
METHODS: Thirty-three patients (22 females, 11 males, median age 9.17 years) with refractory, vision-threatening, noninfectious active uveitis were enrolled, and received for at least 1 year infliximab (5 mg/kg at weeks 0, 2, and 6, and then every 6-8 weeks) or adalimumab (24 mg/m2 every 2 weeks). The primary outcome was to assess, once remission was achieved, the time of a first relapse. Time to remission, time to steroid discontinuation, and the number of relapses were also considered.
RESULTS: Sixteen children (12 with juvenile idiopathic arthritis [JIA], 3 with idiopathic uveitis, and 1 with Behçet's disease) were recruited in the adalimumab cohort and 17 children (10 with JIA, 5 with idiopathic uveitis, 1 with early-onset sarcoidosis, and 1 with Behçet's disease) were recruited in the infliximab group. Cox regression analysis did not show statistically significant differences between the two groups with regard to time to achieve remission and time to steroid discontinuation, whereas a higher probability of uveitis remission on adalimumab during the time of treatment was shown (Mantel-Cox χ2=6.83, P<0.001). At 40 months of followup, 9 (60%) of 15 children receiving adalimumab compared to 3 (18.8%) of 16 children receiving infliximab were still in remission on therapy (P<0.02).
CONCLUSION: Even if limited to a relatively small group, our study suggests that over 3 years of treatment, adalimumab is more efficacious than infliximab in maintaining remission of chronic childhood uveitis.",50,2011-Apr-1

Hyperactivity of the renin-angiotensin system (RAS) resulting in elevated Angiotensin II (Ang II) contributes to all stages of inflammatory responses including ocular inflammation. The discovery of angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) has established a protective axis of RAS involving ACE2/Ang-(1-7)/Mas that counteracts the proinflammatory and hypertrophic effects of the deleterious ACE/AngII/AT1R axis. Here we investigated the hypothesis that enhancing the systemic and local activity of the protective axis of the RAS by oral delivery of ACE2 and Ang-(1-7) bioencapsulated in plant cells would confer protection against ocular inflammation. Both ACE2 and Ang-(1-7), fused with the non-toxic cholera toxin subunit B (CTB) were expressed in plant chloroplasts. Increased levels of ACE2 and Ang-(1-7) were observed in circulation and retina after oral administration of CTB-ACE2 and Ang-(1-7) expressing plant cells. Oral feeding of mice with bioencapsulated ACE2/Ang-(1-7) significantly reduced endotoxin-induced uveitis (EIU) in mice. Treatment with bioencapsulated ACE2/Ang-(1-7) also dramatically decreased cellular infiltration, retinal vasculitis, damage and folding in experimental autoimmune uveoretinitis (EAU). Thus, enhancing the protective axis of RAS by oral delivery of ACE2/Ang-(1-7) bioencapsulated in plant cells provide an innovative, highly efficient and cost-effective therapeutic strategy for ocular inflammatory diseases.",49,2014-Dec-1

To describe the morphologic characteristics of uveitic macular edema by the use of optical coherence tomography (OCT) and to investigate the correlation between tomographic features and visual acuity (VA).
DESIGN: Cross-sectional study.
PARTICIPANTS: Seventy consecutive patients with uveitis in a university-based practice with a clinical diagnosis of macular edema in at least one eye. Inclusion criteria were: (1) verification of macular edema by OCT, (2) adequate media clarity for fundus visualization, and (3) absence of coexisting ocular disease limiting visual potential.
METHODS: Complete ophthalmic examination: best-corrected Snellen VA, slit-lamp examination, fundus biomicroscopy, indirect ophthalmoscopy, and OCT. Fluorescein angiography was performed in selected cases.
MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Best-corrected Snellen VA and tomographic features of the macula, including macular thickness measurement and correlation of macular thickness with VA.
RESULTS: Eighty-four eyes of 60 patients met the inclusion criteria. The mean VA (Snellen test) was 20/36. There were 3 patterns of macular edema: diffuse macular edema (DME), cystoid macular edema (CME), and serous retinal detachment (RD). Serous retinal detachment was detected in 17 eyes (20.2%). Patients were classified into the following groups: DME (46 eyes, 54.8%), CME (21 eyes, 25%), DME and RD (5 eyes, 5.9%), CME and RD (12 eyes, 14.3%). Epiretinal membrane was detected by OCT in 34 eyes (40.5%). Eight eyes (9.5%) demonstrated vitreomacular traction. The mean retinal thickness at the central fovea was 333+/-171 microm (mean +/- standard deviation). Macular edema was located mainly in the outer retinal layers. Eyes with CME had significantly greater retinal thickness measurements than eyes with DME (P<0.001). Multivariate analysis revealed that VA was negatively correlated with increased macular thickness, presence of CME, and RD (P<0.05).
CONCLUSIONS: Optical coherence tomography demonstrated 3 patterns of macular edema in patients with uveitis: DME, CME, and RD. Epiretinal membrane coexisted in a significant percentage of patients. In patients with uveitis with clear media, the morphologic features of macular edema and macular thickness correlated with VA.",48,2004-May-1

To evaluate the reproducibility of new criteria for grading the site and activity of intraocular inflammation.
DESIGN: Cross-sectional agreement study.
METHODS: Grading of 202 eyes of 101 patients with uveitis was conducted by pairs of uveitis subspecialists at three uveitis subspecialty clinics. Agreement in grading location of inflammation, anterior chamber (AC) cells, AC flare, vitreous cells (present or absent), and vitreous haze was calculated.
RESULTS: Proposed criteria for grading the location of intraocular inflammation had moderate reproducibility (kappa range, 0.49 to 0.61). Reproducibility improved (kappa range, 0.61 to 0.73) when the newly proposed category of anterior and intermediate uveitis was excluded. The ranges of kappa statistics for exact agreement on gradings of AC cells (range, 0.34 to 0.43) demonstrated low to moderate levels of agreement, and gradings of AC flare (range, 0.50 to 0.64), vitreous cells (range, 0.48 to 0.51), and vitreous haze (0.53) were in the moderate agreement range. However, agreement within 1 grade was outstanding for AC cells (kappa range, 0.81 to 1.00) and vitreous haze (kappa, 0.75). For AC flare, a distribution skewed toward low grades within 1 grade made kappa statistics unstable.
CONCLUSIONS: Proposed methods for grading inflammatory activity have moderate reproducibility for exact agreement in most instances. However, agreement within 1 grade is excellent for grading of AC cells and vitreous haze. The method for grading the site of intraocular inflammation also produces moderate levels of agreement, and in our hands was improved by excluding both anterior and intermediate uveitis. Improved methods for grading AC flare and vitreous cells are needed.",47,2008-Dec-1

Uveitis in children most commonly is associated with juvenile idiopathic arthritis. In addition to topical glucocorticoids, treatment may include systemic immunosuppressive agents. Tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNF-alpha) has been implicated in the pathogenesis of uveitis; therefore, TNF-alpha blockade seems to be a reasonable therapeutic option to investigate. We report successful treatment of children with uveitis using infliximab.
STUDY DESIGN: A retrospective study of our complete experience using infliximab for the treatment of childhood uveitis was conducted.
PARTICIPANTS: Seventeen children (14 females, 3 males) with chronic uveitis were administered high-dose infliximab (10-20 mg/kg/dose).
MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Our main outcome measure was the ability to eliminate all signs of intraocular inflammation.
RESULTS: All 17 patients demonstrated a dramatic, rapid response, with no observed inflammation in 13 patients after the second infusion, and 4 patients requiring 3 to 7 infusions to achieve disease quiescence. Additional immunosuppressives and topical glucocorticoids were tapered when patients achieved no intraocular inflammation.
CONCLUSIONS: In this series, high-dose infliximab was a rapidly effective, well-tolerated therapeutic agent for the treatment of chronic, medically refractory, noninfectious uveitis.",47,2006-May-1

METHODS: Retrospective retrieval of data on a computerized database incorporating all new referrals to MUC from 1991 to 2013.
RESULTS: A total of 3000 new patients with uveitis were seen during a 22-year period. The anatomical types seen were anterior 46%; intermediate 11.1%; posterior 21.8%; and panuveitis 21.1%. The most common diagnoses were Fuchs heterochromic uveitis (11.5% of total), sarcoidosis-related uveitis (9.7%), idiopathic intermediate uveitis (7.9%), idiopathic acute anterior uveitis (7.0%), and toxoplasmosis (6.9%). Syphilis and tuberculosis-associated uveitis increased markedly in frequency during the study period.
CONCLUSIONS: The uveitis casemix in this region reflects a predominantly white Caucasian population in a temperate country, but with changing characteristics owing to increasing immigration, enhanced diagnostic techniques, changes in referral pattern, and some real changes in disease incidence.",47,2015-Apr-1

Juvenile idiopathic arthritis (JIA) is the most common rheumatic disease of childhood, with JIA-associated uveitis its most common extra-articular manifestation. JIA-associated uveitis is a potentially sight-threatening condition and thus carries a considerable risk of morbidity. The aetiology of the condition is autoimmune in nature with the predominant involvement of CD4(+) T cells. However, the underlying pathogenic mechanisms remain unclear, particularly regarding interplay between genetic and environmental factors. JIA-associated uveitis comes in several forms, but the most common presentation is of the chronic anterior uveitis type. This condition is usually asymptomatic and thus screening for JIA-associated uveitis in at-risk patients is paramount. Early detection and treatment aims to stop inflammation and prevent the development of complications leading to visual loss, which can occur due to both active disease and burden of disease treatment. Visually disabling complications of JIA-associated uveitis include cataracts, glaucoma, band keratopathy and macular oedema. There is a growing body of evidence for the early introduction of systemic immunosuppressive therapies in order to reduce topical and systemic glucocorticoid use. This includes more traditional treatments, such as methotrexate, as well as newer biological therapies. This review highlights the epidemiology of JIA-associated uveitis, the underlying pathogenesis and how affected patients may present. The current guidelines and criteria for screening, diagnosis and monitoring are discussed along with approaches to management.",47,2016-Apr-27

The British Ocular Syphilis Study (BOSS) is the first national prospective epidemiological study of intraocular syphilis (IOS) in light of the global increase in early syphilis (ES). The aims were to ascertain the UK incidence, demographics, clinical features, laboratory data, and posttreatment visual outcomes of patients with IOS.
METHODS: Prospective study of IOS, reported through the national reporting system (British Ocular Surveillance Unit) from 2009 to 2011. Case definition was any adult presenting with intraocular inflammation in ES.
RESULTS: A total of 41 new cases (63 eyes) of IOS were reported, giving an annual incidence of 0.3 per million UK adult population. Mean age was 48.7 years (range, 20.6-75.1); 90.2% were male. All had RPR/VDRL titers of ≥1:16. Bilateral ocular involvement occurred in 56%; in unilateral cases, the left eye was more commonly affected (P = 0.009). Mean presenting logMAR visual acuity was 0.52 (20/63 Snellen; range, -0.2 to 2.30 logMAR). Panuveitis was the commonest diagnosis, seen in 41.3%, and isolated anterior uveitis was uncommon (9.5%). Subgroup analysis between HIV-positive and -negative patients found no significant differences in terms of proportion of bilateral disease, presenting or post treatment acuity. HIV-positive patients had higher rates of panuveitis. At final follow-up, 92.1% had visual acuity ≥ 0.3 logMAR (20/40 Snellen) after antibiotic therapy.
CONCLUSIONS: This study is the largest prospective series of ocular syphilis in the post-penicillin era. It confirms good visual outcomes for treated IOS, irrespective of HIV status or time to presentation. The study identified an unexpected preponderance for left eye involvement in uniocular cases; which is unexplained.",47,2014-Jun-12

To measure the visual functioning and quality of life in patients with uveitis.
METHODS: Consecutive adult patients with noninfectious uveitis were enrolled. The Medical Outcomes Study 36-Item Short Form (SF-36) and the National Eye Institute Visual Functioning Questionnaire (NEI VFQ-25) were administered by a trained interviewer. Sociodemographic and clinical data were also collected.
RESULTS: Seventy-six patients were enrolled. The overall NEI VFQ-25 score was significantly lower among patients with uveitis than in a normal reference group (P<.001). The SF-36 physical (PCS) and mental (MCS) component summary scores were also significantly lower among patients with uveitis than in the general US population (P<.007). Among patients with uveitis, visual acuity, binocular involvement, intensity of therapy, employment status, and PCS and MCS scores were all significantly associated with overall NEI VFQ-25 scores in multivariable analysis. Medical comorbidity, ocular comorbidity, and NEI VFQ-25 scores were significantly associated with PCS scores. Medical comorbidity and NEI VFQ-25 scores were significantly associated with MCS scores. Regression models including NEI VFQ-25 scores explained an additional 7% of the variance in PCS scores and 16% of MCS scores. Models including both PCS and MCS scores explained an additional 12% of the variance in NEI VFQ-25 scores.
CONCLUSIONS: Patients with uveitis reported markedly poorer visual functioning and general health status than normal subjects. Patients with more severe uveitis have poorer visual functioning and general health status than patients with milder disease. Visual functioning and general health status measurement contribute complementary information and should both be performed in patients with uveitis to measure the effect of disease and its therapy on their quality of life.",46,2001-Jun-1

Although spontaneous remissions often occur in sarcoidosis, chronic persistent disabling disease is also observed. Of a series of 183 patients with chronic sarcoidosis, 47 (26%) had ophthalmic involvement. In this series, chronic sarcoid was defined as disease for a minimum of five years. Patients were followed primarily for their systemic disease for a mean of 13 years. Uveitis developed in 35 patients (19%) and was an early manifestation in 32 (91%). The course of the ocular disease did not necessarily parallel that of the systemic disease. Despite the chronic nature of the underlying disease, the anterior uveitis did not pursue a chronic course in 15 of 33 patients (45%) and was generally characterized by a single episode at the onset of disease. Chronic uveitis and secondary glaucoma were poor prognostic signs, as eight of 11 patients with uveitis and glaucoma suffered severe visual loss.",46,1986-Sep-15

To report the frequency and trend of intraocular inflammation based on a survey of new ophthalmology patient visits to university hospitals throughout Japan during 2002.
METHODS: A questionnaire was sent to the departments of ophthalmology in 110 university hospitals nationwide to survey the total number of new patients who visited the outpatient clinics for the first time between 1 January and 31 December 2002, and also the number of patients diagnosed with intraocular inflammation during this period.
RESULTS: The surveys completed by 41 university hospitals were analyzed in this study. During 2002, a total of 151 299 new ophthalmological patients presented at the 41 institutions, and 3060 (2.2%) of the new patients were diagnosed as having intraocular inflammation. The most frequent intraocular inflammatory disease identified was sarcoidosis (13.3%), followed by Vogt-Koyanagi-Harada (VKH) disease (6.7%), Behçet disease (6.2%), bacterial endophthalmitis (3.8%), herpetic iridocyclitis (3.6%), diabetic iritis (1.6%), human leukocyte antigen-B27-associated uveitis (1.5%), acute retinal necrosis (1.3%), ocular toxoplasmosis (1.1%), ocular toxocariasis (1.1%), uveitis associated with human T lymphotropic virus-1 (also known as HAU) (1.1%), and others. Infectious intraocular inflammation accounted for 16% of all uveitis cases.
CONCLUSIONS: Through the collaboration of a large number of institutions, some aspects of the epidemiology of intraocular inflammation in Japan were elucidated. However, the disease concept and diagnostic criteria remain ambiguous for a considerable number of diseases within the spectrum of intraocular inflammation, and the possibility that such factors may bias the present findings cannot be denied. In the future, a prospective survey based on well-defined, common diagnostic criteria is required to obtain more precise epidemiological data.",46,2007-1-1

Uveitis is a vision-threatening inflammation and is considered an ophthalmic emergency. It generally arises as a result of autoimmune conditions, infections, or ocular trauma, but it may also occur as an isolated disorder. Over the past decades, several cases of vaccine-associated uveitis have been described, with the hepatitis B virus vaccine being the leading cause.
CLINICAL CASE: A case of anterior uveitis in a 23-year-old male, with onset 14 days after the second dose of BNT162b2 COVID-19 vaccine, is reported here. Initial symptoms were pain, photophobia, and red eye. Ocular examination showed pericheratic and conjunctival hyperaemia, posterior synechiae, and anterior chamber cells ± keratic precipitates in the lower quadrants. The posterior segment did not show any alteration, and optical coherence tomography ruled out the presence of cystoid macular oedema. After a 10-day treatment course of topical steroids and cycloplegic eye drops, the ocular inflammatory signs disappeared and visual acuity was completely restored. Even if causality remains presumed, a warning should be given to physicians about the possibility of eye inflammation following SARS-CoV-2 vaccination.",46,2021-Sep-1

To examine the occurrence and characteristics of uveitis in patients with recently diagnosed juvenile chronic arthritis (JCA).
DESIGN: A prospective observational case series.
PARTICIPANTS/METHODS: The study covered the new cases detected with JCA (426 children), all of whom were referred to an ophthalmologic consultation during 1989 to 1996 at the Pediatric Department of the Rheumatism Foundation Hospital, Heinola, Finland.
MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: The children with JCA were followed by ophthalmologic and pediatric examinations two to four times a year. The type and course of arthritis and presentation and characteristics of uveitis were examined prospectively.
RESULTS: Uveitis was detected in 104 of 426 children (24%). Two thirds of all patients and the same proportion of those with uveitis were girls. Proportionally, uveitis was found to be as common among children with oligoarthritis (27%) as among those with seronegative polyarthritis (25%). Antinuclear antibodies (ANA) were detected significantly more frequently in patients with uveitis (66%) than among those without uveitis (37%) (P < 0.001). The uveitis was asymptomatic in 99 cases; only 5 children had episodes of acute anterior symptomatic uveitis. Uveitis was found before or within 3 months from the onset of recent arthritis in 51 of 104 children (49%) and later on in 53 of 104 children (51%). The mean age at diagnosis of uveitis was 5.9 years (range, 1.1-17.7; median, 4.9 years). The mean period from the diagnosis of JCA to the diagnosis of uveitis was 1.1 years (range, -2.4-6.5; median, 0.3 years). The mean age at diagnosis of JCA was 4.8 years (range, 0.6-15; median, 3.2 years) among those with uveitis and 7.3 years (range, 0.9-16; median, 6.7 years) among those who did not have it (P < 0.001). Uveitis was ongoing in 63 children at the end of the follow-up period. The mean follow-up time was 4.5 years (range, 0-9.7) for all children and 5.6 years (range, 1.3-9.6) for those with uveitis. In most instances, the visual prognosis was good. In 25 of 104 patients (24%) one or more complications of uveitis were found, but in only three children did the visual acuity decrease to 20/60 or less, and none became blind. All the other patients had visual acuity > or = 20/40.
CONCLUSIONS: In this patient group, uveitis in JCA frequently appeared very early after the onset of arthritis. The uveitis was significantly more common in patients with an early onset of arthritis combined with ANA positivity. The proportion of children with uveitis was as large in those with polyarthritis as in those with oligoarthritis, with no predilection to girls.",45,2001-Nov-1

This review summarizes the current evidence for biologic therapies in the treatment of uveitis. The review emphasizes published research in this field since 2005.
RECENT FINDINGS: The anti-tumour necrosis factor-alpha infliximab and adalimumab have demonstrated significant efficacy in controlling uveitis associated with seronegative spondyloarthropathies and juvenile idiopathic arthritis; however, etanercept has failed to show a similar treatment effect in uveitis associated with these conditions. The majority of reports of biologic therapies in posterior uveitis have been uncontrolled trials, or retrospective studies, of uveitis resistant to immunosuppression. Encouragingly, successful control of such refractory intraocular inflammation has been consistently reported with infliximab and interferon alpha, particularly Behcet's disease-associated uveitis. A limited number of reports of anti-interleukin therapies, daclizumab and anakinra, have supported a role for these therapies in some types of uveitis.
SUMMARY: Biologic therapies have increased the treatment options for sight-threatening uveitis. Despite experimental rationale, the lack of evidence from randomized controlled studies limits our understanding of when to commence therapy, which agent to choose and how long to continue treatment. Additionally, the high cost and potential side effects of all biologic agents have limited their current use to uveitis refractory to immunosuppression.",45,2007-Nov-1

There is a paucity of data on extraintestinal manifestations (EIM) and their treatment in pediatric patients with inflammatory bowel disease (IBD).
METHODS: Since 2008, the Pediatric Swiss IBD Cohort Study has collected data on the pediatric IBD population in Switzerland. Data on 329 patients were analyzed retrospectively.
RESULTS: A total of 55 patients (16.7%) experienced 1-4 EIM (39 Crohn disease, 12 ulcerative colitis, and 4 IBD-unclassified patients). At IBD onset, presence of EIM was more frequent than in the adult population (8.5% vs 5.0%, P = 0.014). EIM were more frequent in Crohn disease when compared to ulcerative colitis/IBD-unclassified (22.5% vs 10.3%, P = 0.003). The most prevalent EIM were peripheral arthritis (26/329, 7.9%) and aphthous stomatitis (24/329, 7.3%). Approximately 27.6% of all EIM appeared before IBD diagnosis. Median time between IBD diagnosis and occurrence of first EIM was 1 month (-37.5-149.0). Thirty-one of the 55 patients (56.4%) were treated with 1 or more anti-tumor necrosis factor (TNF) agents. IBD patients with EIM were more likely to be treated with anti-TNF compared to those without (56.4% vs 35.0%, P = 0.003). Response rates to anti-TNF depended on underlying EIM and were best for peripheral arthritis (61.5%) and uveitis (66.7%).
CONCLUSIONS: In a cohort of pediatric patients with IBD, EIM were frequently encountered. In up to 30%, EIM appeared before IBD diagnosis. Knowledge of these findings may translate into an increased awareness of underlying IBD, thereby decreasing diagnostic delay. Anti-TNF for the treatment of certain EIM is effective, although a substantial proportion of new EIM may present despite ongoing anti-TNF therapy.",45,2017-Aug-1

To determine the frequency of occurrence of limited clinical features which distinguish patients with Vogt-Koyanagi-Harada (VKH) disease from those with non-VKH uveitis.
DESIGN: Comparative case series.
PARTICIPANTS: We included 1147 patients.
METHODS: All patients with bilateral ocular inflammatory disease presenting to any of 10 uveitis centers in the 3-month period between January 1 and March 31, 2006 (inclusive), were asked to participate. The clinical and historical features of disease were obtained from the participants via direct interview and chart review. Patients were stratified based on whether they were diagnosed with VKH disease or non-VKH uveitis for statistical analysis.
MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Presence or absence of various clinical features in the 2 populations.
RESULTS: Of 1147 patients, 180 were diagnosed with VKH disease and 967 with non-VKH uveitis. Hispanics and Asians were more likely to be diagnosed with VKH than non-VKH disease compared with other ethnicities. In acute disease, the finding of exudative retinal detachment was most likely to be found in VKH disease with a positive predictive value (PPV) of 100 and negative predictive value (NPV) of 88.4, whereas in chronic disease, sunset glow fundus was most likely to be found, with a PPV of 94.5 and NPV of 89.2.
CONCLUSIONS: Numerous clinical findings have been described in the past as important in the diagnosis of VKH. The current study reveals that of these, 2 are highly specific to this entity in an ethnically and geographically diverse group of patients with nontraumatic bilateral uveitis. These clinical findings are exudative retinal detachment during acute disease and sunset glow fundus during the chronic phase of the disease.",45,2010-Mar-1

Serpiginous choroiditis (SC) is a posterior uveitis displaying a geographic pattern of choroiditis, extending from the juxtapapillary choroid and intermittently spreading centrifugally. The choroiditis involves the overlying retinal pigment epithelium, and the outer retina. This intraocular inflammation typically involves both eyes in otherwise healthy, middle-aged individuals with no familial or ethnic predilection. Pathogenesis is unclear; based on limited histopathologic studies, however, favorable response to immunosuppressive agents, and the absence of association with systemic or local infectious or noninfectious diseases, an organ-specific autoimmune inflammation seems likely to be the underlying process. Patients, particularly from tuberculosis-endemic regions, may present with fundus changes simulating SC, but show evidence of active tuberculosis and/or the presence of mycobacterial DNA in the aqueous humor. This has been referred to as serpiginous-like choroiditis, but we prefer the description multifocal serpiginoid choroiditis (MSC). We present the distinguishing features of SC and infectious multifocal serpiginoid choroiditis simulating SC. The distinction is crucial to avoid unnecessarily treating SC with antimicrobial agents. Advances in diagnostic and imaging modalities can help differentiate SC from MSC. Novel local and systemic treatment approaches improve the outcome and preserve vision in SC.",45,2013-1-1

Juvenile idiopathic arthritis (JIA) is the most common systemic disease associated with uveitis in childhood. The frequency of JIA-associated uveitis (JIAU) varies geographically, and between ethnicities. Uveitis risk is high in JIA associated with oligoarthritis, young age at arthritis onset and ANA positivity. Gender alters risk for the incidence of JIA and the severity of JIAU. Familial cases support the possible role of genetic influences in the pathogenesis. Arthritis typically precedes the uveitis, but uveitis may occur up to seven years following the arthritis onset. Although complications still occur, the frequency of bilateral blindness has dropped, probably by both improved screening of high-risk patients with JIA, and the increased use of early immunosuppression. However, there is still continuing persistence of JIAU into adulthood. For improvement of epidemiological knowledge of this complicated disease, large, well-defined, long-term population-based registries are needed with the application of universally agreed case definitions and outcome measures.",44,2013-Jun-1

Since the first reported use in 2001 of an anti-tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-α) agent, infliximab, for the treatment of uveitis, several new anti-TNF-α agents have emerged for the treatment of refractory noninfectious uveitides, although their use remains off-label in the US. These agents have demonstrated remarkable clinical antiinflammatory efficacy and a potential immunoregulatory role in selected uveitis patients, but it is currently unclear whether they can modify the natural history of disease. We review the rationale and clinical indications for this therapy, the differences between agents, how to manage dosing and intervals, and how to screen for and identify potential side effects. We also present a summary of the science behind the use of anti-TNF-α agents in ocular inflammation and the evidence for their efficacy.",44,2015-1-1

Studies on the epidemiology of uveitis are rare and cohorts are small. We analyzed the frequencies of classified forms of uveitis in all patients at our center.
METHODS: We studied 1916 consecutive patients with inflammatory eye disease. Data were analyzed regarding associated systemic disease, infection, ocular syndromes, anatomic localization, age, and sex.
RESULTS: In 59.1% of patients, a classified form of uveitis was observed: associated systemic diseases in 43.7%, the most frequent ones sarcoidosis (17.4%) and ankylosing spondylitis (16.8%); ocular syndromes in 34.3%, the most frequent HLA-B27-positive anterior uveitis (AU; 35.1%) and Fuchs uveitis syndrome (FUS; 34.3%); and infections in 22.4%, the most frequent herpetic infections (46.1%) and toxoplasmosis (31.5%). We found AU in 45.4% of patients (15.4% HLA-B27-positive AU and 11.3% FUS), intermediate uveitis in 22.9% (unclassified 53.7% and multiple sclerosis 10.3%), and posterior uveitis in 13.5% (24.7% toxoplasmosis). Panuveitis was diagnosed in 6.2% of cases (Behçet's disease 12.6%; sarcoidosis 10.9%). The remaining 12.0% of cases showed extrauveal manifestations (scleritis, episcleritis, keratitis, optic neuritis, myositis, and orbital inflammation).
CONCLUSION: We describe the largest cohort to date of consecutive patients from a specialized uveitis center. The high frequency of classified disease, nearly 60% in our clinic, shows the usefulness of an interdisciplinary approach, oriented on anatomic presentation.",44,2009-Jan-1

In the normal eye, the complement system is continuously activated at low levels and both membrane-bound and soluble intraocular complement regulatory proteins tightly regulate this spontaneous complement activation. This allows protection against pathogens without causing any damage to self-tissue and vision loss. The complement system and complement regulatory proteins control the intraocular inflammation in autoimmune uveitis and play an important role in the development of corneal inflammation, age-related macular degeneration and diabetic retinopathy. The evidence derived from both animal models and patient studies support the concept that complement inhibition is a relevant therapeutic target in the treatment of various ocular diseases. Currently, several clinical trials using complement inhibitors are going on. It is possible that, in the near future, complement inhibitors might be used as therapeutic agents in eye clinics.",44,2007-Sep-1

To evaluate the benefits and complications of periocular depot corticosteroid injections in patients with ocular inflammatory disorders.
DESIGN: Multicenter, retrospective cohort study.
PARTICIPANTS: A total of 914 patients (1192 eyes) who had received ≥ 1 periocular corticosteroid injection at 5 tertiary uveitis clinics in the United States.
METHODS: Patients were identified from the Systemic Immunosuppressive Therapy for Eye Diseases Cohort Study. Demographic and clinical characteristics were obtained at every visit via medical record review by trained reviewers.
MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Control of inflammation, improvement of visual acuity (VA) to ≥ 20/40, improvement of VA loss attributed to macular edema (ME), incident cataract affecting VA, cataract surgery, ocular hypertension, and glaucoma surgery.
RESULTS: Among 914 patients (1192 eyes) who received ≥ 1 periocular injection during follow-up, 286 (31.3%) were classified as having anterior uveitis, 303 (33.3%) as intermediate uveitis, and 324 (35.4%) as posterior or panuveitis. Cumulatively by ≤ 6 months, 72.7% (95% CI, 69.1-76.3) of the eyes achieved complete control of inflammation and 49.7% (95% CI, 45.5-54.1) showed an improvement in VA from <20/40 to ≥ 20/40. Among the subset with VA <20/40 attributed to ME, 33.1% (95% CI, 25.2-42.7) improved to ≥ 20/40. By 12 months, the cumulative incidence of ≥ 1 visits with an intraocular pressure of ≥ 24 mmHg and ≥ 30 mmHg was 34.0% (95% CI, 24.8-45.4) and 15.0% (95% CI, 11.8-19.1) respectively; glaucoma surgery was performed in 2.4% of eyes (95% CI, 1.4-3.9). Within 12 months, among phakic eyes initially ≥ 20/40, the incidence of a reduction in VA to <20/40 attributed to cataract was 20.2% (95% CI, 15.9-25.6); cataract surgery was performed within 12 months in 13.8% of the initially phakic eyes (95% CI, 11.1-17.2).
CONCLUSIONS: Periocular injections were effective in treating active intraocular inflammation and in improving reduced VA attributed to ME in a majority of patients. The response pattern was similar across anatomic locations of uveitis. Overall, VA improved in one half of the patients at some point within 6 months. However, cataract and ocular hypertension occurred in a substantial minority.",44,2014-Nov-1

The aim of the present study was to investigate the effects of blue honeysuckle extract (BHE), which contains high level of phenolic compounds, on endotoxin-induced uveitis (EIU). Male Lewis rats were randomly divided into 5 groups with 14 rats in each (eight rats for collection of aqueous humor, six rats for histologic examination). EIU was induced by a footpad injection of lipopolysaccharide (LPS). 1, 10, or 100 mg of BHE was injected intravenously immediately after LPS injection. The aqueous humor was collected at 24 h after LPS injection, the number of infiltrating cells, protein concentration, nitric oxide (NO), tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-alpha, and prostaglandin (PG)-E2 levels in the aqueous humor were determined. Some eyes were enucleated for histologic examination and immunohistochemical analysis. Immunohistochemical staining with a monoclonal antibody against activated nuclear factor (NF)-kappaB was performed to evaluate the effect of BHE on NF-kappaB activation. To further clarify the anti-inflammatory effect, RAW264.7 cells (a mouse macrophage cell line) were stimulated with LPS in the presence or absence of BHE and its major phenolics, cyanidin 3-glucoside (C3G), cyanidin 3-rutinoside (C3R), chlorogenic acid (CA). Expression of inducible NO synthase (iNOS) and cyclooxygenase-2 (COX-2) were analyzed by Western blot method. BHE treatment significantly reduced the inflammatory cell infiltration, the protein concentration, the levels of NO, TNF-alpha and PGE2 in the aqueous humor and improved histologic status of the ocular tissue. The number of activated NF-kappaB-positive cells was lower in the iris-ciliary body treated with BHE at 3 h after LPS injection. BHE significantly suppressed the production of NO, PGE2 and TNF-alpha in the culture medium as well as the expression of iNOS and COX-2 by LPS-stimulated RAW264.7 cells in a dose-dependent fashion. C3G, C3R and CA showed no or weak inhibitory effects on the level of inflammatory mediators and the expression of iNOS and COX-2. These results suggest that BHE attenuates the degree of inflammation in eyes with EIU by inhibiting the NF-kappaB dependent signaling pathway and the subsequent production of proinflammatory mediators.",44,2006-May-1

Behcet's disease (BD) specific peptide (p336-351) was identified within the human 60 kD heat shock protein (HSP60). Oral p336-351 induced uveitis in rats which was prevented by oral tolerization with the peptide linked to recombinant cholera toxin B subunit (CTB). This strategy was adopted in a phase I/II clinical trial by oral administration of p336-351-CTB, 3 times weekly, followed by gradual withdrawal of all immunosuppressive drugs used to control the disease in 8 patients with BD. The patients were monitored by clinical and ophthalmological examination, as well as extensive immunological investigations. Oral administration of p336-351-CTB had no adverse effect and withdrawal of the immunosuppressive drugs showed no relapse of uveitis in 5 of 8 patients or 5 of 6 selected patients who were free of disease activity prior to initiating the tolerization regimen. After tolerization was discontinued, 3 of 5 patients remained free of relapsing uveitis for 10-18 months after cessation of all treatment. Control of uveitis and extra-ocular manifestations of BD was associated with a lack of peptide-specific CD4+ T cell proliferation, a decrease in expression of TH1 type cells (CCR5, CXCR3), IFN-gamma and TNF-alpha production, CCR7+ T cells and costimulatory molecules (CD40 and CD28), as compared with an increase in these parameters in patients in whom uveitis had relapsed. The efficacy of oral peptide-CTB tolerization will need to be confirmed in a phase III trial, but this novel strategy in humans might be applicable generally to autoimmune diseases in which specific antigens have been identified.",43,2004-Jul-1

Uveitis is a common cause of vision loss. The renin angiotensin system (RAS), which plays a vital role in cardiovascular system, is a potent mediator of inflammation and has been implicated in the pathogenesis of uveitis. A newly identified axis of RAS, ACE2/Ang-(1-7)/Mas, has emerged as a novel target because it counteracts the deleterious effect of angiotensin II. The purpose of this study was to investigate the effect of endogenous ACE2 activation in preventing endotoxin-induced uveitis (EIU) in mice.
METHODS: ACE2 activator diminazene aceturate (DIZE) was administered both systemically and locally. For systemic administration, female BALB/c mice received intraperitoneal injection of DIZE (60 mg/kg body weight [BW]) for 2 days prior to lipopolysaccharide (LPS) intravitreal injection (125 ng) to induce uveitis. For local study, DIZE was given at 0.5, 0.1, and 0 mg/mL as eyedrops six times per day for 2 days before LPS injection. The anterior segment of the mice was examined at 12, 24, 48, and 72 hours after LPS injection, and clinical scores were determined at the same time. Morphology and infiltrating inflammatory cells were evaluated after 24 hours. The mRNA levels of inflammatory cytokines were analyzed by real-time RT-PCR. ACE2 activity was determined using a self-quenching fluorescent substrate.
RESULTS: At 24 hours, the clinical score of mice treated with DIZE systemically was significantly lower (mean, ∼1.75) than the saline vehicle group (mean, ∼4) (P < 0.001). Histological examination showed 63.4% reduction of infiltrating inflammatory cells in the anterior segment and 57.4% reduction in the posterior segment of DIZE-treated eyes. The number of CD45(+) inflammatory cells in the vitreous of the DIZE-treated group was decreased (43.3%) compared to the vehicle group (P < 0.01). The mRNA levels of inflammatory cytokines were significantly reduced in the DIZE-treated group (P < 0.01, P < 0.001). The number of infiltrating inflammatory cells was also significantly reduced in eyes that received topical administration of DIZE: 73.8% reduction in the 0.5 mg/mL group and 51.7% reduction in the 0.1mg/mL group compared to the control group. DIZE treatment resulted in significantly increased ACE2 activity in the retina (P < 0.001).
CONCLUSIONS: Endogenous ACE2 activation by DIZE has a preventive effect on LPS-induced ocular inflammation in the EIU mouse model. These results support the notions that RAS plays a role in modulating ocular immune response and that enhancing ACE2 provides a novel therapeutic strategy for uveitis.",43,2014-May-22

To report on the clinical response to canakinumab in a patient with sporadic nucleotide-binding oligomerization domain-containing protein 2 (NOD-2)-associated pediatric granulomatous arthritis (Blau syndrome) and severe resistant panuveitis, and to describe gene expression profile changes throughout such treatment.
METHODS: A 4-year-old boy was diagnosed as having Blau syndrome on the basis of typical clinical features, histologic evidence of noncaseating granulomas, and a NOD2 mutation. Ocular involvement was initially controlled by topical and oral corticosteroids, but over the years visual impairment and complications, such as macular edema and retinal detachment, progressed. Ocular disease remained persistently active despite treatment with multiple different immunosuppressants; therefore, canakinumab treatment was started. Before and during the first 6 months of treatment, the gene expression profile was determined each month.
RESULTS: Canakinumab treatment was well tolerated and led to rapid quiescence of uveitis, which had been continuously active before this treatment. Gene expression profiling analysis of the patient's blood prior to initiation of interleukin-1 (IL-1) blockade revealed differential expression of 1,993 transcripts when compared to healthy controls, and among the up-regulated transcripts, pathway analysis showed that the predominant network consisted of innate immunity-related transcripts. The transcriptional signature of the patient overlapped with the transcriptional signature of patients with systemic-onset juvenile idiopathic arthritis, and canakinumab treatment led to the normalization of most of these transcriptional changes.
CONCLUSION: The pathogenesis of Blau syndrome may be mediated by IL-1, and canakinumab may be useful when this disorder is unresponsive to more conventional treatments.",43,2013-Feb-1

To analyse the pattern of uveitis in a referral centre in Tunisia, North Africa.
METHODS: The study included 472 patients with uveitis examined at the Department of Ophthalmology of Monastir (Tunisia) from January 1992 to August 2003. All patients had a comprehensive ocular and systemic history, including an extensive review of medical systems. Complete ophthalmic examination was performed in all cases, including best-corrected Snellen visual acuity, slit-lamp examination, applanation tonometry, and dilated fundus examination with three-mirror lens. Standard diagnostic criteria were employed for all syndromes or entities of uveitis.
RESULTS: The mean age at onset of uveitis was 34 years. The male-to-female ratio was 1:1.1. Uveitis was unilateral in 282 patients (59.7%) and bilateral in 190 patients (40.3%). Anterior uveitis was most common (166 patients; 35.2%), followed by posterior uveitis (133 patients; 28.2%), panuveitis (100 patients; 21.2%), and intermediate uveitis (73 patients; 15.5%). A specific diagnosis was found in 306 patients (64.8%). The most common cause of anterior uveitis was herpetic uveitis (56 patients; 33.7%). Toxoplasmosis was the most frequent cause of posterior uveitis (51 patients; 38.3%). Intermediate uveitis was most commonly idiopathic (63 patients; 86.3%). Behçet's disease was the most common cause of panuveitis (36 patients; 36%), followed by Vogt-Koyanagi-Harada (VKH) disease (15 patients; 15%). A total of 16 patients (3.4%) suffered from blindness, and 59 (12.5%) from uniocular blindness.
CONCLUSIONS: In a hospital population in Tunisia, the most common causes of uveitis were Behçet's disease, herpes simplex infection, toxoplasmosis, and VKH disease.",43,2007-Jan-1

To analyze the factors associated with response to anti-tumor necrosis factor (anti-TNF) treatment and compare the efficacy and safety of infliximab (IFX) and adalimumab (ADA) in patients with refractory noninfectious uveitis.
METHODS: This was a multicenter observational study of 160 patients (39% men and 61% women; median age 31 years [interquartile range 21-42]) with uveitis that had been refractory to other therapies, who were treated with anti-TNF (IFX 5 mg/kg at weeks 0, 2, 6, and then every 5-6 weeks [n = 98] or ADA 40 mg every 2 weeks [n = 62]). Factors associated with complete response were assessed by multivariate analysis. Efficacy and safety of IFX versus ADA were compared using a propensity score approach with baseline characteristics taken into account. Subdistribution hazard ratios (SHRs) and 95% confidence intervals (95% CIs) were calculated.
RESULTS: The main etiologies of uveitis included Behçet's disease (BD) (36%), juvenile idiopathic arthritis (22%), spondyloarthropathy (10%), and sarcoidosis (6%). The overall response rate at 6 and 12 months was 87% (26% with complete response) and 93% (28% with complete response), respectively. The median time to complete response was 2 months. In multivariate analysis, BD and occurrence of >5 uveitis flares before anti-TNF initiation were associated with complete response to anti-TNF (SHR 2.52 [95% CI 1.35-4.71], P = 0.004 and SHR 1.97 [95% CI 1.02-3.84], P = 0.045, respectively). Side effects were reported in 28% of patients, including serious adverse events in 13%. IFX and ADA did not differ significantly in terms of occurrence of complete response (SHR 0.65 [95% CI 0.25-1.71], P = 0.39), serious side effects (SHR 0.22 [95% CI 0.04-1.25], P = 0.089), or event-free survival (SHR 0.55 [95% CI 0.28-1.08], P = 0.083).
CONCLUSION: Anti-TNF treatment is highly effective in refractory inflammatory uveitis. BD is associated with increased odds of response. IFX and ADA appear to be equivalent in terms of efficacy.",43,2016-Jun-1

To report the primary endpoint analyses of the safety and efficacy of 2 different doses of intravenous (IV) infusions of tocilizumab (TCZ), an IL-6 inhibitor, in eyes with noninfectious intermediate uveitis, posterior uveitis, or panuveitis.
DESIGN: Randomized, controlled, multicenter clinical trial.
METHODS: STOP-Uveitis is a randomized, open-label safety, efficacy, and bioactivity clinical trial conducted at 5 clinical centers across the United States. The study evaluated the role of TCZ in patients with noninfectious uveitis (NIU). Thirty-seven patients with NIU were randomized into one of 2 treatment groups in a ratio of 1:1. Group 1 received IV infusions of 4 mg/kg TCZ and group 2 received IV infusions of 8 mg/kg TCZ. Infusions were given every 4 weeks in both groups until month 6 (primary endpoint). Primary outcome measure was incidence and severity of systemic and ocular adverse events through month 6. Secondary outcome measures included mean change in visual acuity (VA), vitreous haze (VH), and central macular thickness (CMT) at month 6.
RESULTS: A total of 37 patients were randomized in the study. At month 6, 43.5% of patients who had the potential for a 2-step decrease in VH demonstrated a 2-step decrease (40% in Group 1 and 46.1% in Group 2). Mean change in CMT was -83.88 ± 136.1 μm at month 6 (-131.5 ± 41.56 μm in Group 1 and -38.92 ± 13.7 μm in Group 2). Mean change in VA was +8.22 ± 11.83 ETDRS letters at month 6 (10.9 ± 14.6 in Group 1 and 5.5 ± 7.8 in Group 2). Repeated infusions of TCZ were well tolerated.
CONCLUSIONS: Repeated IV administrations of TCZ are well tolerated. TCZ (both 4 and 8 mg/kg) is effective in improving VA and reducing VH and CMT in eyes with noninfectious intermediate uveitis, posterior uveitis, and panuveitis.",43,2017-Nov-1

Increasing evidence supports Th17 cells as key mediators of ocular inflammatory disease. Cytokines that are important for the development and pathologic function of these cells are potential therapeutic targets in patients with immune mediated uveitis. This review provides an overview of these cytokines including recent insights about their roles in ocular inflammation from laboratory and clinical studies.
RECENT FINDINGS: Interleukin (IL)-6, IL-10, IL-17, IL-22, IL-23 and tumour necrosis factor-alpha (TNFα) are cytokines that have been examined for their functional role in uveitis and their relationship to pathologic Th17 cells. Studies in animal models, particularly in experimental autoimmune uveitis (EAU), have been instrumental in studying the role of these cytokines in disease pathogenesis. More recently, studies on aqueous, vitreous and serum from patients with uveitis using flow cytometry and multiplex ELISA bead-based methodologies have provided insights into the contribution of Th17 cells and the related cytokines in ocular inflammatory diseases. The central role of IL-23 in determining the pathologic Th17 fate has made it an effective therapeutic target in systemic diseases such as psoriasis and thereby an attractive potential target for patients with immune-mediated uveitis.
SUMMARY: Th17 cells, and their related cytokines, are important inflammatory mediators in autoimmune uveitis. Animal and human studies continue to provide new information to direct development of new cytokine-targeted therapies for patients with uveitis.",43,2018-May-1

Uveitis describes a group of conditions characterised by intraocular inflammation. The term uveitis technically describes inflammation of the uvea which comprises the iris, ciliary body and choroid, however now encompasses inflammation of adjacent intraocular structures such as the retina, vitreous and optic nerve. Uveitis is a significant cause of blindness worldwide, but its impact is generally underappreciated due to a lack of awareness and understanding of the condition among the public and most non-ophthalmic healthcare professionals. In this review, we provide an introduction to uveitis for the non-specialist, outlining the clinical presentations that should raise the suspicion of the disease, the signs that should be looked for and a framework in which to understand the condition. We show how a logical approach to classifying uveitis by aetiology and anatomical focus of disease provides the basis for treatment strategies (drug and route of administration) and clinical presentation and prognosis. We also show why understanding uveitis is helpful to clinicians working in almost every speciality due to the wide-ranging associations with systemic disease.",43,2017-Dec-1

The purpose of the present study was to elucidate the role of the polyol pathway enzyme aldose reductase (AR) in the mediation of ocular inflammation in a rat model of endotoxin-induced uveitis (EIU).
METHODS: EIU was induced by a subcutaneous injection of 200 microg lipopolysaccharide (LPS) in male Lewis rats treated with the AR inhibitor, zopolrestat (25 mg/kg body weight, intraperitoneally) or its carrier. The rats were killed 24 hours after LPS injection, the eyes were enucleated immediately, and aqueous humor (AqH) was collected. The number of infiltrating cells, protein concentration, and levels of nitric oxide (NO), tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-alpha, and prostaglandin E(2) (PGE(2)) in the AqH were determined. Immunohistochemical analysis was performed in paraformaldehyde-fixed eye sections by staining with antibodies against iNOS, COX-2, TNF-alpha, NF-kappaB, and AR. The levels of reactive oxygen species (ROS) in rat eye sections were determined by dihydroethidium (hydroethidine) fluorescence staining.
RESULTS: In the EIU rat eye AqH, both the number of infiltrating cells and protein concentrations of the inflammatory markers, TNF-alpha, NO, and PGE(2) were significantly higher than in the control rats, and inhibition of AR by zopolrestat suppressed the LPS-induced increases. The LPS-induced increased expression of AR, TNF-alpha, iNOS, and COX-2 proteins in the ciliary body, corneal epithelium, and retinal wall was also significantly inhibited by zopolrestat. Furthermore, AR inhibition prevented the LPS-induced increased levels of ROS and activation of NF-kappaB in the ciliary body, corneal epithelium, and retinal wall of the rat eye. AR inhibition also prevented the LPS-induced activation of NF-kappaB and expression of COX-2 and iNOS in the human monocyte cell line U-937.
CONCLUSIONS: The results indicate that AR inhibition suppresses the inflammation in EIU by blocking the expression and release of inflammatory markers in ocular tissues, along with the attenuation of NF-kappaB activation. This finding suggests that AR inhibition could be a novel therapeutic target for the treatment of uveitis and associated ocular inflammation.",43,2007-Oct-1

Experimental autoimmune uveitis (EAU) in animals serves as a model of human uveitis. EAU can be induced in mice by immunization with the retinal antigen interphotoreceptor retinoid binding protein (IRBP) in complete Freund's adjuvant (CFA) or by IRBP-pulsed mature dendritic cells, and can be driven either by a Th17 or a Th1 effector response, depending on the model. The direction of the response is affected by conditions present during the exposure to antigen, including the quality/quantity of innate receptor stimulation and/or type of APC. IL-17 and IFN-gamma production by innate cells such as NKT may also affect the disease process. If exposure to antigen is via a hydrodynamic DNA vaccination with an IRBP-encoding plasmid, the response is directed to a regulatory phenotype, and disease is ameliorated or prevented. Our data shed light on effector and regulatory responses in autoimmune disease, provide balance to the Th1/Th17 paradigm and help to explain the clinical heterogeneity of human uveitis, which occurs in the face of responses to the same ocular antigen(s).",43,2008-1-1

METHODS: IFN alfa-2a was administered at an initial dosage of 6 million IU per day, then tapered to a maintenance dosage of 3 million IU twice per week, and finally discontinued, if possible. In case of a relapse, IFN treatment was repeated. Visual acuity at the end of followup was compared with visual acuity when ocular disease was in remission.
RESULTS: Of 53 patients (96 eyes), 52 (98.1%) responded to IFN. In 47 patients (88.7%), IFN could be discontinued when the disease was in remission. Twenty of these 47 (42.6%) needed a second treatment course during a median followup of 6.0 years (range 2.0-12.6 years). Visual acuity improved or remained unchanged in 91 eyes (94.8%). Ocular disease was still in remission in 50% of the patients 45.9 months after cessation of the first IFN course. The relapse rate tended to be lower in women than in men. The BD activity score decreased significantly during followup, but long-term remission of nonocular BD manifestations was not achieved. However, since local treatments were sufficient, no systemic treatment was administered.
CONCLUSION: Our findings indicate that IFNα induces long-lasting remission in patients with severe ocular BD, resulting in a notable improvement in visual prognosis.",43,2010-Sep-1

The purpose of the study is to delineate the visual prognosticators in sarcoid-associated uveitis given the current standards of care.
METHODS: The records of 60 patients with sarcoid-associated uveitis who were observed for at least 6 months were studied retrospectively. Multivariate regression models using the generalized estimating equations approach to adjust for the correlation between fellow eyes were applied to determine disease, patient, and treatment characteristics that altered the odds of visual rehabilitation.
RESULTS: One hundred twelve eyes of 43 women and 17 men who met the inclusion criteria were identified. Seventy-seven percent of patients were white, 15% black, and 8% of Hispanic origin. Uveitis developed in the patients at a mean age of 42 (range, 4-82) years. Of the 112 affected eyes, 81% had granulomatous and 15% nongranulomatous uveitis. Most patients (66%) had anterior or intermediate uveitis alone. Ninety-one percent had chronically smoldering disease; another 7% had recurrent flares, and only 1 patient had a monophasic acute course to her uveitis. Vision-threatening complications developed in many patients, including 58% in whom cystoid macular edema developed and 25% in whom media opacities developed, requiring cataract surgery or vitrectomy or both. Overall, 34% of treated eyes and 51% of patients had final visual acuities that were superior to their acuities at presentation. The factors most significantly associated with a final visual acuity of worse than 20/40 after controlling for potential confounders were as follows: delay in presentation to a subspecialist (odds ratio [OR] = 2.94, P = 0.05), total duration of uveitis (OR = 1.04, P = 0.09), development of cystoid macular edema (OR = 0.37, P = 0.07) or glaucoma (OR = 4.54, P = 0.02), presence of intermediate (OR = 5.00, P = 0.01) or posterior uveitis (OR = 8.33, P = 0.04), and systemic steroid use (OR = 0.30, P = 0.03) were the parameters most strongly correlated with a lack of visual acuity improvement. Delay in presentation to a subspecialist (OR = 20.00, P = 0.01), development of glaucoma (OR = 50.00, P = 0.005), presence of intermediate (OR = 25.00, P = 0.02) or posterior uveitis (OR = 50.00, P = 0.02), black race (OR = 11.11, P = 0.02), (log) visual acuity at presentation (OR = 0.05, P = 0.0001), and use of systemic steroids (OR = 0.07, P = 0.02).
CONCLUSION: Multivariate outcomes analysis, particularly after correcting for the correlation between fellow eyes, is a useful analytic tool for optimization of standards of care and for disease risk stratification to aid both physicians and patients.",42,1996-Nov-1

Incorrect diagnosis of the uveitic masquerade syndromes (UMS) may have severe consequences. In this study, the frequency, clinical manifestations, and informative diagnostic tests for UMS are described.
DESIGN: Retrospective observational case series.
PARTICIPANTS: Forty patients with UMS were identified in a cohort of 828 consecutive patients with uveitis. The mean follow-up was 4.5 years.
METHODS: A review of clinical, laboratory, photographic, and angiographic records was performed.
MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Clinical features, associated systemic diseases, diagnostic procedures and their role in the diagnostic process, and systemic and visual outcomes.
RESULTS: Nineteen patients had intraocular malignancy (48% of all with UMS; 2.3% of all with uveitis), mainly intraocular lymphoma (n = 13) and leukemia (n = 3). The ophthalmologist was the first to recognize malignant disease in 11 of 19 patients (58%). Of 21 patients with nonmalignant UMS, 10 had an ocular vascular disease and 5 a hereditary ocular disorder. The patients with malignant UMS were older than those with nonmalignant UMS (average age, 50 vs 44 years, P: < 0.05). During follow-up, 9 of 19 patients with malignant UMS died. The most informative diagnostic procedure for malignant UMS was intraocular fluid analysis; for nonmalignant UMS, fluorescein angiography. The cytologic analysis of intraocular fluids yielded the best results for diagnosing intraocular malignancies (7 of 11 patients, 64%); the association of negative cytologic results with the recent administration of systemic corticosteroids was noted. Immunophenotyping of the aqueous confirmed the diagnosis of hematologic malignancy for 3 of 5 patients examined. Panuveitis was the most frequent manifestation of malignant UMS. Intraocular lymphomas presented with isolated vitreitis (n = 6), chorioretinal lesions (n = 5) and iris infiltration (n = 2). Clinical presentation of nonmalignant UMS was diverse but consisted mainly of abnormalities of the retinal vasculature.
CONCLUSIONS: UMS was diagnosed in 5% of the patients with uveitis at a tertiary center. Despite the variety of underlying disorders and different clinical presentations, a high frequency of malignant and vascular diseases was found. Awareness of the clinical manifestations of UMS and application of the correct diagnostic procedures should promote timely diagnosis and treatment, which are essential not only for visual acuity but also for the life of the patient.",42,2001-Feb-1

To evaluate safety and efficacy of adalimumab in patients with noninfectious intermediate, posterior, or panuveitis.
DESIGN: Phase 3, open-label, multicenter clinical trial extension (VISUAL III).
PARTICIPANTS: Adults meeting treatment failure (TF) criteria or who completed VISUAL I or II (phase 3, randomized, double-masked, placebo-controlled) without TF.
METHODS: Patients received adalimumab 40 mg every other week. Interim follow-up data were described from VISUAL III weeks 0 through 78.
MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Disease quiescence, steroid-free quiescence, active inflammatory chorioretinal/retinal vascular lesions, anterior chamber cell grade, vitreous haze grade, best-corrected visual acuity (BCVA), and corticosteroid dose. Binary data were reported using nonresponder imputation (NRI), continuous data using last observation carried forward and as-observed analysis, and corticosteroid dose using observed-case analysis. Adverse events (AEs) were reported from first adalimumab dose in VISUAL III through interim cutoff.
RESULTS: Of 424 patients enrolled, 371 were included in intent-to-treat analysis. At study entry, 242 of 371 (65%) patients had active uveitis; 60% (145/242, NRI) achieved quiescence at week 78, and 66% (95/143, as-observed) of those were corticosteroid free. At study entry, 129 of 371 (35%) patients had inactive uveitis; 74% (96/129, NRI) achieved quiescence at week 78, and 93% (89/96, as-observed) of those were corticosteroid free. Inflammatory lesions, anterior chamber grade, and vitreous haze grade showed initial improvement followed by decline in patients with active uveitis and remained stable in patients with inactive uveitis. BCVA improved in patients with active uveitis from weeks 0 to 78 (0.27 to 0.14 logMAR; left and right eyes; as-observed) and remained stable in patients with inactive uveitis. Mean corticosteroid dose decreased from 13.6 mg/day (week 0) to 2.6 mg/day (week 78) in patients with active uveitis and remained stable in those with inactive uveitis (1.5-1.2 mg/day). AEs (424 events/100 patient-years) and serious AEs (16.5 events/100 patient-years) were comparable with previous VISUAL trials.
CONCLUSIONS: Patients with active uveitis at study entry who received adalimumab therapy were likely to achieve quiescence, improve visual acuity, and reduce their daily uveitis-related systemic corticosteroid use. Most patients with inactive uveitis at study entry sustained quiescence without a systemic corticosteroid dose increase. No new safety signals were identified.",42,2018-Jul-1

Eradication of systemic tuberculosis (TB) has been limited by neglected populations and the HIV pandemic. Whereas ocular TB often presents as uveitis without any prior evidence of systemic TB, the existing uncertainty in the diagnosis of TB uveitis may perpetuate missed opportunities to address systemic TB.
OBJECTIVE: To examine the clinical features of TB uveitis and the associations with response to antitubercular therapy (ATT).
DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: This retrospective multinational cohort study included patients from 25 ophthalmology referral centers diagnosed with TB uveitis and treated with ATT from January 1, 2004, through December 31, 2014, with a minimum follow-up of 1 year.
MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: Treatment failure, defined as a persistence or recurrence of inflammation within 6 months of completing ATT, inability to taper oral corticosteroids to less than 10 mg/d or topical corticosteroid drops to less than 2 drops daily, and/or recalcitrant inflammation necessitating corticosteroid-sparing immunosuppressive therapy.
RESULTS: A total of 801 patients (1272 eyes) were studied (mean [SD] age, 40.5 [14.8] years; 413 [51.6%] male and 388 [48.4%] female; 577 [73.6%] Asian). Most patients had no known history (498 of 661 [75.3%]) of systemic TB. Most patients had bilateral involvement (471 of 801 [58.8%]). Common clinical signs reported include vitreous haze (523 of 1153 [45.4%]), retinal vasculitis (374 of 874 [42.8%]), and choroidal involvement (419 of 651 [64.4%]). Treatment failure developed in 102 of the 801 patients (12.7%). On univariate regression analysis, the hazard ratios (HRs) associated with intermediate uveitis (HR, 2.21; 95% CI, 1.07-4.55; P = .03), anterior uveitis (HR, 2.68; 95% CI, 1.32-2.35; P = .006), and panuveitis (HR, 3.28; 95% CI, 1.89-5.67; P < .001) were significantly higher compared with posterior distribution. The presence of vitreous haze had a statistically significant association (HR, 1.95; 95% CI, 1.26-3.02; P = .003) compared with absence of vitreous haze. Bilaterality had an associated HR of 1.50 (95% CI, 0.96-2.35) compared with unilaterality (HR, 1 [reference]), although this finding was not statistically significant (P = .07). On multivariate Cox proportional hazards regression analysis, the presence of vitreous haze had an adjusted HR of 2.98 (95% CI, 1.50-5.94; P = .002), presence of snow banking had an adjusted HR of 3.71 (95% CI, 1.18-11.62; P = .02), and presence of choroidal involvement had an adjusted HR of 2.88 (95% CI, 1.22-6.78; P = .02).
CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: A low treatment failure rate occurred in patients with TB uveitis treated with ATT. Phenotypes and test results are studied whereby patients with panuveitis having vitreous and choroidal involvement had a higher risk of treatment failure. These findings are limited by retrospective methods. A prospectively derived composite clinical risk score might address this diagnostic uncertainty through holistic and standardized assessment of the combinations of clinical features and investigation results that may warrant diagnosis of TB uveitis and treatment with ATT.",42,2017-Dec-01

The level of Interleukin-6 (IL-6) in the aqueous humor of 24 patients with 2 types of uveitis was measured with a specific bioassay using the murine hybridoma cell line B9. Sixteen patients had Fuchs' heterochromic cyclitis (FHC) and 8 had toxoplasma uveitis (TU). Sixty-three percent of each of the FHC and TU groups had raised levels of IL-6 in their aqueous (mean: 543 and 19,228 units/ml respectively). Thirteen control aqueous samples, obtained at surgery for senile cataract, showed IL-6 levels of less than 10 units/ml. Serum obtained at the same time as each aqueous humor sample also showed IL-6 levels of less than 10 units/ml, indicating that the raised levels of IL-6 found in the aqueous of uveitis patients did not result from serum leakage, but from local production. This is the first report on intraocular IL-6 levels, and indicates that IL-6 may play a role as an inflammatory mediator in uveitis.",42,1990-May-1

The purpose of the study is to delineate the visual prognosticators in juvenile rheumatoid arthritis-associated uveitis.
METHODS: The records of 43 patients with juvenile rheumatoid arthritis-associated uveitis who were observed for at least 6 months were studied retrospectively. Bivariate and multivariate statistical models were applied to more than 40 parameters to determine the relative odds of visual rehabilitation among patients with each characteristic.
RESULTS: Thirty-seven (86%) patients were females and 6 (14%) males. The mean known age of uveitis onset was 13 years, with females having, on average, 4 years earlier onset of disease compared to males (P = 0.04). Ninety-three percent had chronic, 5% had recurrent, and 2% had an acute monophasic disease course. Of the 76 affected eyes, 93% were nongranulomatous and 97% had iridocyclitis. The mean overall duration of uveitis was 146 months, with females suffering from a significantly longer duration of active disease than did males (P < 0.001). Nineteen (44%) patients underwent cataract extraction, and 16 (37%) underwent vitrectomy. Thirty (70%) of the patients experienced visual improvement with their therapy. When controlling for potential confounders, male sex (P = 0.006), shorter duration of uveitis (P = 0.007), older age at disease onset (P = 0.02), and a shorter delay in presentation to a subspecialist (P = 0.02) were associated significantly with visual acuity improvement. Visual acuity at presentation (P = 0.001), use of systemic nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (P = 0.01), older age at disease onset (P = 0.02), absence of glaucomatous neuropathy (P = 0.02), and male sex (P = 0.03) were correlated strongly with a final visual acuity outcome of 20/40 or better.
CONCLUSION: Juvenile rheumatoid arthritis-associated uveitis is a serious disease with a guarded visual prognosis. It is hoped that increased awareness of its prognosticators will lead to treatment and referral patterns that have the best chance of minimizing the likelihood of visual impairment in patients with juvenile rheumatoid arthritis.",41,1997-Feb-1

To critically assess the evidence base regarding outcomes following cataract surgery in uveitic cases.
DESIGN: Systematic evidence-based review and meta-analysis.
METHODS: A comprehensive search query was performed on MEDLINE, EMBASE, CINHAL, and CENTRAL databases. Relevant publications were identified by reviewing query results and reference list searches.
RESULTS: A total of 89 articles met eligibility criteria. Among uveitic eyes with quiet or mostly quiet uveitis before cataract surgery, 20/40 visual acuity or better (≥20/40) was achieved in 68% following phacoemulsification, 72% following extracapsular cataract extraction, and 40% following pars plana lensectomy. More eyes undergoing cataract surgery with intraocular lens (IOL) implantation than eyes left aphakic achieved ≥20/40 postoperatively (71% vs 52%). Eyes receiving acrylic IOLs or heparin-surface-modified (HSM) polymethylmethacrylate had better visual outcomes than those receiving non-HSM polymethylmethacrylate or silicone IOLs. Active uveitis at the time of cataract surgery was associated with worse visual outcomes. Compared with other uveitis cases, the proportion achieving 20/40 or better post cataract surgery was better for Fuchs heterochromic cyclitis cases and worse for uveitis related to Behçet disease, Vogt-Koyanagi-Harada disease, or sympathetic ophthalmia, and also posterior uveitis in general.
CONCLUSION: Cataract surgery in eyes with uveitis resulted in normal range levels of visual acuity in most cases. The review suggests that preoperative control of uveitis, use of an acrylic or HSM IOL, and a diagnosis of Fuchs heterochromic cyclitis were associated with better outcomes. Posterior-involving uveitides tended to do worse, likely because of vision-limiting complications of uveitis. Average results may not be applicable to specific clinical scenarios.",41,2014-Oct-1

To evaluate the safety and efficacy of abatacept in patients with severe juvenile idiopathic arthritis (JIA)-related uveitis refractory or intolerant to immunosuppressive and anti-tumor necrosis factor alpha (anti-TNFalpha) agents.
METHODS: Patients with JIA-related uveitis refractory to immunosuppressive and anti-TNFalpha agents were treated with intravenous abatacept (10 mg/kg monthly). Side effects, frequency of uveitis flares, and ocular complications before and after treatment were reported.
RESULTS: Seven patients (6 females and 1 male) with a mean uveitis duration of 11.6 years entered the study. All patients had failed previous immunosuppressive therapy and >or=2 anti-TNFalpha treatments. All patients responded to abatacept and 6 maintained a clinical remission after a mean of 9.2 months of treatment. One patient withdrew from the study with oral mycosis and arthritis flare; no other patients had side effects. The mean frequency of uveitis flares during the 6 months before and after treatment decreased from 3.7 to 0.7 episodes. No new ocular complications or worsening of preexisting ones were reported.
CONCLUSION: Abatacept treatment led to sustained improvement in severe anti-TNFalpha-resistant JIA-related uveitis and was well tolerated in all but 1 patient. These results provide new insights into a possible indication of abatacept for the treatment of uveitis.",41,2010-Jun-1

Non-infectious uveitis (NIU) is an immune-mediated disease with clinical symptoms such as eye pain, redness, floaters, and light sensitivity. NIU is one of the leading causes of preventable blindness.
OBJECTIVE: This review describes current and emerging therapies for NIU.
METHODS: PubMed searches were conducted using the terms uveitis, therapy, corticosteroids, immunomodulators, biologics, intravitreal injections, intraocular implants, and adverse events deemed relevant if they presented data relating to prevalence, diagnosis, and treatment of uveitis.
RESULTS: Diagnosis and management of NIU may require collaboration among different healthcare providers, including ophthalmologists and rheumatologists. Although many patients with NIU respond to corticosteroid (CS) therapy, long-term CS use can be associated with potentially severe adverse events. Localized CS therapies have been developed to reduce adverse events; however, some intravitreal injections and intraocular implants were linked to elevated intraocular pressure and cataracts. CS-sparing therapies such as biologics have demonstrated efficacy and safety while reducing CS burden. Biologics targeting tumor necrosis factor provide CS-sparing options for patients with NIU. Additional studies are needed to address long-term efficacy and safety of biologics targeting IL-6 and inhibitors of JAK/STAT.
CONCLUSION: Biologics, JAK/STAT inhibitors, and improved localized therapies may provide additional options for patients with NIU.",41,2019-Dec-1

Ocular inflammatory disease is a leading cause of vision loss worldwide. Uveitis encompasses a wide spectrum of pathology, both with respect to its etiology and the anatomic location within the eye. Inflammation can be confined to the eye and may also be seen systemically. The cornerstone of management of ocular inflammatory disease historically has been corticosteroids, which are invaluable in the immediate control of inflammation; however, corticosteroids are inappropriate for long-term use as they are associated with a wide array of toxic side effects. As we continue to learn more about the various etiologies and elucidate the basic science pathways and mechanisms of action that cause intraocular inflammation, new therapeutic approaches have evolved. They include employment of immunomodulatory agents (corticosteroid-sparing therapies) that have expanded our treatment options for these vision-threatening diseases. These pharmacologics provide therapy for ocular and systemic inflammation in an individualized, patient-tailored, stepladder approach with the ultimate goal of durable, corticosteroid-free remission. We review the preferred practice patterns of a tertiary care center specializing in ocular inflammatory disease.",41,2016-1-1

Sixteen patients (ten women and six men, ranging in age from 20 to 67 years) with active bilateral posterior uveitis of noninfectious origin were treated with cyclosporin A, a specific anti-T-cell medication. All had previously received systemic corticosteroids or cytotoxic agents or both and had responded poorly or had intolerable side effects. Fifteen of 16 patients had positive responses to oral cyclosporin A therapy (initially 10 mg/kg of body weight/day), measured by a decrease in inflammatory activity, with a concomitant improvement in visual acuity in most patients. Fluorescein angiographic findings varied considerably with some patients showing an improvement with continued cystoid macular edema. Renal toxicity occurred in five patients, but renal function reverted toward normal with a decrease in cyclosporin A dosage.",40,1983-Sep-1

To describe clinical features of chronic anterior uveitis in children at presentation to a referral center (baseline); to identify relationships between demographic, medical, and ophthalmic factors at baseline; and to determine baseline factors that predict new complications and vision loss during follow-up.
DESIGN: Retrospective case series.
METHODS: Studied were involved eyes of all children (age < or =16 years at disease onset) with chronic anterior uveitis who were examined by 1 clinician from 1993 through 2006. Cross-sectional analyses compared baseline findings. Relationships between potential risk factors and incident adverse events (new complications, vision loss) were studied by Kaplan-Meier and Cox proportional hazards regression models.
RESULTS: There were 115 patients (200 eyes) who met inclusion criteria. Follow-up (n = 83 patients) ranged from 0.4 to 157.5 months (median, 23.5 months). There were numerous strong relationships between 8 defined complications at baseline in pairwise comparisons. Flare was the inflammatory sign most consistently associated with complications at baseline. Baseline factors that predicted new complications during follow-up included age < or =3 years, elevated cells, elevated flare, keratic precipitates, signs of intermediate uveitis, and papillitis (all P < .043); factors that predicted vision loss included male gender, increased flare, signs of intermediate uveitis, papillitis, and baseline complications (all P < .015). Not related to new complications were presence of juvenile idiopathic uveitis and immunomodulatory therapy.
CONCLUSION: Chronic anterior uveitis in children is associated with various vision-threatening complications that occur in combinations. Complications develop early in the disease course.

The causes of posterior uveitis can be divided into infectious, autoimmune, or masquerade syndromes. Viral infections, a significant cause of sight-threatening ocular diseases in the posterior segment, include human herpesviruses, measles, rubella, and arboviruses such as dengue, West Nile, and chikungunya virus. Viral posterior uveitis may occur as an isolated ocular disease in congenital or acquired infections or as part of a systemic viral illness. Many viruses remain latent in the infected host with a risk of reactivation that depends on various factors, including virulence and host immunity, age, and comorbidities. Although some viral illnesses are self-limiting and have a good visual prognosis, others, such as cytomegalovirus retinitis or acute retinal necrosis, may result in serious complications and profound vision loss. Since some of these infections may respond well to antiviral therapy, it is important to work up all cases of posterior uveitis to rule out an infectious etiology. We review the clinical features, diagnostic tools, treatment regimens, and long-term outcomes for each of these viral posterior uveitides.",40,2017-1-1

To summarize the prevalence and patterns of uveitis in children.
METHODS: Pertinent articles were reviewed.
RESULTS: Children constitute 5-10% of the patients with uveitis seen at tertiary referral centers, and girls appear to develop uveitis slightly more frequently than boys. Among all children with intraocular inflammation, anterior uveitis accounts for 30-40%, posterior uveitis accounts for 40-50%, intermediate uveitis accounts for 10-20%, and diffuse uveitis accounts for 5-10%. The most common cause of anterior uveitis is juvenile idiopathic arthritis (JIA), whereas the most frequent type of posterior uveitis is toxoplasmic retinochoroiditis. Most cases of intermediate and diffuse uveitis are bilateral, chronic, and idiopathic. The most common causes of vision loss in children with uveitis are cataract, band keratopathy, glaucoma, and cystoid macular edema. Up to one-third of the children with uveitis are left with severely impaired vision as a result of these complications.
CONCLUSIONS: Uveitis is an important cause of ocular morbidity in children. Prompt diagnosis and treatment is essential to minimize the risk of long-term vision loss.",40,2000-Dec-1

Uveitis in juvenile idiopathic arthritis (JIA) is frequently associated with the development of complications and visual loss. Topical corticosteroids are the first-choice therapy, and immunosuppression is commonly used. However, treatment has not been standardized. Representatives from the German Ophthalmological Society, Society for Childhood and Adolescent Rheumatology, and the German Society for Rheumatology reached consensus on a standardized treatment strategy according to disease severity in the individual patient. The recommendations were based on a systematic literature analysis in MEDLINE and consensus expert meetings. Evidence and recommendations were graded, and an algorithm for anti-inflammatory treatment and final statements confirmed in a Delphi method. An interdisciplinary, evidence-based treatment guideline for JIA uveitis is presented.",40,2012-May-1

Blau syndrome (BS) is a rare autosomal dominant, autoinflammatory syndrome characterized by the clinical triad of granulomatous recurrent uveitis, dermatitis and symmetric arthritis. The gene responsible for BS has been identified in the caspase recruitment domain gene CARD15/NOD2. In the majority of patients, the disease is characterized by early onset, usually before 3-4years of age. The manifestations at disease onset are usually represented by articular and cutaneous involvement signs, generally followed later by ocular manifestations which are often the most relevant morbidity of BS. In some cases the presence of fever is also observed; atypical cases of BS have been reported with cardiovascular, neurological, renal, intestinal and other organ involvement. The rarity and the variations in the severity and evolution of its expressions do not permit sufficient data about optimal treatment for patients with BS. The first step of therapy is represented by the use of corticosteroids and successively, in case of unsatisfactory response, by additional treatment with immunosuppressive agents. The results with biologic anti-cytokine agents, such as anti-TNFα and anti-IL1β, are different, particularly with regard to ocular morbidity. Clinical and genetic aspects of the familial and the sporadic form of BS will be discussed and focused on. A description of a case study of an Italian family is also included.",40,2012-Nov-1

The incidence of syphilis and syphilitic uveitis in our community is increasing. The prevalence of associated neurosyphilis is unknown, and it remains unclear whether syphilitic uveitis should be treated as secondary syphilis with intramuscular penicillin or neurosyphilis with intravenous penicillin. The (English language) literature was reviewed for all unique cases of syphilitic uveitis reported from 1984 to June 2008. For each case the following data were recorded: the clinical features of the syphilis, the uveitis and any associated neurosyphilis, the human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) status, lumbar puncture findings, treatment and follow up. We identified 143 patients in 41 original reports of syphilitic uveitis (93 HIV-positive and 50 HIV-negative). Posterior uveitis was reported in 79 patients (55.2%); panuveitis was reported in 36 patients (25.2%); anterior/intermediate uveitis was reported in only 28 patients (19.6%). Lumbar puncture findings were abnormal in 82 patients (57%), and the majority of these patients (76%, 62 out of 82) were HIV-positive. One hundred and ten (77%) patients were treated with intravenous therapy, usually penicillin. Most recovered from the syphilis, however, a proportion did not recover full vision. There were 13 (9%) treatment failures, which tended to occur in patients who were HIV-positive (n = 11), had abnormal lumbar puncture findings (n = 8) and/or were treated (n = 11) intravenously. There is a high incidence of abnormal lumbar puncture findings in patients with syphilitic uveitis and a strong association with HIV infection. Most received appropriate therapy with a low relapse rate, which was not related to the type of therapy.",40,2010-Jan-1

Experimental autoimmune uveoretinitis (EAU) in animals can be induced by immunization with retinal antigens or their fragments and represents human uveitis of putative autoimmune origin. The pathogenesis of EAU, and likely also of human uveitis, involves cell-mediated destruction of retinal tissues that is dependent on retinal antigen-specific T cells. Because in most cases a Th1-type response has been implicated in pathogenesis, the prevailing consensus has been that immunoregulatory manipulations designed to enhance the Th2 response at the expense of the Th1 response will be beneficial in clinical treatment of uveitis. This assumption may not always be correct. The present review will summarize the evidence that, despite a central role for Th1 response in uveitis, an unopposed Th2-like response can be equally or more destructive to the retinal tissues. Furthermore, the Th1 response itself triggers regulatory circuits that feed back and dampen further recruitment of antigen-specific T cells into the Th1 effector pool. Thus, although the Th1 effector response can and does result in retinal pathology, immunoregulatory strategies must take into account that immune deviation therapies designed to replace the Th1 with a Th2 response might result in exchanging one type of pathology for another rather than in achieving the desired therapeutic effect.",40,2002-1-1

Autophagy is critical for maintaining cellular homeostasis. Organs such as the eye and brain are immunologically privileged. Here, we demonstrate that autophagy is essential for maintaining ocular immune privilege. Deletion of multiple autophagy genes in macrophages leads to an inflammation-mediated eye disease called uveitis that can cause blindness. Loss of autophagy activates inflammasome-mediated IL1B secretion that increases disease severity. Inhibition of caspase activity by gene deletion or pharmacological means completely reverses the disease phenotype. Of interest, experimental uveitis was also increased in a model of Crohn disease, a systemic autoimmune disease in which patients often develop uveitis, offering a potential mechanistic link between macrophage autophagy and systemic disease. These findings directly implicate the homeostatic process of autophagy in blinding eye disease and identify novel pathways for therapeutic intervention in uveitis.",39,2016-Oct-02

Uveitis is a frequent (20-50%) and early feature of sarcoidosis. Typical sarcoid uveitis presents with mutton-fat keratic precipitates, iris nodules, and anterior and posterior synechiae. Posterior involvement includes vitreitis, vasculitis, and choroidal lesions. Cystoid macular edema is the most important and sight-threatening consequence. Histologic proof from a biopsy is the gold standard for the diagnosis of ocular sarcoidosis. An international workshop has recently established diagnostic criteria for sarcoidosis uveitis when biopsy is unavailable or negative: these are based on a combination of ophthalmological findings and laboratory tests. The value of recent techniques, such as PET-scan and endoscopic ultrasound-guided, fine-needle aspiration of intrathoracic nodes needs to be assessed in future studies. Corticosteroids are the mainstay treatment for sarcoidosis. Systemic corticosteroids are indicated when uveitis does not respond to topical corticosteroids or when there is bilateral posterior involvement, especially macular edema and occlusive vasculitis. In up to 15% of cases, additional immunosuppression is used, including methotrexate, azathioprine, and mycophenolate mofetil. Infliximab and adalimumab have been recently proposed for the treatment of refractory or sight-threatening systemic sarcoidosis.",39,2014-Aug-1

Myeloperoxidase (MPO) activity was measured in rabbit cornea and iris-ciliary body to quantitate the infiltration and accumulation of polymorphonuclear leucocytes (PMN's) following an inflammatory stimulus. Following injection of clove oil into the cornea, MPO activity could be detected in the cornea at 6 hr, reaching a maximum at 12 hr, and falling to non-detectable levels at 72 hr. MPO activity was only detected in the iris-ciliary body 24 hr after intracorneal clove oil injection. MPO activity in the iris-ciliary body increased in a dose-dependent manner following intravitreal injection of endotoxin. No MPO activity could be detected in cornea. Topical administration of dexamethasone inhibited MPO activity in cornea and iris-ciliary body 24 hr after intracorneal clove oil and intravitreal endotoxin injection, respectively. Measurement of MPO activity in ocular tissues could provide a useful tool to quantitatively evaluate the severity and time course of inflammation.",39,N/A-1-1

To describe the different retinal morphological characteristics that can present on optical coherence topography (OCT) in a spectrum of uveitic diseases.
METHODS: We reviewed the literature and our own OCT image archive for characteristic features that may be suggestive of a particular disease process.
RESULTS: OCT demonstrates a variety of characteristic morphological changes, some that may point towards a specific disease process. We describe the various forms of macular oedema found in uveitis as well as OCT features typically found in multifocal choroiditis, serpiginous chorioretinitis, toxoplasma chorioretinitis, Vogt-Koyanagi-Harada, sympathetic ophthalmia and the vitreomacular traction syndrome.
CONCLUSION: Ophthalmologists should be aware of the variety of retinal morphological characteristics that can present on OCT in uveitic disease. Recognition may aid in the diagnostic process, which is complementary to conventional fundal photography and fluorescein angiography. This can facilitate earlier diagnosis and, more importantly, the initiation of specific treatment.",39,2007-Dec-1

We investigated the frequencies and clinical characteristics of Japanese patients with uveitis.
METHODS: Records of 189 patients referred from April 1999 to March 2001 were retrospectively reviewed.
RESULTS: Fifty-six patients (29.6%) had anterior uveitis, 13 (6.9%) intermediate uveitis, 59 (31.2%) posterior uveitis, 58 (30.7%) panuveitis, and three (1.6%) papillitis. The most common diagnoses were Vogt-Koyanagi-Harada (VKH) disease (10.1%), biopsy-proven or presumed sarcoidosis (9.5%), acute anterior uveitis (7.9%), tuberculosis (6.9%), and Behçet's disease (5.8%). Seventy-three patients (38.6%) were treated with local therapy alone, and 95 patients (50.3%) required systemic therapy. Ocular complications developed in 19.6% of patients, and systemic complications in 2.1%.
CONCLUSIONS: These results confirm a continued high frequency of VKH disease and sarcoidosis, but suggest a decreased frequency of Behçet's disease and an increased frequency of tuberculosis. Roughly one-half of the patients required systemic treatment in addition to local therapy, and ocular and/or systemic complications developed in one-fifth of the patients.",39,2003-Dec-1

Behçet's disease (BD) is a systemic immune-mediated vasculitis of unclear origin. Major symptoms include oral aphthous ulcers, genital ulcerations, skin lesions, and ocular lesions. Eye involvement, which affects 60-80% of BD patients, is characterized by posterior or panuveitis with occlusive retinal vasculitis. The pathogenesis of BD remains unclear, but research of the last decades has shown a complex role of genetic factors (HLA-B51) predisposing to inflammation with involvement of the innate-immune system (neutrophils, NK cells), perpetuated by the adaptive immune response, most importantly T cells, against infectious- and/or auto-antigens. Despite aggressive immunosuppressive treatment, the visual prognosis of ocular BD was generally poor to date. Recently, novel biologic drugs, including interferon-alpha and tumour necrosis factor (TNF)-alpha-antagonists have been introduced in the treatment of ocular BD with very promising results and seem for the first time to improve the prognosis of the disease. This article will provide a current review of BD including recent developments in epidemiology, immunology, genetics, and treatment.",39,2008-Jan-1

Corticosteroids (CS) are the only approved drug class for treatment of noninfectious uveitis by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration. Serious side effects are associated with chronic use of systemic CS; established guidelines recommend the use of steroid-sparing agents if control of uveitis cannot be achieved with ≤ 10 mg/day of prednisone (or equivalent) within 3 months. This study evaluated the treatment patterns among physicians who routinely manage patients with noninfectious uveitis to determine how treatment guidelines are followed.
DESIGN: Cross-sectional, multicenter study conducted across the United States.
PARTICIPANTS: Sixty ophthalmologists and 3 rheumatologists were recruited using payer reimbursement International Classification of Diseases, Ninth Revision codes.
METHODS: Patient data were reported using a study-specific questionnaire. Physicians were also asked if they were aware of or used recommended treatment guidelines.
MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Uveitis treatment patterns were compared with guidelines.
RESULTS: Physicians managed a mean of 5555 patients; patients with uveitis who required systemic CS treatment comprised approximately 5% of each physician's practice. A total of 580 patients with noninfectious uveitis were randomly selected for analyses. Anterior uveitis requiring systemic therapy was diagnosed in 168 patients (29%), intermediate uveitis was diagnosed in 140 patients (24%), posterior uveitis was diagnosed in 150 patients (26%), and panuveitis was diagnosed in 122 patients (21%); 199 patients (34%) had active disease. The mean time interval from the diagnosis of uveitis to the time of survey was 3.1 to 4.5 years. A systemic disorder was associated with uveitis in 16% to 54% of patients; 57% to 100% of patients received systemic immunosuppressive therapy. In all, 360 of 580 patients (62%) received systemic CS, with a mean initial daily dose of 44 mg, tapered to 34 mg prednisone (or equivalent) as maintenance dose. Among physicians surveyed, 75% did not use or were not aware of treatment guidelines for uveitis.
CONCLUSIONS: The study reveals that the majority of physicians surveyed are not familiar with or do not adhere to currently recommended guidelines for management of uveitis. High CS doses are used to maintain control of disease, and there is a low level of awareness of recommended guidelines to treat noninfectious uveitis. The finding underscores the need to place further emphasis on educating the medical community and reinforcing treatment guidelines to improve the care of patients with uveitis.",39,2011-Jan-1

To assess the efficacy of tocilizumab (TCZ) for the treatment of juvenile idiopathic arthritis (JIA)-associated uveitis.
METHODS: We conducted a multicenter study of patients with JIA-associated uveitis that was refractory to conventional immunosuppressive drugs and anti-tumor necrosis factor (anti-TNF) agents.
RESULTS: We assessed 25 patients (21 female; 47 affected eyes) with a mean ± SD age of 18.5 ± 8.3 years. Uveitis was bilateral in 22 patients. Cystoid macular edema was present in 9 patients. Ocular sequelae found at initiation of TCZ included cataracts (n = 13), glaucoma (n = 7), synechiae (n = 10), band keratopathy (n = 12), maculopathy (n = 9), and amblyopia (n = 5). Before TCZ, patients had received corticosteroids, conventional immunosuppressive drugs, and biologic agents (median 2 [range 1-5]), including adalimumab (n = 24), etanercept (n = 8), infliximab (n = 7), abatacept (n = 6), rituximab (n = 2), anakinra (n = 1), and golimumab (n = 1). Patients received 8 mg/kg TCZ intravenously every 4 weeks in most cases. TCZ yielded rapid and maintained improvement in all ocular parameters. After 6 months of therapy, 79.2% of patients showed improvement in anterior chamber cell numbers, and 88.2% showed improvement after 1 year. Central macular thickness measured by optical coherence tomography in patients with cystoid macular edema decreased from a mean ± SD of 401.7 ± 86.8 μm to 259.1 ± 39.5 μm after 6 months of TCZ (P = 0.012). The best-corrected visual acuity increased from 0.56 ± 0.35 to 0.64 ± 0.32 (P < 0.01). After a median follow-up of 12 months, visual improvement persisted, and complete remission of uveitis was observed in 19 of 25 patients. Significant reduction in the prednisone dosage was also achieved. The main adverse effects were severe autoimmune thrombocytopenia in 1 patient, pneumonia and then autoimmune anemia and thrombocytopenia in 1 patient, and viral conjunctivitis and bullous impetigo in 1 patient.
CONCLUSION: TCZ appears to be a useful therapy for severe refractory JIA-associated uveitis.",39,2017-Mar-1

TESTING: Patients with suspected CME underwent OCT scanning followed by FFA at the same visit.
MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Detection and distribution of macular edema.
RESULTS: One hundred eight eyes had similar results on both OCT and FFA in that 67 eyes had CME and 41 eyes had no CME. In 10 eyes subretinal fluid was detected on OCT but not FFA. Five of these eyes had CME on FFA but not OCT. Three other eyes had CME that was detected by FFA but not by OCT. Compared with FFA, the OCT sensitivity for detecting CME was 96% (including the eyes with subretinal fluid), and the OCT specificity was 100%.

To describe the efficacy of anti-TNF-alpha agents in the treatment of childhood uveitis.
METHODS: We performed a retrospective chart review of all children with uveitis treated with TNF-alpha blockers at The Hospital for Sick Children, Toronto.
RESULTS: Twenty-one children with uveitis were treated with the anti-TNF-alpha agents etanercept (11 patients) and infliximab (13 patients), resulting in 24 treatment courses. All patients had persistently active uveitis despite treatment with at least one standard immunosuppressive drug before the start of anti-TNF-alpha therapy. Six of 21 patients (29%) had idiopathic uveitis. In the other 15 patients, the underlying disease was juvenile idiopathic arthritis in 12 (57%), Behçet disease in two (9%) and sarcoidosis in one (5%). Response to etanercept treatment was good in 27%, moderate in 27% and poor in 45% of patients. Response to infliximab treatment was good in 38%, moderate in 54% and poor in 8% of patients. The difference in the percentage of patients with a moderate or good response was statistically significant (P = 0.0481). We also observed a lower rate of complications, such as new-onset or worsening glaucoma or cataract in the infliximab-treated group.
CONCLUSION: Anti-TNF-alpha treatment was beneficial in a high percentage of patients with childhood uveitis refractory to standard immunosuppressive treatment. Infliximab resulted in better clinical responses with less ocular complications than etanercept.",38,2006-Aug-1

Uveitis is often a chronic disease requiring long-term medical therapy. In this report, we describe a pilot safety and efficacy trial of a novel sustained drug delivery system containing fluocinolone acetonide to treat patients with severe uveitis.
DESIGN: Prospective, noncomparative, interventional case series
PARTICIPANTS: Patients with severe uveitis.
METHODS: Sustained drug delivery devices designed to release fluocinolone acetonide for at least 2.5 years were implanted through the pars plana into the vitreous cavity of seven eyes of five patients. All patients had severe uveitis not well controlled with, or intolerant to, repeated periocular corticosteroid injections, systemic corticosteroids, nonsteroidal immunosuppressive agents, or a combination thereof at the time of device implantation. Before device implantation, patients underwent complete evaluation including history, ophthalmologic examination, fluorescein angiography, visual field testing, and electroretinography. After surgery, patients were reexamined at 1 week, 2 weeks, 4 weeks, and at 1- to 3-month intervals. Visual fields, electroretinograms, and fluorescein angiography were repeated at 3- to 6-month intervals.
MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Preoperative and postoperative visual acuity, ocular inflammation, anti-inflammatory medication use, and intraocular pressure.
RESULTS: Patients had a diagnosis of Behçet's syndrome (two eyes), or idiopathic panuveitis (five eyes, including two with necrotizing retinitis, two with progressive chorioretinitis, and one with iridocyclitis and intermediate uveitis). Patients were observed an average of 10 months (range, 5-19 months). All eyes had stabilized or improved visual acuity after device implantation, and four of seven eyes had an improvement of three lines or more. The mean initial visual acuity, measured by Snellen chart, was 20/207, and the mean final visual acuity was 20/57 (P = 0.02). After surgery, at the final visit, no eye had clinically detectable inflammation, and all seven eyes had a marked reduction in systemic, topical, and periocular anti-inflammatory medication use. Four eyes had increased intraocular pressure 6 weeks to 6 months after device implantation. Intraocular pressure has been controlled on topical medications. No patient experienced intraoperative complications.
CONCLUSIONS: A fluocinolone acetonide sustained drug delivery device is a promising new therapy for the treatment of severe uveitis. Intraocular pressure must be carefully monitored long after device implantation. Based on these data, a randomized study of a larger group of patients is warranted.",38,2000-Nov-1

Raised intraocular pressure is a common and frequently serious complication of anterior uveitis. The milieu of inflammatory cells, the mediators they release, and the corticosteroid therapy used to treat the uveitis can participate in the pathogenesis of uveitic glaucoma. These factors alter the normal anatomic structure of the anterior chamber and angle, influencing aqueous production and outflow. These changes act to disrupt the homeostatic mechanisms of intraocular pressure control. Structural changes in the angle can be acute, such as in secondary angle closure with pupillary block glaucoma, or chronic, such as combined steroid-induced and secondary open angle glaucoma. Management of uveitic glaucoma may be difficult because of the numerous mechanisms involved in its pathogenesis. Diagnostic and therapeutic decisions are guided by careful delineation of the pathophysiology of each individual case. The goal of treatment is to minimize permanent structural alteration of aqueous outflow and to prevent damage to the optic nerve head. This article reviews the pathogenesis of uveitic glaucoma, with specific attention to etiology. Medical and surgical therapies are also discussed, with emphasis on the more recent developments in each category.",38,1997-1-1

To investigate the incidence and prevalence rates of different types of uveitis in children, and to compare them with the rates in adults.
SUBJECTS AND METHODS: For this population-based retrospective study the medical records of all residents of the district of Turku University Hospital with a diagnosis of uveitis seen at the Eye Clinic of Turku University Hospital during the years 1980-1982 and 1988 were reviewed.
RESULTS: A total of 1122 uveitis cases were identified, and 55 (4.9%) of them were children under 16 years. The incidence per 100 000 population per year for all uveitis cases in children was 4.3 (95% confidence interval [CI], 2.2 to 6.4), and the prevalence was 27.9 (95% CI, 17.1 to 38.6), which was significantly lower compared with the rates in adults (p=0.001 for incidence and prevalence). The vast majority of children, 50 (90.9%), had anterior uveitis (AU), and the incidence and prevalence rates of AU were significantly lower than in adults (p=0.001 for incidence and prevalence). Three (5.5%) children had posterior uveitis (PU), but there was no significant difference in the incidence and only marginally significant difference in the prevalence rate of PU in children compared with the rates in adults (p=0.33 for incidence, and p=0.07 for prevalence). Only one case (1.8%) was found with intermediate and one with panuveitis, but no new cases. The commonest diagnostic groups in children were AU associated with juvenile rheumatoid arthritis, idiopathic acute anterior uveitis, and idiopathic chronic anterior uveitis. Toxoplasmic retinochoroiditis was found in all of the PU cases with the incidence 0.3, and the prevalence 1.1, which did not differ significantly from the rates in adults (p=1.0 for incidence, and p= 0.48 for prevalence).
CONCLUSION: Uveitis is rarer in children than in adults. However, in contrast to studies from tertiary referral centers, the distribution of different forms of uveitis in children in this population-based study seems to resemble the distribution in adults.",38,2000-Feb-1

To identify clinical outcomes and treatment patterns of intravitreal dexamethasone implant (Ozurdex; Allergan, Inc) in noninfectious uveitis in the clinical setting.
DESIGN: Multicenter retrospective cohort study.
METHODS: Eighty-two eyes (63 patients) receiving 142 implant injections over 35 months were included. Treatment indication, uveitis diagnosis, visual acuity, intraocular pressure, vitreous haze score, central retinal thickness by optical coherence tomography, phakic status, number of injections, time to reinjection, systemic treatments, and complications data were collected. Time to visual acuity and vitreous haze score improvement as per the Standardization of Uveitis Nomenclature guidelines were also determined.
RESULTS: The probability of visual acuity improvement (≥0.3 logarithm of the minimal angle of resolution units improvement) was 39% at 1 month, 49% at 3 months, 52% at 6 months, and 58% at 12 months. Eyes with baseline vitritis (vitreous haze score ≥+0.5, n = 45) had a probability of vitreous haze score improvement (2-step decrease or change from +0.5 to 0) at 2 weeks of 41%, at 1 month 63%, at 3 months 73%, at 6 months 79%, and at 12 months 88%. In eyes that completed 12-month follow-up (n = 54), 40.7% underwent 2 injections (mean time to second injection of 6.6 ± 1.9 months) and 11.2% required ≥3 injections (mean time to third injection of 11 ± 1.5 months).
CONCLUSIONS: Dexamethasone implant use in uveitis provides favorable visual acuity and vitreous haze score outcomes but requires repeated injections, an important consideration when choosing intraocular treatment as a route to controlling uveitis.",38,2014-Dec-1

Postoperative ocular inflammation following cataract surgery is related to the risk of complications like corneal edema, intraocular pressure spikes, cystoid macular edema, and posterior capsule opacification. The degree of postoperative inflammation following cataract surgery is linked to several surgery-dependent factors such as surgical technique, intraocular lens type, and also patient-dependent factors such as history of inflammatory disease and degree of iris pigmentation. During the past decade, major advances have occurred in cataract surgery techniques, equipment, and pharmacologic strategies that decrease the degree of postoperative inflammation following cataract surgery and reduce patients' risk for inflammation-related complications.

To analyze the referral patterns and clinical features of uveitis in tertiary eye care centers in Turkey.
METHODS: Uveitis services of eight university clinics collected data on uveitis patients who presented during 2004. Data were collected on a form including a questionnaire on socio-demographic and clinical features which were documented at presentation.
RESULTS: A total of 761 patients (1187 eyes) with a mean age of 35.5 years were included in the study. Male to female ratio was 1.04:1. The majority of patients (89.6%) were from an urban population, 53% were referrals and 43% had had uveitis for more than one year. The most common type of uveitis was anterior uveitis (52.5%) followed by panuveitis (28.1%), posterior uveitis (12.7%) and intermediate uveitis (6.7%). In 56.8% of patients an etiological classification was established. The most common etiology was Behcet's disease (32.1%), followed by Fuchs' heterochromic iridocyclitis (5.1%) and ocular toxoplasmosis (4.7%). Among 48 pediatric patients uveitis associated with juvenile idiopathic arthritis and ocular toxoplasmosis both having equal frequencies (12.5%) were the most common diagnosis. These were followed by Behcet's disease with juvenile-onset (10.4%). At the time of presentation, 6.25% of the patients were legally blind (having visual acuity less than 0.1 in the better seeing eye).
CONCLUSION: Compared to the uveitis series reported from other countries, Behcet uveitis was the leading cause of uveitis in this series. Uveitis associated with juvenile idiopathic arthritis and ocular toxoplasmosis were the most common cause of uveitis in childhood. On the other hand, entities like acquired immunodeficiency syndrome-related uveitis, presumed ocular histoplasmosis and Birdshot retinochoroidopathy were rare.",37,2008-1-1

Juvenile idiopathic arthritis-associated uveitis (JIA-U) can lead to poor visual outcomes and impact a child's quality of life (QOL) and function. Our aim is to identify risk markers of JIA-U and examine differences in the QOL of children with JIA and JIA-U.
METHODS: Rheumatology and ophthalmology record reviews and questionnaires were completed every 4-6 months on 287 children with JIA. We collected arthritis, uveitis, and QOL data. We examined data through last study visit.
RESULTS: There were 52/287 (18%) children with JIA-U who were younger at arthritis diagnosis, had oligoarticular persistent JIA, and ANA positive. Confirmed uveitis predictors were age at JIA diagnosis (OR = 0.86) and oligoarticular subtype (OR = 5.92). They had worse vision specific QOL and function, but similar general QOL. Blindness occurred in 17.5% of children but was more common in African American children compared to non-Hispanic Caucasian children ((5/7 (71%) vs. 2/29 (7%), p <0.001) despite a similar uveitis prevalence (22% vs. 16%). Both races had similar complications, although band keratopathy was more frequent in African Americans (75% vs. 15.6%, p = 0.003).
CONCLUSIONS: We confirm young age at JIA diagnosis and the oligoarticular JIA subtype as predictors of uveitis development. Although we were unable to identify predictors of ocular complications or blindness, AA children appeared to have a more severe disease course manifested by increased ocular complications, vision loss and blindness. Potential causes that warrant additional study include underlying disease severity, access to medical care and referral bias. Further investigation of the risk factors for vision-compromising uveitis and its' long-term effects should be conducted in a large racially diverse population.",37,2015-Jun-02

Macular edema (ME) may complicate anterior, intermediate, and posterior uveitis, which may be because of various infectious, neoplastic or autoimmune etiologies. BRB breakdown is involved in the pathogenesis of Uveitic ME (UME). Optical coherence tomography has become a standard tool to confirm the diagnosis of macular thickening, due to its non-invasive, reproducible, and sensitive features. Retinal fluorescein and indocyanine green angiography is helpful to study the macula and screen for associated vasculitis, detect ischemic areas and preretinal, prepapillary or choroidal neovascular complications, and it may provide information about the etiology and be needed to assess the therapeutic response. UME due to an infection or neoplastic infiltration may require a specific treatment. If it remains persistent or occurs in other etiologies, immunomodulatory treatments may be needed. Intravitreal, subconjunctival, or subtenon corticosteroids are widely used. Their local use is contraindicated in glaucoma patients and limited by their short-lasting action. In case of bilateral sight-threatening chronic posterior uveitis, systemic treatments are usually needed, and corticosteroids are used as the standard first-line therapy. In order to reduce the daily steroid dose, immunosuppressive or immunomodulatory agents may be added, some of them being now available intravitreally. Ongoing prospective studies are assessing biotherapies and immunomodulators to determine their safety and efficacy in this indication.",37,2016-Oct-1

Diagnosis of uveitis is difficult. Etiologic investigations should take into account the epidemiology of uveitis and should focus on the most severe forms of the disease and those which can be treated. This study was undertaken to establish recommendations for the diagnosis of uveitis.
METHODS: Recommendations were developed by a multidisciplinary panel of 14 experts, including internists, ophthalmologists, and rheumatologists, and are based on a review of the literature and the results of the ULISSE study, which was the first prospective study to assess the efficacy of a standardized strategy for the etiologic diagnosis of uveitis. The following groups of patients are not included in these recommendations: children, immunocompromised patients, patients with severe retinal vasculitis, and those with specific eye diseases diagnosed by ophthalmologic examination only.
RESULTS: Diagnosis should be guided by the medical history of the patient and physical examination. Serologic screening for syphilis is appropriate in all forms of uveitis. If uveitis is not diagnosed at this stage, investigations oriented by the anatomic characteristics of uveitis are proposed. These consist of assays for HLA-B27 (in unilateral acute anterior non-granulomatous uveitis), serum angiotensin-converting enzyme, interferon-gamma release, chest computed tomography (chronic uveitis), cerebral magnetic resonance imaging and anterior chamber tap with interleukin-10 analysis (intermediate or posterior uveitis in patients >40years-old). Other investigations prescribed in the absence of orientation are usually unhelpful.
CONCLUSIONS: A strategy is proposed for the etiologic diagnosis of uveitis. The benefit of more invasive investigations remains to be determined.",37,2017-Dec-1

Birdshot chorioretinopathy (BCR) is a rare form of chronic, bilateral, posterior uveitis with a distinctive clinical phenotype, and a strong association with HLA-A29. It predominantly affects people in middle age. Given its rarity, patients often encounter delays in diagnosis leading to delays in adequate treatment, and thus risking significant visual loss. Recent advances have helped increase our understanding of the underlying autoimmune mechanisms involved in disease pathogenesis, and new diagnostic approaches such as multimodality imaging have improved our ability to both diagnose and monitor disease activity. Whilst traditional immunosuppressants may be effective in BCR, increased understanding of immune pathways is enabling development of newer treatment modalities, offering the potential for targeted modulation of immune mediators. In this review, we will discuss current understanding of BCR and explore recent developments in diagnosis, monitoring and treatment of this disease.

The diagnosis of ocular toxoplasmosis is based most often on the presence of characteristic clinical findings, which include focal retinochoroiditis, an adjacent or nearby retinochoroidal scar, and moderate to severe vitreous inflammation. However, a variety of less common, ""atypical"" presentations may be unfamiliar to clinicians, delaying both diagnosis and treatment. Patients who are immunocompromised or elderly may, for example, present with large, multiple and/or bilateral lesions. Other unusual manifestations include punctate outer retinal toxoplasmosis, retinal vasculitis, retinal vascular occlusions, rhegmatogenous and serous retinal detachments, a unilateral pigmentary retinopathy mimicking retinitis pigmentosa, neuroretinitis and other forms of optic neuropathy, and scleritis. Although in the past most cases of ocular toxoplasmosis were considered to result from reactivation of a congenital infection, it is now believed that postnatally acquired infection accounts for many cases of this disease. With appropriate use of antiparasitic therapy, the visual prognosis for patients with both typical and atypical forms of ocular toxoplasmosis may be good.",37,2002-Dec-1

Extracellular vesicles (EV), such as exosomes, are important mediators of intercellular communication and have been implicated in modulation of the immune system. We investigated if EV released from retinal pigment epithelium (RPE) modulate immune responses in vitro.
METHODS: Extracellular vesicles were isolated from ARPE-19 cultures stimulated or not with the inflammatory cytokines IL-1β, IFN-γ, and TNF-α. Isolated EV were characterized by nanoparticle flow and Western blot analyses. Retinal pigment epithelium-derived EV were cultured with human peripheral blood mononuclear cells, which were assayed for T-cell proliferation by 3H-thymidine incorporation. Retinal pigment epithelium-derived EV were also independently cultured with enriched lymphocytes or monocytes. Cell phenotype and cell death were evaluated by flow cytometric analysis. Cytokine levels were assayed in culture supernatants by multiplex bead analysis.
RESULTS: The concentration of ARPE-derived EV from cytokine-stimulated cultures was slightly higher than from nonstimulated cultures. The size of EV was approximately 100 nm in both groups. Extracellular vesicles from both nonstimulated and cytokine-stimulated ARPE-19 significantly inhibited T-cell proliferation without affecting T-cell viability. Culture of EV from nonstimulated ARPE-19 with undifferentiated human monocytes induced an immunoregulatory phenotype with a significantly higher percentage of CD14++CD16+ monocytes and upregulation of TGF-β1. Culture of EV from cytokine-stimulated ARPE-19 cells with human monocytes induced upregulation of several proinflammatory cytokines and monocyte death.
CONCLUSIONS: Retinal pigment epithelium cells constitutively secrete EV in the size range of exosomes, with increased release from RPE cells stimulated with inflammatory cytokines. Extracellular vesicles from both nonstimulated and cytokine-stimulated RPE inhibited T-cell stimulation. Extracellular vesicles from nonstimulated ARPE-19 cells promoted an immunoregulatory CD14++CD16+ phenotype in human monocytes, while EV from cytokine-stimulated ARPE-19 cells caused human monocyte death. These findings suggest that RPE cells use EV to induce a downregulatory immune environment under homeostatic conditions. In an inflammatory milieu, RPE-derived EV may mitigate a potentially harmful inflammatory response through killing of monocytes.",37,2016-Aug-01

A review of 28 cases of multifocal choroiditis with vitreous inflammatory cells demonstrates that these patients have chorioretinal scars similar to those in the presumed ocular histoplasmosis syndrome (POHS), but they have a low incidence of positive histoplasmin skin test reactions and calcified granulomata on chest x-ray films. Anterior chamber inflammation is a frequent finding. The epidemiologic background of these patients is different from those with POHS. The subjects in this study were also different from patients with birdshot or vitiliginous choroiditis and acute posterior multifocal placoid pigment epitheliopathy. However, unilateral cases are difficult to distinguish from cases of diffuse unilateral subacute neuroretinitis. While it is possible that a subretinal nematode may have caused some of the unilateral cases in this review, multiple causative agents are likely, including an unidentified agent that causes cross reactions to histoplasmin skin tests.",36,1984-Dec-1

Cannabinoid CB2 receptors mediate immunomodulation. Here, we investigated the effects of CB2 receptor ligands on leukocyte-endothelial adhesion and inflammatory mediator release in experimental endotoxin-induced uveitis (EIU).
EXPERIMENTAL APPROACH: EIU was induced by intraocular injection of lipopolysaccharide (LPS, 20 ng·μL(-1) ). Effects of the CB2 receptor agonist, HU308 (1.5% topical), the CB2 receptor antagonist, AM630 (2.5 mg·kg(-1) i.v.), or a combination of both compounds on leukocyte-endothelial interactions were measured hourly for 6 h in rat iridial vasculature using intravital microscopy. Anti-inflammatory actions of HU308 were compared with those of clinical treatments for uveitis - dexamethasone, prednisolone and nepafenac. Transcription factors (NF-κB, AP-1) and inflammatory mediators (cytokines, chemokines and adhesion molecules) were measured in iris and ciliary body tissue.
KEY RESULTS: Leukocyte-endothelium adherence was increased in iridial microvasculature between 4-6 h after LPS. HU308 reduced this effect after LPS injection and decreased pro-inflammatory mediators: TNF-α, IL-1β, IL-6, CCL5 and CXCL2. AM630 blocked the actions of HU-308, and increased leukocyte-endothelium adhesion. HU-308 decreased levels of the transcription factors NF-κB and AP-1, while AM630 increased levels of NF-κB. Topical treatments with dexamethasone, prednisolone or nepafenac, failed to alter leukocyte adhesion or mitigate LPS-induced increases in inflammatory mediators during the 6 h of EIU.
CONCLUSION AND IMPLICATIONS: Activation of CB2 receptors was anti-inflammatory in a model of acute EIU and involved a reduction in NF-κB, AP-1 and inflammatory mediators. CB2 receptors may be promising drug targets for the development of novel ocular anti-inflammatory agents.

Curcumin, obtained from rhizomes of Curcuma longa, was administered orally to patients suffering from chronic anterior uveitis (CAU) at a dose of 375 mg three times a day for 12 weeks. Of 53 patients enrolled, 32 completed the 12-week study. They were divided into two groups: one group of 18 patients received curcumin alone, whereas the other group of 14 patients, who had a strong PPD reaction, in addition received antitubercular treatment. The patients in both the groups started improving after 2 weeks of treatment. All the patients who received curcumin alone improved, whereas the group receiving antitubercular therapy along with curcumin had a response rate of 86%. Follow up of all the patients for the next 3 years indicated a recurrence rate of 55% in the first group and of 36% in the second group. Four of 18 (22%) patients in the first group and 3 of 14 patients (21%) in the second group lost their vision in the follow up period due to various complications in the eyes, e.g. vitritis, macular oedema, central venous block, cataract formation, glaucomatous optic nerve damage etc. None of the patients reported any side effect of the drug. The efficacy of curcumin and recurrences following treatment are comparable to corticosteroid therapy which is presently the only available standard treatment for this disease. The lack of side effects with curcumin is its greatest advantage compared with corticosteroids. A double blind multi-centric clinical trial with this drug in CAU is highly desirable to further validate the results of the present study.",36,1999-Jun-1

Ipilimumab, a monoclonal antibody directed against the immune protein cytotoxic T-lymphocyte antigen-4 (CTLA-4), characteristically induces side effects called ""immune-related adverse events"" (IRAE). Although ophthalmic involvement is rare, we report 7 cases of eye and orbit complications related to ipilimumab therapy.
METHODS: We performed a retrospective review of patients with metastatic melanoma who developed ipilimumab-related ocular or orbital inflammation who were seen at our institutions.
RESULTS: Seven patients were identified: 4 patients had orbital inflammation, 2 had uveitis, and 1 had peripheral ulcerative keratitis. Four patients developed inflammation after the second ipilimumab infusion, 2 after the third infusion and 1 after the first infusion. All 4 patients with orbital inflammation were treated with systemic corticosteroids. Two patients with uveitis were treated with topical steroids, but were also treated with systemic corticosteroids for other IRAE, including colitis and hypophysitis. The patient with keratitis was treated with topical corticosteroids alone with resolution of inflammation. All 7 patients discontinued ipilimumab therapy, 5 due to systemic IRAE and 2 due to tumor progression. Five of 7 patients had tumor progression on ipilimumab therapy.
CONCLUSIONS: Ocular and orbital inflammation may occur in patients with metastatic melanoma receiving ipilimumab, is frequently accompanied by other IRAEs, and resolves with corticosteroid treatment, often leaving no long-term sequelae.",36,2016-1-1

To estimate the risk of structural ocular complications and loss of visual acuity (VA) in cases of Behçet disease (BD) and to evaluate potential risk and protective factors for these events.
DESIGN: Retrospective cohort study.
METHODS: A total of 168 consecutive patients with BD-associated ocular inflammation treated at five academic center ocular inflammation subspecialty practices were included. Clinical data for these patients were ascertained by standardized chart review. Main outcome measures included VA, structural ocular complications of inflammation, and intraocular pressure (IOP).
RESULTS: Over a median follow-up of 1.05 years, the incidence of specific structural complications and IOP disturbances were common: the incidence rate of any ocular complication was 0.45 per eye-year (EY). Rates of loss of VA to 20/50 or worse and to 20/200 or worse were 0.12 per EY and 0.09 per EY, respectively. Risk factors for loss of VA during follow-up were persistent inflammatory activity, presence of posterior synechiae, presence of hypotony, and presence of elevated IOP. In a time-dependent analysis, current activity of ocular inflammation was associated with an increased risk of loss of VA to 20/50 or worse (relative risk [RR], 2.45; 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.1 to 5.5; P = .03) and to 20/200 or worse (RR, 2.67; 95% CI, 1.2 to 5.8; P = .01).
CONCLUSIONS: Loss of VA and occurrence of ocular complications were common in patients with ocular inflammation associated with BD, even with aggressive therapy. Ongoing inflammation during follow-up, presence or occurrence of posterior synechiae, hypotony, and elevated IOP were associated with an increased risk of loss of VA.",36,2008-Dec-1

Aqueous flare and cells are the two inflammatory parameters of anterior chamber inflammation resulting from disruption of the blood-ocular barriers. When examined with the slit lamp, measurement of intraocular inflammation remains subjective with considerable intra- and interobserver variations. Laser flare cell photometry is an objective quantitative method that enables accurate measurement of these parameters with very high reproducibility. Laser flare photometry allows detection of subclinical alterations in the blood-ocular barriers, identifying subtle pathological changes that could not have been recorded otherwise. With the use of this method, it has been possible to compare the effect of different surgical techniques, surgical adjuncts, and anti-inflammatory medications on intraocular inflammation. Clinical studies of uveitis patients have shown that flare measurements by laser flare photometry allowed precise monitoring of well-defined uveitic entities and prediction of disease relapse. Relationships of laser flare photometry values with complications of uveitis and visual loss further indicate that flare measurement by laser flare photometry should be included in the routine follow-up of patients with uveitis.",36,2010-Oct-1

To determine whether the use of ultra wide-field imaging changes the management or determination of disease activity in patients with noninfectious posterior uveitis.
DESIGN: Prospective, observational case series.
METHODS: setting: Divisions of Retina and Ocular Immunology at single academic medical center. patient population: Total of 43 patients with noninfectious posterior uveitis seen by 4 investigators at the Wilmer Eye Institute. procedures: Each patient underwent standard clinical examination, followed by ultra wide-field scanning laser ophthalmoscope (SLO) imaging and angiography. Investigators successively determined disease activity and management decisions based on clinical examination, examination plus simulated 30- or 60-degree fluorescein angiography (FA) (obtained by physically narrowing the field of view of the wide-field images), examination plus ultra wide-field SLO images, and examination plus wide-field FA. main outcome measures: The primary outcome was the percentage of patients whose management changed based on the availability of wide-field imaging, compared with standard examination and imaging. The secondary outcome was detection of disease activity with and without wide-angle imaging.
RESULTS: Management was altered in 7 of 43 patients (16%) based on examination and limited FA, whereas 21 of 43 patients (48%) had management change with the use of the ultra wide-field imaging and angiography (P < .001). Disease activity was detected in 22 of 43 patients (51%) based on examination and simulated conventional imaging, and in 27 of 43 (63%) with wide-field imaging (P = .27).
CONCLUSIONS: The index study, with several design limitations, has suggested that ultra wide-field imaging may alter management decisions compared to standard-of-care imaging and clinical examination. Additional studies, including longitudinal evaluations, are needed to determine whether these findings, or the subsequent management alterations, may improve patient outcomes.",36,2012-Nov-1

To investigate gut microbiota composition and fecal metabolic phenotype in patients with acute anterior uveitis.
METHODS: Fecal DNA was extracted from 78 fecal samples (38 acute anterior uveitis (AAU) patients and 40 family members of patients or sex- and age-matched healthy controls) and then sequenced by high-throughput 16S rDNA analysis. Gas chromatographic mass spectrometry (GC-MS) based metabolomics was performed on 60 fecal samples (30 AAU patients and 30 healthy controls).
RESULTS: A significant difference was observed in beta diversity between AAU patients and healthy controls. Eight genera including Roseburia were reduced in AAU patients, and Veillonella was increased in AAU patients as compared with healthy controls. Significance was however lost after false discovery rate (FDR) correction. The expression of seven fecal metabolites including 6-deoxy-D-glucose 1, linoleic acid, N-Acetyl-beta-D-mannosamine 3, shikimic acid, azelaic acid, isomaltose 1 and palmitoleic acid was increased in AAU patients. Linoleic acid showed a significant correlation with Roseburia and Veillonella according to Spearman correlation analysis.
CONCLUSIONS: Our results did not reveal a difference in gut microbiota composition, but did show that the fecal metabolic phenotype in AAU patients was significantly different from healthy controls.",36,2018-Mar-01

Behçet's disease is a multisystem vasculitis of unknown origin. Standard treatment mainly comprises systemic immunosuppressive agents. Ocular involvement, mostly posterior uveitis with retinal vasculitis, leads to blindness in 20-50% of the involved eyes within 5 years. The efficacy of interferon alfa-2a was studied in patients with sight threatening posterior uveitis or retinal vasculitis.
METHODS: 50 patients were included in this open, non-randomised, uncontrolled prospective study. Recombinant human interferon alfa-2a (rhIFNalpha-2a) was applied at a dose of 6 million units subcutaneously daily. Dose reduction was performed according to a decision tree until discontinuation. Disease activity was evaluated every 2 weeks by the Behçet's disease activity scoring system and the uveitis scoring system.
RESULTS: Response rate of the ocular manifestations was 92% (three non-responder, one incomplete response). Mean visual acuity rose significantly from 0.56 to 0.84 at week 24 (p<0.0001). Posterior uveitis score of the affected eyes fell by 46% every week (p<0.001). Remission of retinal inflammation was achieved by week 24. Mean Behçet's disease activity score fell from 5.8 to 3.3 at week 24 and further to 2.8 at week 52. After a mean observation period of 36.4 months (range 12-72), 20 patients (40%) are off treatment and disease free for 7-58 months (mean 29.5). In the other patients maintenance IFN dosage is three million units three times weekly.
CONCLUSIONS: rhIFNalpha-2a is effective in ocular Behçet's disease, leading to significant improvement of vision and complete remission of ocular vasculitis in the majority of the patients.",36,2003-Apr-1

Macrophages infiltrating an inflamed or injured tissue undergo development of coordinated sets of properties that contribute to tissue damage, repair, and remodeling. The purpose of this study was to determine whether macrophages isolated from normal or inflamed retina are programmed to a distinct set of properties and to examine whether the development of experimental autoimmune uveoretinitis (EAU) affects macrophage function.
METHODS: EAU was induced in Lewis rats, and a retina-derived macrophage-enriched population was generated by density centrifugation during the prepeak, peak, and resolution phases of the disease. Cell surface phenotype was assessed by two- and three-color flow cytometry, and function was determined in vitro by nitric oxide (NO) production, with or without further cytokine stimulation or by immunohistochemistry to determine expression of beta-glucuronidase, nitric oxide synthase (NOS)-2, and nitrotyrosine.
RESULTS: Myeloid-derived cells from normal retina were programmed similar to TGF-beta-stimulated uncommitted bone-marrow-derived macrophages (BMDMs). Contrary to BMDM behavior, retina-isolated macrophages displayed distinct properties and phenotype at different phases of the disease course and remained resistant throughout, to further cytokine challenge in vitro. During peak disease, retina-isolated macrophages had characteristics of IFN-gamma/TNF-alpha primed cells (nitrotyrosine positive and NO producing). Despite equivalent numbers of macrophages during resolution, their function reverted to characteristics of TGF-beta primed cells (beta-glucuronidase positive).
CONCLUSIONS: Resident retinal myeloid-derived cells are primed and are resistant to further cytokine stimulation, and, similar to macrophages derived during EAU recovery, behave operationally as though TGF-beta primed. During peak inflammation, infiltrating macrophages adapt to concurrent hierarchical Th1 T-cell response (IFN-gamma/TNF-alpha), generating NO. The results provide evidence of in vivo programming of macrophages within the retina.",36,2002-Jul-1

Uveitis is composed of a diverse group of disease entities, which in total has been estimated to cause approximately 10% of blindness. Uveitis is broadly classified into anterior, intermediate, posterior and panuveitis based on the anatomical involvement of the eye. Anterior uveitis is, however, the commonest form of uveitis with varying incidences reported in worldwide literature. Anterior uveitis can be very benign to present with but often can lead to severe morbidity if not treated appropriately. The present article will assist ophthalmologists in accurately diagnosing anterior uveitis, improving the quality of care rendered to patients with anterior uveitis, minimizing the adverse effects of anterior uveitis, developing a decision-making strategy for management of patients at risk of permanent visual loss from anterior uveitis, informing and educating patients and other healthcare practitioners about the visual complications, risk factors, and treatment options associated with anterior uveitis.",36,2010-1-1

To identify the distribution and characteristics of new uveitis referrals to a tertiary eye care center in Tehran.
METHODS: A three-year prospective study was carried out to obtain information on 544 new patients referred with uveitis. A complete ophthalmologic examination was performed in all cases; a routine set of tests and an additional battery of directed workup were conducted when indicated.
RESULTS: Mean age was 32.3 years. There was no significant sex predominance. The most common forms of uveitis were anterior (38.4%) vs. other anatomical forms, chronic (62.1%) vs. acute (28.3%), nongranulomatous (85.5%) vs. granulomatous (14.5%), and noninfectious (83.5%) vs. infectious (16.5%). With regard to etiology, 45.5% were idiopathic, 19.9% were due to specific ocular disease, and 37.3% were associated with systemic disorders. Behcet's disease was the most common noninfectious disease and toxoplasmosis the most common infectious entity. The most prevalent causes were idiopathic, Fuchs' heterochromic iridocylitis, and seronegative spondyloarthropathies in anterior uveitis; toxoplasmosis, Eales disease, and toxocariasis in posterior uveitis; idiopathic, sarcoidosis, and multiple sclerosis in intermediate uveitis; and, finally, Behcet's disease, idiopathic, and Vogt-Koyanagi-Harada syndrome in panuveitis. The most frequent cause in patients under 16 years of age was pars planitis. Over 80% of the patients belonged to middle-to-upper socioeconomic classes. Uveitis significantly affected patients' lives in 63.1% of the cases.
CONCLUSION: Although the current study was performed at a referral center, it may reflect to some extent the different distribution of uveitis in Iran and probably other Middle Eastern countries. Some entities such as presumed ocular histoplasmosis were not found, cytomegalovirus retinitis and birdshot chorioretinopathy were extremely rare, and HLA-B27-associated iridocyclitis was less commonly observed. In contrast, Behcet's disease, Fuchs' heterochromic iridocyclitis, Eales disease, and toxocariasis were among the more prevalent entities.",36,2004-Dec-1

To devise methods for unequivocal identification of activated retinal microglia in experimental autoimmune uveoretinitis (EAU) and to investigate their role in the development of EAU.
METHODS: A group of Lewis rats underwent optic nerve axotomy with the application of N-4-(4-didecylaminostyryl)-N methylpyridinium iodide (4Di-10ASP) at the axotomy site. On days 3, 14, and 38 after axotomy, the rats were killed, the eyes were enucleated, and the retinas were stained for OX42. Another group of such axotomized rats were immunized with S-antigen peptide and were killed on days 7 through 12 after the injection with peptide. The enucleated eyes were stained for OX42 and examined by confocal microscope. After axotomy, bone marrow (Y-->X) chimeric rats were injected with S-antigen peptide and were killed on days 10 and 12 after injection. The retinas were evaluated by PCR with Y-specific primers. Finally, a group of axotomized rats was injected with the S-antigen peptide and killed on days 6, 8, 9, and 10 after injection. Their enucleated eyes were examined for microglial expression of TNFalpha and for generation of peroxynitrite.
RESULTS: In the axotomized, non-EAU eyes, 4Di-10ASP-labeled ganglion cells were detectable on days 3 and 14, and 4Di-10ASP-containing OX42-positive cells (microglia) were found in the nerve fiber and other inner retinal layers on days 14 and 38. The S-antigen peptide-injected rats showed migration of the microglia (4Di-10ASP-positive and OX42-positive) to the photoreceptor cell layer on day 9, and these cells increased in number at this site on day 10. No macrophages (OX42-positive and 4Di-10ASP-negative) were present at this early stage of EAU, but such cells appeared in the retina on days 11 and 12. PCR of the chimeric EAU retinas showed an absence of the Y chromosome-amplified product on day 10, but the presence of this product was detected on day 12. The expression of TNFalpha and generation of peroxynitrite were noted in the migrated microglia at the photoreceptor cell layer on days 9 and 10 of EAU.
CONCLUSIONS: In the early phase of EAU, the microglia migrate to the photoreceptor cell layer where they generate TNFalpha and peroxynitrite. Such microglial migration and activation take place before infiltration of the macrophages. These findings indicate a novel pathogenic mechanism of EAU, in which retinal microglia may initiate retinitis with subsequent recruitment of circulation-derived phagocytes, leading to the amplification of uveoretinitis.",35,2003-Jan-1

This study examines whether genetic susceptibility vs genetic resistance to experimental autoimmune uveoretinitis (EAU) are connected to a predisposition to mount a Th1-dominated (IFN-gamma high, IL-4 low) vs a Th2-dominated (IL-4 high, lFN-gamma low) response. Lewis rats developed disease with high incidence after immunization with the uveitogenic peptide R16, whereas F344 rats were resistant. Primed lymph node cells from both strains proliferated in culture in response to R16. However, while the Lewis cultures transferred EAU to syngeneic recipients, those of F344 did not. The Lewis cultures produced substantially more IFN-gamma mRNA and protein in response to R16, than did those of F344. Both strains made low levels of IL-10 mRNA and IL-4 mRNA. Unlike the primary cultures, long-term (R16-specific) T cell lines derived from each of the strains transferred EAU equally well to their respective recipients, and produced similar, high levels of IFN-gamma mRNA and protein. Treatment of F344 with Bordetella pertussis toxin concurrently with immunization abrogated its resistance, enhanced Ag-specific IFN-gamma production in culture, and yielded a primed cell population capable of transferring EAU. Conversely, immunization of Lewis rats with R16 in IFA induced little or no disease; the primed cells produced minimal amounts of IFN-gamma and did not transfer EAU. However, addition of IL-12 into the culture resulted in a highly pathogenic, IFN-gamma-producing cell population. We conclude that genetic susceptibility to ocular autoimmunity in this model is connected to an elevated Th1 response. Genetic resistance, however, does not seem to involve an elevated Th2 response, but rather an inhibited development of Th1-like effector cells.",35,1996-Sep-15

Experimental autoimmune uveitis (EAU) in its several variants represents human autoimmune uveitis and has been instrumental in obtaining insights into the basic mechanisms of disease. Studies have uncovered that in addition to CD4+ Th1 cells, uveitis can be induced also by CD8+ T cells. Antibodies may have a secondary role after the blood-retinal barrier has been broken. The role in uveitis of a recently discovered IL-17-producing effector T cell type, Th17, is being intensively studied. Th17 cells elicit EAU, can be found in uveitic eyes along with Th1 cells, and are dominant in some types of EAU. In other types of EAU, Th1 cells have a dominant role. The dominant effector type is at least in part determined by conditions under which initial exposure to self-antigen occurs. These findings shed light on the heterogeneity of human disease and may ultimately help to develop better and more rational treatment strategies for human uveitis.",35,2008-Apr-1

To evaluate the efficacy of measuring subfoveal choroidal thickness in monitoring uveitis activity before and after treatment with infliximab in patients with Behçet's disease (BD)-associated uveitis.
METHODS: Thirteen patients with BD (23 eyes) were selected for this retrospective observational case study. Subfoveal choroidal thickness was measured during active and remission phases of uveitis by enhanced depth imaging-spectral domain optical coherence tomography (EDI-OCT). In five patients (10 eyes), choroidal thickness was assessed at weeks 0, 2, 6 and 14 after the initiation of infliximab treatment.
RESULTS: Accompanied by excessive dye leakage from choroidal vessels on indocyanine green angiography, dilation of choroidal vessels was observed in the active phase of uveitis by EDI-OCT and the choroidal thickness was significantly greater than that in the remission phase. Treatment with infliximab significantly reduced the choroidal thickness from week 2 after the first infusion, and the reduced choroidal thickness was maintained thereafter. No correlation was found between choroidal thickness and best corrected visual acuity converted to logarithm of the minimum angle of resolution, but choroidal thickness correlated significantly with anterior and posterior ocular inflammation scores.
CONCLUSIONS: This study indicates that measurement of subfoveal choroidal thickness by EDI-OCT is useful for evaluating the activity of uveitis and the therapeutic efficacy in patients with BD.",35,2014-Nov-1

To compare a single infusion of the anti-TNF antibody infliximab vs CSs for acute panuveitis attacks in Behçet's disease (BD).
METHODS: A prospective, observational study of patients with panuveitis, who received either an infliximab infusion (5 mg/kg, 19 eyes) or high-dose methylprednisolone intravenously (1 g/day for 3 days, 8 eyes), or intra-vitreal triamcinolone acetonide (4 mg, 8 eyes) at attack's onset. Baseline maintenance therapy remained unchanged during the following 30 days. Visual acuity, anterior chamber cells, vitreous cells and inflammation of the posterior eye segment were assessed at baseline and at Days 1, 7, 14 and 29 (±1) post-treatment.
RESULTS: While no significant differences were noted between i.v. and intra-vitreal CSs, infliximab was faster than CSs in decreasing total ocular inflammation scores and fundus inflammation scores (P = 0.01 and P < 0.0001 for treatment × time(2) interaction, respectively, using generalized estimating equation analysis). Independently of time, infliximab was superior to CSs in clearing retinal vasculitis (P < 0.003), as well as in resolution of retinitis (P = 0.008) and cystoid macular oedema (P < 0.007). Moreover, a faster regression of cystoid macular oedema was observed with infliximab compared with CSs (P < 0.03). The beneficial effects of the three treatment modalities on visual acuity were comparable from baseline to the end of follow-up. No side effects were noted with infliximab or methylprednisolone, whereas intra-vitreal triamcinolone acetonide caused ocular hypertension in four of the eight eyes, requiring surgical intervention in two.
CONCLUSION: A single infusion of infliximab should always be considered, even as an adjunct therapy, for the control of acute panuveitis attacks in BD.",35,2011-Mar-1

Uveitis is underappreciated as a sight-threatening cause of blindness. There are two broad causative classes of uveitis: infectious and non-infectious. Non-infectious uveitis is considered a prototypical autoimmune disorder based mainly on data from experimental models in the mouse. Several different experimental models exist that reflect the different types of uveitis in man (anterior, intermediate, and posterior uveitis). These models have demonstrated that uveitis is predominantly a Th1/Th17 mediated disease, although innate immune cells play a significant role both in induction of disease and in tissue damage. Most experimental models of uveitis rely on activation of the innate immune system by use of adjuvants that activate a range of pathogen recognition receptors (PRRs). This begs the question of the underlying role of initial and/or persistent infection, including latent infection, in immune-mediated uveitis in which active infection cannot be demonstrated. This further raises the possibility of pathogenic mechanisms such as antigenic cross-reactivity and molecular mimicry. Alternatively, residual/latent antigen from infectious agents may act as ""endogenous"" adjuvants for induction of immune reactions to damaged/altered self antigen, suggesting a commonality in pathogenesis for both infectious and non-infectious uveitis in man.",35,2013-Feb-1

This study aimed to evaluate the role of interleukin (IL)-1 inhibitors anakinra (ANA) and canakinumab (CAN) in the treatment of Behçet's disease (BD)-related uveitis. Multicenter retrospective observational study includes 19 consecutive BD patients (31 affected eyes) received treatment with anti-IL-1 agents. Data were analyzed at baseline and at 3 and 12 months. The primary endpoint is the reduction of ocular inflammatory flares (OIF). The secondary endpoints are improvement of best corrected visual acuity (BCVA); reduction of macular thickness defined by optical coherence tomography (OCT) and of vasculitis identified with fluorescein angiography (FA); evaluation of statistically significant differences between patients treated with IL-1 inhibitors as monotherapy, subjects also administered with disease modifying anti-rheumatic drugs (DMARDs) and/or corticosteroids as well as between patients administered with IL-1 inhibitors as first line biologic treatment and those previously treated with TNF-α inhibitors. At 12 months, OIF significantly decreased from 200 episodes/100 patients/year to 48.87 episodes/100 patients/year (p < 0.0001). The frequency of retinal vasculitis identified by FA significantly decreased between baseline and 3- and 12-month follow-up visits (p < 0.0001 and p = 0.001, respectively). OIF rate was significantly higher in patients co-administered with DMARDs (81.8 episodes/100 patients/year) than in patients undergoing IL-1 inhibitors as monotherapy (0.0 episodes/100 patients/year) (p = 0.03). No differences were identified on the basis of corticosteroid use and between patients administered with IL-1 inhibitors as first line biologic approach or second line. Steroid dosage was significantly decreased at 12-month visit compared to baseline (p = 0.02). Treatment with IL-1 inhibitors is effective in the management of BD-related uveitis and provides a long-term control of ocular inflammation in refractory and long-lasting cases.",35,2017-Jan-1

To evaluate the interobserver agreement among uveitis experts on the diagnosis of the specific uveitic disease.
DESIGN: Interobserver agreement analysis.
METHODS: Five committees, each comprised of 9 individuals and working in parallel, reviewed cases from a preliminary database of 25 uveitic diseases, collected by disease, and voted independently online whether the case was the disease in question or not. The agreement statistic, κ, was calculated for the 36 pairwise comparisons for each disease, and a mean κ was calculated for each disease. After the independent online voting, committee consensus conference calls, using nominal group techniques, reviewed all cases not achieving supermajority agreement (>75%) on the diagnosis in the online voting to attempt to arrive at a supermajority agreement.
RESULTS: A total of 5766 cases for the 25 diseases were evaluated. The overall mean κ for the entire project was 0.39, with disease-specific variation ranging from 0.23 to 0.79. After the formalized consensus conference calls to address cases that did not achieve supermajority agreement in the online voting, supermajority agreement overall was reached on approximately 99% of cases, with disease-specific variation ranging from 96% to 100%.
CONCLUSIONS: Agreement among uveitis experts on diagnosis is moderate at best but can be improved by discussion among them. These data suggest the need for validated and widely used classification criteria in the field of uveitis.",35,2018-Feb-1

By allowing one to detect fluorescence beyond the retinal pigment epithelium, indocyanine green angiography (ICGA) has made it possible to analyse the choroidal vessels. Our aim was to characterize choroidal vasculitis in posterior uveitis using ICGA.
METHODS: Charts of active posterior uveitis patients with a specific diagnosis seen in the different centers participating in the study who had undergone dual fluorescein and ICG angiography were reviewed. The type of inflammatory involvement of the choroidal circulation at entry and the treatment response on follow-up angiograms were analysed.
RESULTS: A total of 129 patients were analysed. Choroidal vasculitis could be subdivided into two main patterns: (1) primary inflammatory choriocapillaropathy and (2) stromal inflammatory vasculopathy. The first pattern consisted of hypofluorescent areas up to the late phase of angiography characteristic for choriocapillaris non-perfusion and included entities such as multiple evanescent white dot syndrome (MEWDS), acute posterior multifocal placoid pigment epitheliopathy (APMPPE), multifocal choroiditis (MC), ampiginous choroidopathy and serpiginous choroidopathy. The second pattern consisted of fuzzy indistinct appearance of vessels in the intermediate angiographic phase and diffuse choroidal hyperfluorescence in the late phase indicating inflammatory vasculopathy of larger choroidal vessels. This pattern was found in all cases of active Vogt-Koyanagi-Harada disease, ocular sarcoidosis and tuberculosis and birdshot chorioretinopathy. In Behçet's uveitis of recent onset, choriocapillaris perfusion delay and fuzzy choroidal vessels without diffuse late choroidal hyperfluorescence was found. In posterior scleritis, enlargement of vorticous veins was an additionnal ICGA sign. Stromal inflammatory vasculopathy always responded to anti-inflammatory therapy. A third group of patients with severe retinal or choroidal inflammation presented with associated secondary inflammatory choriocapillaropathy angiographically identical to the primary involvement.
CONCLUSIONS: ICGA allowed the hitherto impossible characterization of inflammatory involvement of the choroidal vessels, showing either predominant inflammation of the choriocapillaris or predominant inflammation of the stromal choroidal vessels with or without secondary choriocapillaritis. ICGA will be indispensable for the correct evaluation and follow-up of posterior inflammation with suspected choroidal involvement.",35,2002-Apr-1

Posner-Schlossman syndrome, or glaucomatocyclitic crisis, is a unilateral ocular condition characterized by recurrent attacks of nongranulomatous anterior uveitis and raised intraocular pressure that can result in chronic secondary glaucoma. This relatively rare disease is most likely the result of recurrent cytomegalovirus infection and affects predominantly middle-aged males. Diagnosis is largely clinical, with aqueous and blood sampling aiding the identification of any underlying infectious cause. Successful disease management is often achieved by topical treatment, although systemic therapy and even surgical intervention may be required. We discuss our current understanding of Posner-Schlossman syndrome, from its pathophysiology through to recommended treatment options.",34,2017-1-1

PMID: 16264346
This update aims to summarize the current knowledge on Fuchs' uveitis syndrome and review publications in the last 10 years. Theories on the pathogenesis and etiology of Fuchs' uveitis syndrome are revisited and the management of cataract and glaucoma is updated to reflect recent surgical change.
RECENT FINDINGS: Retrospective reviews have highlighted that patients with Fuchs' uveitis syndrome are often initially misdiagnosed. Studies comparing local inflammatory mediators and cell types have found differences in Fuchs' uveitis syndrome, but the differences in steroid response and degree of inflammation remain poorly understood. Local production of antibodies to rubella has been recently reported in the aqueous of all patients with Fuchs' uveitis syndrome and no controls. Excellent visual outcomes from phacoemulsification have been reported with reduced complications compared with extracapsular cataract extraction.
SUMMARY: Although a single etiological agent and a sensitive laboratory test for the diagnosis of Fuchs' uveitis syndrome is alluring, the diagnosis of Fuchs' uveitis syndrome remains clinical, at least for now. Phacoemulsification has increased the safety of cataract extraction, and the use of intraocular lens is generally safe. The ideal lens material and design are not yet known, but silicone lenses may be best avoided. Glaucoma is often resistant to treatment and should actively be screened for in patients with Fuchs' uveitis syndrome. Medical and surgical treatment for reducing intraocular pressure should be especially aggressive in these patients. Vitrectomy appears to be safe in patients with visually significant vitreous opacification.",34,2005-Dec-1

To better characterize posterior uveitis, vitreous samples from 15 patients were subjected to antibody arrays, and the expression levels of 200 human cytokines were evaluated. Expression was analyzed by 1-way analysis of variance (significance at P < .01), unsupervised cluster algorithm, and pathway analysis.
OBSERVATIONS: Unbiased clustering of patients, based on their cytokine expression profile, suggested that particular protein networks and molecular pathways are altered in various forms of uveitis. Expression of interleukin 23 (IL-23), IL-1 receptor I (IL-1RI), IL-17R, tissue inhibitors of metalloproteinase 1 and 2 (TIMP-1 and TIMP-2), insulinlike growth factor-binding protein 2 (IGFBP-2), nerve growth factor (b-NGF), platelet-derived growth factor receptor β polypeptide (PDGFRb), bone morphogenic protein 4 (BMP-4), and stem cell factor (SCF) constituted a common cytokine signature in the vitreous of patients with uveitis. In 1 patient with progressive, idiopathic visual loss, this last-line analysis implicated retinal autoimmunity, a diagnosis that was validated when her serum sample was found to contain antibodies to S-arrestin, a retinal protein and potent cause of autoimmune retinal degeneration.
CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: The analysis identifies a common cytokine signature for posterior uveitis and guides the diagnosis of a patient with idiopathic uveitis. Personalized treatment reversed the visual loss, illustrating how proteomic tools may individualize therapy.",34,2016-Apr-1

S-antigen, an organ-specific substance isolated from the retinal photoreceptor region, was shown to be a potent agent for the induction of experimental autoimmune uveitis. S-antigen and other ocular antigens were tested for their ability to induce blast transformation of lymphocytes from patients with a variety of ocular inflammatory diseases. Lymphocytes from 22% of patients tested manifested a positive memory response to the S-antigen prepared from bovine eyes. Responses to human S-antigen paralleled those found with the bovine. All of those with a positive response had active or inactive retinal lesions. Some posterior uveitis patients responded to crude retinal extracts but not to S-antigen, indicating the possible role of other retinal antigens still to be purified. Control subjects did not manifest a positive immune response to the S-antigen, nor did patients with anterior uveitis. Possibly, these responses play some role in the pathogenesis of the disease.",34,1980-Feb-1

Uveitis is the most common ophthalmological finding in the practice of rheumatology and clinical immunology. The condition is frequently idiopathic and defined by the inflammatory status of the uvea, the part of the middle eye that includes the iris, ciliary body and choroid. Anterior uveitis involves the iris and ciliary body, while the posterior form is limited to the retina and choroid. Both forms represent indications for an urgent evaluation by an ophthalmologist as untreated cases may cause blindness. Anterior uveitis is associated with the HLA-B27 allele and is a classification criterion for seronegative arthritis forms such as ankylosing spondylitis, psoriatic arthropathy, arthritis associated with Crohn's disease and ulcerative colitis, and reactive arthritis. Posterior uveitis is associated with Behcet's disease and HLA-B51. The clinical suspicion is raised by self-reported symptoms in the case of anterior involvement and floaters for posterior uveitis while the diagnosis, in the absence of established criteria, is made by an experienced ophthalmologist.",34,2014-1-1

To present our preliminary experience with JAK inhibitors in treating patients affected by juvenile idiopathic arthritis (JIA) and associated uveitis. Case series. Four consecutive patients with long-term history of juvenile idiopathic arthritis and severe associated uveitis were included in the study. Indication for treatment with JAK inhibitors was uncontrolled arthritis and/or uveitis despite different treatments with conventional and biologic disease modifying antirheumatic drugs (DMARDs). While on treatment with JAK inhibitors, namely, baricitinib (three cases) and tofacitinib (one case), all our patients showed improvement of uveitis defined as a reduction of intraocular inflammation according to Standardized Uveitis Nomenclature criteria. However, we observed a different response to treatment between the uveitis and the articular disease, as the latter did not respond as favorably as the former. Overall, the treatment was well tolerated by all patients and no ocular discomfort, ocular side effects, or allergic reactions were registered. JAK inhibitors may provide a new valuable treatment option in the therapeutic armamentarium for patients affected with JIA-associated uveitis, particularly in those refractory cases that are not adequately responding to conventional or biologic DMARDs.Key Points• A subset of patients with JIA uveitis either remain unresponsive or experience loss of efficacy• JAK inhibitors may provide a new valuable treatment option in JIA patients with uveitis• The safety profile was good with no occurrence of systemic side effects.",34,2020-Mar-1

Uveitis is a term which encompasses many clinical syndromes which would appear to be discrete entities. Both clinically and experimentally, the separation of uveitis affecting only the anterior segment from that affecting the posterior segment has a sound pathogenetic basis. However, clear distinctions among the various forms of endogenous posterior uveitis are more difficult to maintain in the light of evidence from experimental models of autoimmune uveitis (EAU). EAU can be induced by a variety of retinal antigens and each antigen has been shown to induce somewhat different forms of EAU, depending on such factors as dose of antigen, species and strains of animal model, and the type(s) of adjuvant used. However, within each model a similar spectrum of uveoretinal responses can be induced by each antigen suggesting that the pathogenetic mechanisms are probably similar also. In addition, if these models are analogous to human disease, then each clinical entity within this apparently heterogeneous group of clinical posterior uveitis syndromes may represent one aspect of a general organ-specific uveoretinal response to autoantigens.",34,1990-1-1

To describe the effects of infliximab on refractory uveoretinitis in patients with Behçet disease during the first year of treatment.
METHODS: Data were collected prospectively at 8 tertiary uveitis centers. Safety was analyzed in 63 patients. Efficacy was analyzed in 50 patients, after exclusion of those who had received infliximab for various reasons before the study.
RESULTS: Eighty-nine percent (56 of 63) of the patients were male, with 70% (44 of 63) of the patients aged 25 to 44 years. The safety analysis demonstrated that 34 episodes of adverse effects occurred in 46% (29 of 63) of patients during 1 year, including 3 episodes of infusion reactions. No adverse effects were deemed serious. The efficacy analysis at 1 year showed that uveoretinitis had improved in 69% (33 of 48), had improved somewhat in 23% (11 of 48), was unchanged in 8% (4 of 48), and had worsened in no patients. The mean number of ocular attacks per 6-month period decreased from 2.66 at baseline to 0.44 during months 1 through 6 of infliximab therapy and to 0.79 during months 7 through 12. Forty-four percent (21 of 48) of patients had no ocular attacks during the 1-year period. Efficacy was best for patients with uveoretinitis duration of less than 5 years. The mean best-corrected visual acuity improved logarithm of the minimum angle of resolution from 0.736 at the first infliximab infusion to 0.616 at the end of 1 year (P = .01).
CONCLUSIONS: Infliximab treatment for Behçet disease uveoretinitis was well tolerated, with nonserious adverse effects occurring in about half of the patients. At the end of 1 year, uveoretinitis had improved or improved somewhat in 92% (44 of 48) of patients, accompanied by improvement in the mean visual acuity.",34,2012-May-1

Although much is now understood about the molecular structure of tight junctions (TJs), little is known about the regulation of their function during neural inflammatory disease processes in vivo. The mechanisms by which leukocytes transmigrate the blood-retina barrier (BRB) without affecting endothelial permeability are controversial.
METHODS: Confocal immunofluorescence microscopy of ex vivo retinal wholemounts was used to study BRB integrity during leukocyte adhesion and migration during experimental autoimmune uveoretinitis (EAU). Western blot analysis was used to measure levels of TJ proteins in EAU retina and RPE and in normal retina or RPE cultured with cytokines or chemokines.
RESULTS: No evidence for discontinuity or other weakness of the endothelial or epithelial barrier at tricellular corners was observed, and maximum disruption of TJ protein expression was focused in retinal venules correlating with sites of leukocyte extravasation. Areas of maximum TJ protein loss in vivo also correlated with redistribution or loss of ensheathing astrocyte processes on venules but not adjacent capillaries or arterioles. Exposure of normal choroidal and retinal explants ex vivo to cytokines and chemokines alone did not downregulate total occludin-1 or claudin-3 TJ protein expression.
CONCLUSIONS: The data presented herein support an active role for leukocytes in TJ disruption and blood-retina barrier (BRB) breakdown during retinal inflammation and further implicate venule microenvironment as a key factor in leukocyte recruitment to retinal tissue in vivo.",34,2005-Jul-1

To study the relative occurrence of uveitis (intraocular inflammation) and its causes in children and adolescents.
METHODS: Patients with uveitis examined and followed during a period of 10 years were categorised by age and sex. All underwent ocular examination and an individually tailored battery of laboratory tests. The intraocular manifestations were classified according to the anatomical location of the inflammation and their most probable cause. The final diagnosis was based on typical clinical ocular and extraocular symptoms and signs and on the results of specific laboratory investigations.
RESULTS: Out of 821 patients, 276 (33.1%) were 18 years of age or younger with a male to female ratio of 1 to 1. In these 276 children and adolescents, 70.3% had bilateral ocular involvement. Intermediate uveitis was the most frequent anatomical diagnosis. In many cases, symptoms were mild despite the prominent signs and marked decrease of vision. The underlying cause for the uveitis was evaluated as non-infectious in 184 cases (66.7%) and infectious in 92 cases (33.3%). A potential aetiology and/or a definite clinical diagnosis were established in 74.6% of the cases and only 25.4% of the 276 patients were classified as idiopathic. Juvenile idiopathic arthritis (JIA) was the most common systemic disease association diagnosed in 14.9% of these children. Parasite infestation was the most common infectious association.
CONCLUSIONS: Uveitis in children and adolescents is not as low as previously reported. Parasite infestation on the one hand and JIA on the other hand are the most common aetiologies associated with the uveitis in these young patients.",34,2005-Apr-1

To assess the efficacy of tocilizumab (TCZ) in refractory uveitis of Behçet's disease (BD).
METHODS: Multicentre study of patients with BD-associated uveitis. Patients were refractory to conventional and biologic immunosuppressive drugs. The main outcome measures were intraocular inflammation, macular thickness, visual acuity and corticosteroid-sparing effects.
RESULTS: We studied 11 patients (7 men) (20 affected eyes); median age 35 years. Uveitis was bilateral in nine patients. The patterns of ocular involvement were panuveitis (n = 8, with retinal vasculitis in 4), anterior uveitis (n = 2) and posterior uveitis (n = 1). Cystoid macular oedema was present in seven patients. The clinical course was recurrent (n = 7) or chronic (n = 4). Before TCZ, patients had received systemic corticosteroids, conventional immunosuppressants and the following biologic agents: adalimumab (n = 8), infliximab (n = 4), canakimumab (n = 1), golimumab (n = 3), etanercept (n = 1). TCZ was used as monotherapy or combined with conventional immunosuppressants at 8 mg/kg/i.v./4 weeks (n = 10) or 162 mg/s.c./week (n = 1). At TCZ onset the following extraocular manifestations were present: oral and/or genital ulcers (n = 7), arthritis (n = 4), folliculitis/pseudofolliculitis (n = 4), erythema nodosum (n = 2), livedo reticularis (n = 1) and neurological involvement (n = 2). TCZ yielded rapid and maintained improvement in all ocular parameters of the patients, with complete remission in eight of them. However, this was not the case for the extraocular manifestations, since TCZ was only effective in three of them. After a mean (s.d.) follow-up of 9.5 (8.05) months, TCZ was withdrawn in two cases, due to a severe infusion reaction and arthritis impairment, respectively.
CONCLUSION: TCZ could be a therapeutic option in patients with BD and refractory uveitis.",34,2018-May-01

To determine the validity and reliability of a novel questionnaire to measure vision-related quality of life (VRQOL) in children ages 8-18 years for use in juvenile idiopathic arthritis (JIA)-associated uveitis: the Effects of Youngsters' Eyesight on Quality of Life (EYE-Q).
METHODS: Several steps validated the EYE-Q. We interviewed experts and children on how vision affects a child's activities. We developed new items and selected relevant items from existing instruments. We administered initial versions of the EYE-Q to normal-sighted children and those with JIA-associated uveitis. For this study, children with various (or no) ocular conditions were recruited from a clinical population. Visual acuity and contrast sensitivity were performed, and the EYE-Q and Pediatric Quality of Life Inventory (PedsQL) were administered. The EYE-Q was repeated 10 days later. Patients, parents, and physicians rated vision severity.
RESULTS: Of 120 patients, 48% were female, 46.7% had no visual impairment, and 53.3% had bilateral eye involvement. The mean age was 11.3 years. There were significant differences in the measures based on visual acuity (P < 0.001). Children with more severe visual acuity and bilateral eye involvement had worse EYE-Q scores (P < 0.001). There were significant associations between the EYE-Q and PedsQL (r = 0.375), repeat EYE-Q (r = 0.864), and clinical measures of ocular disease (r = -0.620).
CONCLUSIONS: Our study provides evidence of the validity and reliability of the EYE-Q in the measurement of VRQOL. The EYE-Q may complement clinical measures of visual impairment and overall QOL and become an important tool in the assessment of QOL in JIA-associated uveitis.",34,2011-Sep-1

Tumour necrosis factor (TNF) blockers have been demonstrated to be effective in the treatment of systemic and ocular inflammatory diseases. We conducted a prospective, multicentre, open-label Phase II clinical trial to assess the effectiveness and safety of adalimumab, a fully human anti-TNF monoclonal antibody, in treating refractory uveitis.
METHODS: Subjects with non-infectious uveitis refractory to corticosteroids and at least one other immunosuppressive medication were enrolled. Treatment outcome was ascertained by a composite endpoint comprised of visual acuity, intraocular inflammation, ability to taper immunosuppressives, and posterior segment imaging. Clinical response was defined by improvement in at least one parameter, worsening in none, and well controlled intraocular inflammation. Week 10 responders were permitted to continue receiving adalimumab for the study duration of 50 weeks.
RESULTS: Twenty-one of 31 patients (68%) were characterised as clinical responders at 10 weeks, of whom 12 patients (39%) exhibited durable response after 50 weeks. The most common reason for study termination was primary or secondary inefficacy. No patients experienced treatment-limiting toxicity clearly related to study therapy.
CONCLUSIONS: Adalimumab was safe and effective in 68% of refractory uveitis patients 10 weeks after study enrolment, and maintained in 39% after 1 year. Ongoing study is required to determine the place of adalimumab and other TNF blockers in the treatment of uveitis.",34,2013-Apr-1

DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: This nationwide, retrospective cohort study conducted in Taiwan from January 1, 2000, to December 31, 2012 included 147 954 people with psoriasis (including 10 107 with concomitant psoriatic arthritis and 137 847 without psoriatic arthritis) and 147 954 nonpsoriatic controls.
EXPOSURE: Psoriasis.
MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: Risk of incident uveitis.
RESULTS: The mean (SD) age of the 295 908 study participants was 44.4 (19.8) years, and 41.2% (n = 121 878) were women. We found that the group with severe psoriasis with psoriatic arthritis had the greatest risk of incident uveitis compared with the nonpsoriatic controls (adjusted hazard ratio, 2.40; 95% CI, 1.90-3.02). The group with severe psoriasis without psoriatic arthritis and the group with mild psoriasis with psoriatic arthritis also had an increased risk of incident uveitis (adjusted hazard ratio, 1.42; 95% CI, 1.23-1.64; and 1.42; 95% CI, 1.03-1.96; respectively). However, an increased risk for incident uveitis with mild psoriasis without psoriatic arthritis was not identified (adjusted hazard ratio, 1.09; 95% CI, 1.00-1.20).
CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: People with severe psoriasis and those with mild psoriasis have an increased risk of uveitis. Clinicians may use this finding as a guide for uveitis risk stratification among patients with different inflammatory presentations on the spectrum of psoriatic disease.",34,2017-May-01

Uveitis is a common complication of spondyloarthritis. The ""phenotype"" of the uveitis characteristic of ankylosing spondylitis (sudden onset, anterior, unilateral, recurrent, more often male) may differ from the phenotype often seen with either psoriatic arthritis or inflammatory bowel disease (insidious onset, anterior and intermediate, bilateral, chronic, and/or more often female). The frequency of uveitis is also much greater in association with ankylosing spondylitis than with either inflammatory bowel disease or psoriasis. Uveitis may affect the choice of therapy and can rarely be a complication of therapy. Uveitis and arthritis also co-exist in several animal models.",33,2015-Jun-1

Diagnosis and management of intraocular inflammation involves the assessment of cells and protein levels (""flare"") in the aqueous humor. These factors are difficult to quantify precisely on clinical examination alone. Laser flare-cell photometry provides an automated technique to quantify these factors objectively, and it has been used in a variety of research and clinical situations to assess anterior segment inflammation. Any new technique requires evaluation to determine accuracy and reproducibility of measured values, and initial applications require critical appraisal to assess the value of the technique. Both in vitro and in vivo studies of laser flare-cell photometry have been performed to determine its validity and utility as a research and clinical tool. This article reviews published studies that describe the technique of laser flare-cell photometry; it provides new in vitro data that supplements information on the capabilities of this technique and factors that influence photometry results, and it reviews representative publications that have used laser flare-cell photometry for study of specific disease entities. This information can help clinicians and researchers to become familiar with the strengths and limitations of laser flare-cell photometry, to identify appropriate future uses for this technique, and to use it and interpret its results appropriately. Laser flare-cell photometry offers an opportunity to improve upon current techniques of inflammation assessment and should not be considered simply an objective surrogate for clinical grading of cells and flare at the slit-lamp biomicroscope. Its research applications and utility for monitoring patients with uveitis have not yet been fully explored.",33,2005-1-1

Uveitis is a challenging disease covering both infectious and noninfectious conditions. The current treatment strategies are hampered by the paucity of randomized controlled trials and trials comparing the efficacy of different agents.
AREAS COVERED: This review describes the current and future treatments of uveitis. A literature search was performed in PUBMED from 1965 to 2010 on drugs treating ocular inflammation with emphasis placed on more recent, larger studies. Readers should gain a basic understanding of current treatment strategies beginning with corticosteroids and transitioning to steroid sparing agents. Steroid sparing agents include antimetabolites such as methotrexate, azathioprine and mycophenolate mofetil; calcineurin inhibitors which include cyclosporine, tacrolimus; alkylating agents which include cyclophosphamide and chlorambucil; and biologics which include the TNF-α inhibitors infliximab, adalimumab and etanercept and daclizumab, IFN-α(2a) and rituximab.
EXPERT OPINION: Newer agents are typically formulated from existing drugs or developed based on new advances in immunology. Future treatment will require a better understanding of the mechanisms involved in autoimmune diseases and better delivery systems in order to provide targeted treatment with minimal side effects.",33,2011-Jun-1

A coherent view of the role of cytokines in inflammatory eye disease is emerging as a result of studies both in man and experimental animals. Cytokines have been demonstrated in ocular tissue obtained from patients with intraocular inflammation (uveitis) (gamma interferon, IL-2) and have been shown to induce inflammation in experimental animals after intraocular injection [(IL-1, IL-6, IL-8, tumour necrosis factor (TNF), granulocyte macrophage-colony stimulating factor (GM-CSF)]. Several unique features of the immunology of the eye such as the immunosuppression associated with anterior chamber associated immune deviation (ACAID) may be due to the effects of cytokines. Similarly, common complications of ocular inflammation such as glaucoma, keratic precipitates, retinal (macular) oedema and neovascularization may be mediated by cytokines. Understanding of the role of cytokines in inflammatory eye disease has the potential to lead to the development of therapies to abrogate the effects of these important mediators of the inflammatory response.",33,1992-Jan-1

MicroRNAs (miRNAs) have emerged as a class of gene expression regulators involved in immune regulation. In the present study, we investigated the role of miRNA in two uveitis entities: Behcet's disease (BD) and Vogt Koyanagi Harada syndrome (VKH).
METHODS: The expression of five miRNAs was studied in PBMCs, DCs, and CD4(+) T cells from BD patients with active and inactive uveitis, VKH patients with active uveitis, and healthy controls using real-time PCR. MiR-155 mimics and inhibitor were transfected to DCs to evaluate the effect on DC maturation and cytokine production by these cells and CD4(+) T cells. Luciferase reporter assays and Western blotting were performed to identify the target gene of miR-155.
RESULTS: Only miR-155 expression was significantly decreased in PBMCs and DCs from BD patients with active uveitis and no differences were observed in the miRNA expression in cells from patients with VKH as compared with controls. Overexpression of miR-155 in DCs was shown to inhibit the production of IL-6 and IL-1β, and to promote the expression of IL-10 by these cells. MiR-155 transfected DCs significantly inhibited intracellular IL-17 expression in allogeneic CD4(+) T cells; however, it did not influence the expression of cell surface markers CD80, CD40, CD83, CD86, and HLA-DR. Luciferase reporter assays revealed that TAB2 was a target gene of miR-155, which was confirmed by Western blotting.
CONCLUSIONS: The present results suggest that miR-155 expression is decreased in active BD but not in VKH patients. Downregulated miR-155 may be involved in BD pathogenesis by targeting TAB2.",33,2012-Aug-17

To assess the prevalence of active and inactive uveitis unrelated to previous surgery or trauma in an urban population in southern India.
METHODS: As part of the Andhra Pradesh Eye Disease Study, 2522 subjects (85.4% of those eligible), a sample representative of the population of Hyderabad city in southern India, underwent interview and detailed dilated eye examination. Presence of sequelae of uveitis without current active inflammation was defined as inactive uveitis.
RESULTS: Unequivocal evidence of active or inactive uveitis unrelated to previous surgery or trauma was present in 21 subjects, an age-sex adjusted prevalence of 0.73% (95% confidence interval (CI) 0.44-1.14%). Active uveitis was present in eight subjects, an age-sex adjusted prevalence of 0.37% (95% CI 0. 19-0.70), of which 0.06% was anterior, 0.25% intermediate, and 0.06% posterior. The 0.36% (95% CI 0.17-0.68%) prevalence of inactive uveitis included macular chorioretinitis scars (0.26%), anterior (0. 07%) and previous vasculitis involving the whole eye (0.03%). The prevalence of visual impairment due to uveitis of less than 6/18 in at least one eye was 0.27%, less than 6/60 in at least one eye was 0. 16%, and less than 6/60 in both eyes was 0.03%.
CONCLUSION: These population based cross sectional data give an estimate of the prevalence of various types of uveitis in this urban population in India. Active or past uveitis that might need treatment at some stage was present in one of every 140 people in this population.",33,2000-Jul-1

Uveitis associated with juvenile idiopathic arthritis (JIA) typically involves the anterior chamber segment, follows an indolent chronic course, and presents a high rate of uveitic complications and a worse outcome as compared to other aetiologies of uveitis. Disease assessment, treatment, and outcome measures have not been standardized. Collaboration between pediatric rheumatologists and ophthalmologists is critical for effective management and prevention of morbidity, impaired vision, and irreparable visual loss. Although the Standardization of Uveitis Nomenclature Working Group recommendations have been a great advance to help clinicians to improve consistency in grading and reporting data, difficulties arise at the time of deciding the best treatment approach in the individual patient in routine daily practice. For this reason, recommendations for a systematized control and treatment strategies according to clinical characteristics and disease severity in children with JIA-related uveitis were developed by a panel of experts with special interest in uveitis associated with JIA. A clinical management algorithm organized in a stepwise regimen is here presented.",33,2015-May-1

This study aimed to investigate the incidence and prevalence of uveitis in Taiwan, and then analyzed the risk factors related to uveitis using multivariate regression.
DESIGN: Population-based cohort study using medical claims data.
PARTICIPANTS: We randomly selected 1 000 000 residents from the Taiwan National Health Insurance Research Database. All participants with correct registry data (96%) were included in the study. The study period was from 2000 to 2008.
METHODS: All types of uveitis were identified using the International Classification of Diseases, 9th revision, Clinical Modification diagnostic codes. The annual incidence and cumulative prevalence of uveitis were calculated. A univariate and a multivariate Poisson regression were used to determine the risk factors associated with uveitis.
MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: The first diagnosis of uveitis noted during the study period.
RESULTS: The annual cumulative incidence rate of uveitis ranged from 102.2 to 122.0 cases per 100 000 persons over the study period, and the average incidence density was 111.3 cases per 100 000 person-years (95% confidence interval, 108.4-114.1). The cumulative prevalence was found to have increased from 318.8 cases per 100 000 persons in 2003 to 622.7 cases per 100 000 persons in 2008. Anterior uveitis was the most common location and accounted for 77.7% of all incident cases, which was followed by panuveitis, posterior uveitis, and intermediate uveitis. Multivariate regression analysis showed that males, the elderly, and individuals who lived in an urban area had higher incidence rates for uveitis.
CONCLUSIONS: The epidemiology of uveitis in Taiwan differs from most previous studies in other countries. The incidence of uveitis in Taiwan has increased significantly recently. The elderly and individuals living in urban areas are the populations that are most commonly affected by uveitis. These findings are consistent with suggestions found in several recent studies.",33,2012-Nov-1

Clinical manifestations of inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) are not locally restricted to the gastrointestinal tract, and a significant portion of patients have involvement of other organs and systems. The visual system is one of the most frequently affected, mainly by inflammatory disorders such as episcleritis, uveitis and scleritis. A critical review of available literature concerning ocular involvement in IBD, as it appears in PubMed, was performed. Episcleritis, the most common ocular extraintestinal manifestation (EIM), seems to be more associated with IBD activity when compared with other ocular EIMs. In IBD patients, anterior uveitis has an insidious onset, it is longstanding and bilateral, and not related to the intestinal disease activity. Systemic steroids or immunosuppressants may be necessary in severe ocular inflammation cases, and control of the underlying bowel disease is important to prevent recurrence. Our review revealed that ocular involvement is more prevalent in Crohn's disease than ulcerative colitis, in active IBD, mainly in the presence of other EIMs. The ophthalmic symptoms in IBD are mainly non-specific and their relevance may not be recognized by the clinician; most ophthalmic manifestations are treatable, and resolve without sequel upon prompt treatment. A collaborative clinical care team for management of IBD that includes ophthalmologists is central for improvement of quality care for these patients, and it is also cost-effective.",33,2017-Aug-28

Tubulointerstitial nephritis and uveitis (TINU) syndrome is considered a rare cause of acute tubulointerstitial nephritis (ATIN) that is usually associated with renal recovery. This study sought to investigate the diagnosis, prognosis, and contributing factors of TINU syndrome using a large cohort of patients with prospective follow-up.
DESIGN, SETTING, PARTICIPANTS, & MEASUREMENTS: This study included patients with TINU syndrome from a prospective cohort of patients with ATIN from 2007 to 2012. Clinical-pathologic data were collected at biopsy and autoantibodies against modified C-reactive protein (mCRP-Ab) were measured. Serum levels and renal tissue expression of Kreb von den Lunge-6 were also detected. Independent risk factors for poor renal outcome at 12 months and late-onset uveitis were analyzed.
RESULTS: Thirty-one patients (28%) with biopsy-proven ATIN were classified as having TINU syndrome. Of these patients, 18 (58%) developed late-onset uveitis and were misdiagnosed as having drug-induced ATIN at the time of biopsy. An abnormal level of mCRP-Ab was an independent risk factor for late-onset uveitis (odds ratio, 14.7; 95% confidence interval, 3.4 to 64.0). Patients with TINU syndrome and drug-induced ATIN had comparable levels of Kreb von den Lunge-6 in both serum and renal tissues. Ninety-two percent of patients developed stage 3-4 CKD and/or tubular dysfunction by 12 months postbiopsy. Age, serum creatine level, erythrocyte sedimentation rate, and the presence of concomitant thyroid disease or leukocyturia were related to poor renal outcome. Relapse was seen in 36% (11 of 31) of patients and potentiated poor renal outcome.
CONCLUSIONS: The diagnosis of TINU syndrome can be missed in a large fraction of patients with ATIN because uveitis can present well after the onset of tubulointerstitial nephritis. Elevated mCRP-Ab levels may be useful in predicting late-onset uveitis TINU syndrome. Unfortunately, patients with TINU tended to have frequent relapses and most patients had incomplete renal recovery. Long-term follow-up is needed to prevent misdiagnosis and properly manage TINU syndrome.",33,2014-Jan-1

A family is presented that had what is believed to be a previously undescribed syndrome of granulomatous synovitis, bilateral recurrent uveitis, and cranial neuropathies. Affected members included the proband, his brother, father, and probably the decreased paternal grandmother. Disease onset was in childhood. Each had symmetric, boggy polysynovitis of the hands and wrists, resulting in nearly identical boutonniere deformities. Hand radiography in the proband and his brother revealed no erosions or joint destruction despite more than 20 years of disease. Synovectomy specimens in the proband and his brother showed granulomatous inflammation with giant cells. Recurrent, nongranulomatous, acute iridocyclitis with visual impairment afflicted the proband, brother, and father. Apparently corticosteroid-responsive bilateral neurosensory hearing loss occurred in the proband, and a transient sixth cranial nerve palsy in his brother. All members of the family were antinuclear antibody-, rheumatoid factor-, and HLA-B27-negative. Serum angiotensin-converting enzyme levels were within normal limits in all family members. The inheritance pattern of this syndrome is most consistent with an autosomal dominant mode.",33,1985-May-1

Inhibiting TNF-alpha activity prevents tissue destruction without inhibiting retinal T cell infiltration in experimental autoimmune uveoretinitis (EAU) in Lewis rats. To further determine the role of TNF-alpha in autoimmune uveitis we characterized T cells isolated from retinae after treatment with a TNF-alpha antagonist. TNF-alpha activity was neutralized in vivo with a p55 TNF-alpha receptor-Ig fusion protein (sTNFr-Ig), administered 8 and 10 days after induction of EAU with heterologous retinal antigens. Retinal T-cell phenotype expression was examined by flow cytometry with respect to OX22 status (CD45RBlow or CD45RBhigh), activation (OX40 and CD25 expression) and rate of T-cell apoptosis (Annexin V+PI- expression). Lymphocyte reactivity was assessed by proliferation responses and cytokine production to retinal antigens. Despite greater than 40% of CD4+ T cells being activated at the height of disease, the proportion of OX22low expression was reduced and T cells exhibited reduced IFN-gamma and elevated IL-4 production. Retinal T cells maintained antigen-specific proliferation and demonstrated a low apoptotic rate. Although in both animal groups, comparable numbers of T cells were isolated, neutralizing TNF activity suppressed Th1 effector mechanisms protecting against target organ damage.",33,1998-Jun-1

To present long-term outcomes of Ahmed glaucoma valve implantation for uveitic glaucoma.
DESIGN: Interventional case series.
METHODS: Retrospective chart review of 60 patients (60 eyes) with uveitic glaucoma who underwent Ahmed valve implantation over a four-year period at a tertiary uveitis referral center. Success definition 1 included patients with an intraocular pressure (IOP) between 5 and 21 mm Hg, reduced by 25% from that before implantation. Success definition 2 (qualified success) excluded those patients in whom serious complications occurred.
RESULTS: Mean follow-up time was 30 months (range, six to 87 months; four-year results relate to a cohort of 15 patients). Success rates were 77% and 50% and qualified success rates were 57% and 39% at one and four years, respectively. At four years, 74% of the patients required glaucoma medication to maintain IOP control. The overall complication rate was 12%/person-years. The rate of visual acuity loss was 4%/person-years; that was most commonly attributed to corneal complications that were more likely to occur in patients with preoperative corneal disease (P = .01, Fisher exact test).
CONCLUSIONS: Ahmed glaucoma valve implantation is a safe yet moderately successful procedure for uveitic glaucoma. Long-term success rates are enhanced with the use of glaucoma medications, and corneal complications are the most common of all potential serious complications.",33,2007-Jul-1

The study aim was to evaluate the efficacy of adalimumab (ADA) in a large series of Behçet's disease (BD)-related uveitis. We performed a multicenter retrospective observational study including 40 selected patients (66 eyes) receiving ADA. Clinical data were retrospectively analyzed at baseline, at 3 and 12 months of treatment. Primary end point was reduction of ocular inflammatory flares. Secondary end points were improvement of best corrected visual acuity (BCVA), reduction of macular thickness measured by optical coherence tomography (OCT), reduction in the occurrence of vasculitis assessed by fluorescein angiography (FA), and evaluation of statistically significant differences between patients treated with ADA monotherapy and those undergoing ADA plus DMARDs and in patients firstly treated with ADA compared to patients previously administered with other biologics; ADA steroid sparing effect was also evaluated. During the first 12 months of ADA therapy, the number of flares significantly decreased from 200 flares/100 patients/year to 8.5 flares/100 patients/year (p < 0.0001). Similarly, BCVA improved if compared to baseline (7.4 ± 2.9 versus 8.5 ± 2.1, p = 0.03). OCT findings significantly improved showing a mean reduction of central macular thickness (CMT) of 27.27 ± 42.8 μm at the end of follow-up (p < 0.006). FA identified retinal vasculitis in 22 cases at baseline (55%), 8 (20%) cases after 3 months, and in only one (2.5%) case at 12-month follow-up. FA improvement was highly significant at 3- and 12-month follow-up if compared to baseline (p < 0.0001 and p = 0.006, respectively). ADA is highly effective and safe for the treatment of BD-related uveitis, providing a long-term control of ocular inflammation.",33,2017-Jan-1

To evaluate the long-term efficacy and safety of infliximab for the treatment of uveitis in Behçet's disease (BD).
DESIGN: Retrospective multicenter study using a questionnaire.
PARTICIPANTS: A total of 164 consecutive patients with BD treated with infliximab for more than 1 year were studied. The mean age at initiation of infliximab treatment was 42.6±11.7 years, and the mean treatment duration was 32.9±14.4 months.
METHODS: Data before and at the last visit during infliximab treatment were analyzed in 4 groups divided by duration of treatment: group A (n = 43, 12-<24 months), group B (n = 62, 24-<36 months), group C (n = 42, 36-<48 months), and group D (n = 17, ≥48 months).
MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Best-corrected visual acuity (BCVA), relapse of ocular inflammation, numbers of ocular inflammatory attacks per year, and adverse effects of infliximab therapy.
RESULTS: The frequency of ocular attacks decreased in all groups (from 5.3±3.0 to 1.0±0.3 in group A, 4.8±4.6 to 1.4±0.3 in group B, 4.1±2.9 to 0.9±0.3 in group C, and 9.5±5.8 to 1.6±0.5 in group D; all P < 0.05). The BCVA was improved in approximately 55% of the eyes after treatment. Mean BCVA converted to logarithm of the minimum angle of resolution was improved after treatment with infliximab in groups A to C (from 0.79±1.04 to 0.59±0.94 in group A, 0.59±1.07 to 0.41±1.04 in group B, and 1.15±1.77 to 0.92±1.73 in group C; all P < 0.05) but not in group D. Uveitis relapsed in 59.1% of all patients after infliximab treatment, and no difference in duration until relapse was observed between individual groups. Approximately 80% of relapses occurred within 1 year after the initiation of infliximab treatment in all groups, 90% of which were controlled by increasing doses of topical corticosteroids and shortening the interval of infliximab infusion. Adverse effects were observed in 65 cases or 35% of all subjects. Infliximab treatment was continued in 85% of the patients, but 15% of the patients discontinued infliximab treatment because of adverse effects or insufficient efficacy.
CONCLUSIONS: Infliximab reduced the frequency of ocular attacks and improved visual acuity in patients with BD-related uveitis and was generally well tolerated with few serious adverse events.",33,2014-Oct-1

To assess the response and adverse events associated with infliximab treatment for refractory, noninfectious pediatric uveitis.
DESIGN: Retrospective noncomparative case series of pediatric patients with refractory uveitis treated with infliximab.
PARTICIPANTS: Six patients were identified. Diagnoses of the participants included idiopathic uveitis (n = 1), juvenile rheumatoid arthritis with uveitis (n = 3), idiopathic retinal vasculitis with uveitis (n = 1), and bilateral pars planitis, with vitreitis and papillitis of the left eye (n = 1). Uveitis developed in the patients (5 female, 1 male) at a mean age of 9.0 years (+/-5.0 years; range, 0.9-14.8 years). All patients had bilateral eye involvement. These patients were refractory to or dependent on topical steroids (n = 4), oral prednisone (n = 3), or both, and were also refractory to the following therapies: methotrexate (n = 6), cyclosporine (n = 3), mycophenolate mofetil (n = 3), etanercept (n = 3), and daclizumab (n = 1).
INTERVENTION: All patients initially received infliximab at doses between 5 and 10 mg/kg at 2- to 4-week intervals, and then were maintained at 4- to 8-week intervals at doses of 5 to 18 mg/kg. Mean follow-up time on treatment has been 48.1 weeks (+/-14.9 weeks; range, 32-74 weeks).
MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Primary outcome measures included the quantitative measurement of the amount of ocular inflammation in different locations within the eye. Patients were monitored for infusion reactions as well as other potential side effects. The children's clinical status, complete blood counts, and liver function panels were monitored by pediatric rheumatologists every 6 weeks.
RESULTS: All 6 patients showed reduction in their intraocular inflammation after infliximab therapy was initiated. Furthermore, control of ocular inflammation was achieved while receiving infliximab therapy. Topical and systemic corticosteroids were able to be discontinued in all patients except for 1 patient, who is currently weaning off prednisone. The only adverse reactions seen were the development of vitreous hemorrhage in 1 patient and a case of transient upper respiratory infusion reaction. No patient has had to discontinue treatment.
CONCLUSIONS: Infliximab seems to be an effective agent for the treatment of refractory pediatric uveitis without apparent serious toxicity in this series of patients.",33,2006-Feb-1

To assess the effectiveness of methotrexate (MTX) in the treatment of juvenile idiopathic arthritis (JIA) associated uveitis, which is still one of the most common causes of visual impairment.
METHODS: A retrospective chart review of patients with the diagnosis of uveitis associated with JIA between July 1, 2002, and December 31, 2002.
RESULTS: Four hundred sixty-seven patients with JIA were followed. Thirty-eight had uveitis: 31 associated with oligoarticular JIA and 7 with psoriatic JIA. Twenty-five of the 38 patients received MTX; in 23 patients uveitis was the indication for MTX therapy. In the MTX treated group 46/50 eyes had uveitis, the mean (range) age at onset of uveitis was 7.82 years (1.8-15.8), and the mean age at onset of arthritis was 7.25 years (1.25-15.7). MTX treatment was started an average of 11.4 months (0-72) after the onset of uveitis. The mean MTX dose was 15.6 mg/m2. Remission occurred after 4.25 months (1-12). Mean duration of remission was 10.3 months (3-27). The total duration of MTX therapy was 661 months and patients were in remission for 417/661 months. In 6 patients MTX was discontinued after 12 months of remission. Four patients were still in remission after 7.5 months (1-14).
CONCLUSION: MTX seems to be an effective therapy for JIA associated uveitis.",33,2005-Feb-1

Despite advances in clinical imaging and grading our understanding of retinal immune responses and their morphological correlates in experimental autoimmune uveoretinitis (EAU), has been hindered by the requirement for post-mortem histology. To date, monitoring changes occurring during EAU disease progression and evaluating the effect of therapeutic intervention in real time has not been possible. We wanted to establish whether optical coherence tomography (OCT) could detect intraretinal changes during inflammation and to determine its utility as a tool for accurate scoring of EAU. EAU was induced in C57BL/6J mice and animals evaluated after 15, 26, 36 and 60 days. At each time-point, contemporaneous Spectralis-OCT scanning, topical endoscopic fundal imaging (TEFI), fundus fluorescein angiography (FFA) and CD45-immunolabelled histology were performed. OCT features were further characterised on retinal flat-mounts using immunohistochemistry and 3D reconstruction. Optic disc swelling and vitreous opacities detected by OCT corresponded to CD45+ cell infiltration on histology. Vasculitis identified by FFA and OCT matched perivascular myeloid and T-cell infiltrates and could be differentiated from unaffected vessels. Evolution of these changes could be followed over time in the same eye. Retinal folds were visible and found to encapsulate mixed populations of activated myeloid cells, T-cells and microglia. Using these features, an OCT-based EAU scoring system was developed, with significant correlation to validated histological (Pearson r(2) = 0.6392, P<0.0001, n = 31 eyes) and TEFI based scoring systems (r(2) = 0.6784, P<0.0001). OCT distinguishes the fundamental features of murine EAU in vivo, permits dynamic assessment of intraretinal changes and can be used to score disease severity. As a result, it allows tissue synchronisation with subsequent cellular and functional assessment and greater efficiency of animal usage. By relating OCT signals with immunohistochemistry in EAU, our findings offer the opportunity to inform the interpretation of OCT changes in human uveitis.",32,2013-1-1

To examine the 36-month efficacy and safety of a 0.2 μg/day fluocinolone acetonide insert (FAi) to treat noninfectious uveitis of the posterior segment (NIU-PS).
DESIGN: Phase 3, prospective, double-masked, multicenter study (clinicaltrials.gov, NCT01694186).
PARTICIPANTS: Adults (≥18 years old) with a diagnosis of NIU-PS in ≥1 eye for ≥1 year and ≥2 recurrences of uveitis requiring systemic corticosteroid, immunosuppressive treatment, or intraocular corticosteroids.
METHODS: Participants were randomized 2:1 to FAi or sham (injection plus standard of care) treatment.
MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: The primary outcome was the difference between the proportion of FAi-treated and sham-treated patients who had a uveitis recurrence. Secondary outcomes included time to first recurrence, number of recurrences, best-corrected visual acuity (BCVA) change from baseline, resolution of macular edema, and number of adjunctive treatments.
RESULTS: One hundred twenty-nine participants (n = 87 FAi-treated; n = 42 sham-treated) were enrolled. Over 36 months of treatment, cumulative uveitis recurrences were significantly reduced with FAi compared with sham (65.5% vs. 97.6%, respectively; P < 0.001); time to first recurrence was commensurately longer (median 657.0 and 70.5 days, respectively; P < 0.001). The number of recurrences per eye was significantly lower in the FAi-treated compared with the sham-treated group (mean 1.7 vs. 5.3, respectively, P < 0.001). At 36 months, more FAi-treated eyes had a ≥15-letter increase in BCVA from baseline and fewer FAi-treated eyes had investigator-determined macular edema at month 36 compared with sham-treated eyes (33.3% vs. 14.7% and 13.0% vs. 27.3% for BCVA and macular edema, respectively). Fewer FAi compared with sham-treated participants required adjunctive treatments (57.5% vs. 97.6%, respectively). Intraocular pressure (IOP) was similar for both study groups at month 36 (mean ± standard deviation 14.5±5.1 and 14.8±5.3, respectively), and approximately half as many eyes in the FAi-treated group when compared with the sham-treated group underwent IOP-lowering surgery (5.7% vs. 11.9%). Cataract surgery was required more frequently over 36 months in the FAi-treated compared with the sham-treated group (73.8% vs. 23.8% of eyes, respectively).
CONCLUSIONS: Fluocinolone acetonide insert-treated eyes had significantly reduced uveitis recurrence rates throughout the study duration, significantly increased recurrence-free durations, fewer recurrence episodes among those with recurrences, less adjunctive therapy, and an acceptable side-effect profile compared with sham-treated eyes.",32,2020-Oct-1

This study investigated whether the administration of resolvin D1 to rats with endotoxininduced uveitis (EIU) ameliorates the immuno-inflammatory profile of the eye. 24 h after the administration of 200 μg LPS into the footpad of Sprague-Dawley rats, severe changes of the structure of the eye occurred concomitantly with a severe inflammatory and immune response. These latter included strong infiltration of PMN leukocytes CD11b(+) T-lymphocytes CD4(+) and CD8(+) within the eye and a significant release of the cytokines/chemokines TNF-alpha, CXCL8, and RANTES too. Bolus of resolvin D1 (RvD1; 10-100-1000 ng/kg in 200 μL of sterile saline via the tail vein) significantly and dose-dependently (i) reduced the development of the ocular derangement caused by LPS; (ii) reduced the clinical score attributed to EIU; (iii) reduced the protein concentration and myeloperoxidase activity (MPO) in aqueous humor (AqH); and (iv) reduced neutrophils, T-lymphocytes, and cytokines within the eye.",32,2012-1-1

Experimental autoimmune uveoretinitis (EAU) in mice is a model for human autoimmune uveitis. Longitudinal follow-up is only possible by non-invasive techniques, but the information obtained by visual fundus examination can be limited. We therefore evaluated the efficacy of optical coherence tomography (OCT) and electroretinography (ERG) to monitor pathological and functional changes of the retina in vivo. OCT imaging and ERG recording as a measure of visual function were compared with visual fundoscopic imaging and histology findings in the same mouse. Our results showed that OCT imaging of the retina was well correlated with clinical and histological observations in mice during EAU. However, OCT imaging was more sensitive than fundoscopic imaging in detecting the cell infiltrates at the early phase of disease onset. Furthermore, by allowing multi-layer cross- and horizontal-sectional visualizations of retinal lesions longitudinally in a noninvasive fashion, OCT added information that could not be obtained by fundoscopic and histological examinations. Lastly, retinal thickness obtained by OCT imaging provided a key indicator reflecting disease activity, which showed a close association with visual dysfunction as measured by ERG recordings in EAU mice. Thus, our findings demonstrate that OCT is a highly sensitive and reliable technique, and a valuable method for the semi-quantitative evaluation of retinal inflammation in vivo in the mouse.",32,2013-1-1

Autoimmune uveitis, a group of potentially blinding intraocular inflammatory diseases, remains a therapeutic challenge for ophthalmologists. Butyrates, which belong to the short-chain fatty acid family, possess immunomodulatory properties and therapeutic potential in several inflammatory disorders. However, the roles of butyrates in uveitis and their underlying immunomodulatory mechanisms remain elusive. Here, we report that treatment with sodium butyrate (NaB) significantly attenuated the ocular inflammatory response in mice with experimental autoimmune uveitis (EAU) at 14days after immunization, with significant decreases in inflammatory cell infiltration and inflammatory cytokine production in the retinas. Furthermore, NaB treatment decreased the frequency and number of Th17 cells and increased the frequency and number of T regulatory (Treg) cells in both draining lymph nodes and spleens of EAU mice. In vitro, NaB treatment directly converted the differentiation of naive T cells from Th17 cells toward Treg cells. Mechanistically, the NaB-mediated inhibition of Th17 cell differentiation may occur via inhibition of the nuclear factor erythroid 2-related factor 2 (Nrf2)/heme oxygenase 1 (HO-1)/interleukin-6 receptor pathway. Moreover, the NaB-mediated inhibition on Th17 cell differentiation and uveitis were abrogated when an HO-1 inhibitor, SnPP, was used. These findings suggest that NaB inverts the differentiation of Th17 cells toward Treg cells and attenuates experimental autoimmune uveitis by modulating the Nrf2/HO-1 pathway.",32,2017-Oct-15

Uveitis is a prevalent disease that mainly affects young people. It leads to a significant number of visual losses. Acute anterior uveitis is the most prevalent form, and it is often associated with spondyloarthritides in which uveitis can be the first manifestation of disease. Precise patterns of uveitis are frequently associated with systemic diseases. Thus, the close collaboration between ophthalmologists and rheumatologists avoids unnecessary diagnostic tests and is essential for the correct assessment and treatment of these patients. Acute anterior uveitis usually has a good prognosis compared with other forms of uveitis. However, it is a cause of disability when flares are frequent. Small prospective studies conducted with sulphasalazine have demonstrated a reduction in the number of flares. Other patterns of uveitis have a worse prognosis, and systemic corticosteroids and/or immunosuppressive drugs are usually required. Infliximab is a promising therapeutic option in selected patients.",32,2006-Jun-1

To investigate long-term responsiveness of patients with severe uveitis associated with Behçet disease to interferon alpha2a (IFN-alpha2a).
DESIGN: Retrospective study.
METHODS: Thirty-two patients with sight-threatening uveitis associated with Behçet disease who relapsed despite corticosteroids and immunosuppressive agents were included. IFN-alpha2a was administered subcutaneously (three million units thrice a week). Ophthalmologic examination and fluorescein angiography associated with laboratory tests were performed at regular intervals. Main outcome measures were visual acuity and recurrence of uveitis attacks before, during, and after initiation of IFN-alpha2a therapy.
RESULTS: Control of inflammation was achieved in 28 of 32 patients (88%). Mean observation period of the 28 responder patients was 70.6 months (range, 30.3 to 129.2 months). Median visual acuity improved from 0.52 to 0.33 (logarithm of the minimum angle of resolution units; P = .005) two years after initiation of IFN-alpha2a therapy. The relapse rate decreased significantly during IFN-alpha2a treatment from 1.68 +/- 1.22 relapses/patient/year to 0.11 +/- 0.20 relapses/patient/year (P < .0001). IFN-alpha2a was discontinued in 19 of 28 patients (68%) after 32 months of treatment (range, 16 to 50 months). Mean follow-up after IFN-alpha2a discontinuation was 43 months (range, 11 to 84 months). After IFN-alpha2a discontinuation, the relapse rate increased from 0.08 +/- 0.21 relapse/person/year to 0.74 +/- 1.40 relapse/person/year (P = 0.04).
CONCLUSIONS: IFN-alpha2a is efficient and safe for the long-term management of severe uveitis associated with Behçet disease. Meanwhile it seems to be a suspensive therapeutic strategy, even though long-term remission is possible in some patients.",32,2008-Dec-1

To summarize evidence regarding the effectiveness of MTX in the treatment of childhood autoimmune chronic uveitis (ACU).
METHODS: A systematic search of articles between January 1990 and June 2011 was conducted using EMBASE, Ovid MEDLINE, Evidence-Based Medicine Reviews-ACP Journal Club, the Cochrane Library and EBM Reviews. Studies investigating the efficacy of MTX as a single immunosuppressant medication in the treatment of ACU refractory to therapy with topical treatment and/or systemic treatment in children (≤16 years) were eligible for inclusion. The primary outcome measure was the improvement of intraocular inflammation, expressed as Tyndall, as defined by the Standardization of Uveitis Nomenclature working group criteria. The effect measure for each study was the proportion of people classified as responders. We determined a combined estimate of the proportion of children in the eligible studies responding to MTX.
RESULTS: The initial search identified 246 articles of which 52 were potentially eligible. Nine eligible articles, all retrospective chart reviews, remained in the analysis. The number of children in studies ranged from 3 to 25, and the dose of MTX varied from 7.5 to 30 mg/m2. Altogether, 95 of 135 children responded to MTX. The pooled analysis suggested that MTX has a favourable effect in the improvement of intraocular inflammation: the proportion of responding subjects was 0.73 (95% CI 0.66, 0.81).
CONCLUSION: Although randomized controlled trials are needed, the available evidence supports the use of MTX in the treatment of childhood ACU: approximately three-quarters of patients on MTX can expect improvement in intraocular inflammation.",32,2013-May-1

To describe the ocular findings, visual impairment, and association of structural complications of uveitis with visual impairment in a cohort of survivors of Ebola virus disease (EVD) in Monrovia, Liberia.
DESIGN: Retrospective, uncontrolled, cross-sectional study.
PARTICIPANTS: Survivors of EVD who were evaluated in an ophthalmology clinic at Eternal Love Winning Africa (ELWA) Hospital in Monrovia, Liberia.
METHODS: A cohort of EVD survivors who underwent baseline ophthalmic evaluation at ELWA Hospital were retrospectively reviewed for demographic information, length of Ebola treatment unit (ETU) stay, visual acuity (VA), and ophthalmic examination findings. For patients with uveitis, disease activity (active vs. inactive) and grade of inflammation were recorded according to Standardization of Uveitis Nomenclature criteria. The level of VA impairment was categorized according to World Health Organization classification for VA impairment as follows: normal/mild, VA 20/70 or better; moderate, VA 20/70-20/200; severe, VA 20/200-20/400; blindness, VA <20/400. Visual acuity, length of ETU stay, and structural complications were compared between EVD survivors with and without uveitis. Structural complications associated with moderate VA impairment or poorer were analyzed.
MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Frequency of ocular complications including uveitis and optic neuropathy in EVD survivors, level of VA impairment in EVD survivors with uveitis, and structural complications associated with VA impairment in EVD survivors.
RESULTS: A total of 96 survivors of EVD were examined. A total of 21 patients developed an EVD-associated uveitis, and 3 patients developed an EVD-associated optic neuropathy. Visual acuity was blind (VA >20/400) in 38.5% of eyes with uveitis. Anatomic subtypes of uveitis included anterior, posterior, and panuveitis in 2, 13, and 6 patients, respectively. Examination findings associated with at least moderate visual impairment by World Health Organization criteria (VA <20/70) included keratic precipitates (P < 0.002), posterior synechiae (P < 0.002), vitritis (P < 0.005), and chorioretinal scars (P < 0.02).
CONCLUSIONS: Survivors of EVD are at risk for uveitis, which may lead to secondary structural complications, visual impairment, and blindness. Eye care resources should be mobilized for EVD survivors in West Africa because of the frequency of this spectrum of disease complication and its potential for severe VA impairment and blindness.",32,2017-Feb-1

To determine which clinical features distinguish ocular sarcoidosis from other forms of uveitis in an international population and to estimate the sensitivity and specificity of the International Workshop on Ocular Sarcoidosis (IWOS) clinical signs and laboratory tests.
DESIGN: Multicenter, retrospective medical record review.
PARTICIPANTS: Eight hundred eighty-four patients with uveitis from 19 centers in 12 countries.
METHODS: Data collected included suspected cause of uveitis, clinical findings, and laboratory investigations within 6 months of presentation. The IWOS criteria were used to classify patients as having definite (biopsy-proven), presumed (evidence of bilateral hilar lymphadenopathy [BHL] on chest radiograph or CT scan), probable, or possible ocular sarcoidosis. Patients with biopsy positive results or BHL on chest radiograph or CT scan were considered sarcoidosis cases.
MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Sensitivity and specificity of clinical signs and laboratory investigations for diagnosing ocular sarcoidosis.
RESULTS: Of the 884 uveitis patients, 264 (30%) were suspected to have ocular sarcoidosis. One hundred eighty patients (20%) met the IWOS criteria; 98 were definite (biopsy-proven) disease, 69 presumed disease (BHL), 10 probable disease, and 3 possible disease. Among sarcoidosis cases, the most common clinical signs were bilaterality (86%); snowballs or string of pearls (50%); mutton-fat keratic precipitates, iris nodules, or both (46%); and multiple chorioretinal peripheral lesions (45%). Sixty-two percent of sarcoidosis cases had elevated angiotensin converting enzyme or lysozyme and 5% demonstrated abnormal liver enzyme test results. Of the patients suspected of having sarcoidosis, 97 (37%) did not meet the IWOS criteria.
CONCLUSIONS: With the exception of BHL, IWOS clinical findings and investigational tests had low sensitivities for diagnosing ocular sarcoidosis. In particular, liver function tests seem to have little usefulness in diagnosing ocular sarcoidosis. Many patients suspected of having sarcoidosis did not fit into the classification system, indicating that the guidelines may need to be reconsidered. Adding novel laboratory tests and using more advanced statistical methods may lead to the development of a more generalizable classification system.",32,2018-Jan-1

Evaluate a single suprachoroidal injection of a proprietary triamcinolone acetonide suspension, CLS-TA, in subjects with macular edema due to noninfectious uveitis.
METHODS: Randomized, controlled, masked Phase 2 study. Safety and efficacy of a single suprachoroidal injection of CLS-TA (4.0 and 0.8 mg in a 4:1 ratio) were assessed at 1 and 2 months after injection. The primary efficacy endpoint was change in central subfield thickness from baseline to Month 2, assessed by spectral domain optical coherence tomography.
RESULTS: Twenty-two adults were enrolled. The primary endpoint was met in subjects who received suprachoroidal injection of CLS-TA 4.0 mg, mean central subfield thickness significantly decreased from baseline by 135 µm and 164 µm at Month 1 (P = 0.0056) and Month 2 (P = 0.0017), respectively. At Month 2, 69% of subjects who received 4.0 mg experienced ≥20% reduction in central subfield thickness, and 65% had improvement of best-corrected visual acuity of ≥5 Early Treatment Diabetic Retinopathy Study letters, with a mean improvement of 9.2 letters (P = 0.0004). Safety analyses supported acceptable safety/tolerability, with no corticosteroid-related increases in intraocular pressure.
CONCLUSION: A single suprachoroidal injection of CLS-TA (4.0 mg; 0.1 mL) in subjects with macular edema due to noninfectious uveitis was well-tolerated, significantly reduced central subfield thickness from baseline at 2 months, and significantly improved visual acuity.",32,2019-Oct-1

Bartonella henselae has only recently been isolated, characterized, and found to be the principal cause of cat-scratch disease (CSD). The availability of specific serologic investigations has allowed the recognition of a spectrum of ocular CSD syndromes that previously were ill defined and considered idiopathic. The primary inoculation complex causing regional lymphadenopathy is represented in the eye by Parinaud's oculoglandular syndrome; B. henselae is the most common cause. Leber's neuroretinitis has been identified for 80 years, and new data suggest that it is commonly a manifestation of CSD; the extent of the association remains to be determined. CSD optic neuritis is also described. The vitreoretinal manifestations include anterior uveitis, vitritis, pars planitis, focal retinal vasculitis, a characteristic retinal white spot syndrome, Bartonella retinitis, branch retinal arteriolar or venular occlusions, focal choroiditis, serous retinal detachments, and peripapillary angiomatous lesions. The pattern of ocular disease in AIDS-associated B. henselae infections is poorly delineated; unusual manifestations include conjunctival and retinal bacillary angiomatosis. The benefit of antimicrobial therapy for CSD in immunocompetent individuals has been difficult to establish, partly because most infections are self limited. Empirically, azithromycin, ciprofloxacin, rifampin, parenteral gentamicin, or trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole provide the best therapeutic choices to minimize damage to the eye.",32,1999-Jun-1

Recent studies demonstrated that administration of a p55-tumor necrosis factor (TNF) receptor IgG-fusion protein (TNFR-IgG) prevented the clinical onset of experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis but did not alter the number or tissue distribution of autoantigen-specific CD4+ effector T cells which trafficked into the central nervous system. To determine whether specific target tissues of autoimmune damage remain intact after TNFR-IgG treatment despite the presence of inflammatory cells within the tissues, we examined rats with experimental autoimmune uveoretinitis (EAU), as in this model, the main target of autoreactive CD4+ T cells, the retinal rod outer segments (ROS), can be examined readily by light microscopy. As judged by direct ophthalmoscopy, the onset of inflammation in the anterior chamber of the eye in EAU following administration of TNFR-IgG was delayed by 6 days compared to untreated controls, but the magnitude of the response was only slightly less than controls. Histological examination of the retinae and direct assessment of retinal inflammation revealed a disproportionate sparing of ROS in the TNFR-IgG-treated animals despite a level of retinal inflammation not substantially less than controls in which ROS damage was marked. Analysis of retinal leukocytes by immunofluorescence microscopy and flow cytometry indicated that approximately equal numbers of CD4+ alpha beta TCR+ lymphocytes were present in treated and control retinae, more than 30% of CD4+ cells in both experimental groups expressed the CD25 or MRC OX40 activation markers and most cells, which would include the CD4+ T lymphocytes, were activated as evidenced by MHC class II expression. Fewer activated macrophages and granulocytes were present in the treated retinae, possibly reflecting the lower level of tissue damage and subsequent accumulation of these inflammatory cells. The results demonstrate directly that a tissue specifically targeted for autoimmune destruction can be protected despite the influx of fully activated CD4+ T cells.",31,1996-May-1

This review aims to provide an update on the clinical presentation, diagnosis, and treatment of ocular syphilis. While ocular syphilis is not a new phenomenon, recent resurgence in the incidence of overall syphilis, particularly among HIV-positive individuals, has sparked a new interest in an old disease. The challenge of ocular syphilis is manifold: firstly, it manifests in a spectrum of ways that can occur at any stage of the disease, with the most common finding being panuveitis. It may occur as early as 6 weeks after transmission and may be the only presenting feature of systemic syphilis; secondly, the relationship between HIV and syphilis has been established, as primary syphilis facilitates HIV transmission and HIV may modify the natural course of syphilis, increasing the propensity of the disease to progress to neurosyphilis. The authors present the latest updates to the changing landscape of ocular syphilis.",31,2019-1-1

The main objective of this study was to determine the causes of uveitis at a referral center in Riyadh, Saudi Arabia.
METHODS: We carried out a retrospective review of clinical records of 200 uveitis cases referred to The Eye Center, a referral center in Riyadh, Saudi Arabia. There were 120 (60%) males and 80 (40%) females with an age range of 7 to 91 years and a mean age of 35 (SD +/- 17). Patients had complete ophthalmic and medical examinations. Laboratory studies were requested whenever indicated. Patients were followed up for a minimum of 12 months.
RESULTS: In the period 1995-2000, we encountered 200 cases of uveitis among a total of 20,191 consecutive new cases, yielding a prevalence of 1%. Acute anterior uveitis of undetermined origin was found in 58 (29%) of 200 patients. There were 13 (6.5%) cases of Behçet's disease, 7 (3.5%) of Fuchs' heterochromic iridocyclitis, 6 (3%) of sarcoidosis, and 5 (2.5%) patients had Vogt-Koyanagi-Harada syndrome (VKH). Among the infectious causes, herpetic uveitis was found in 32 (16%) patients, tuberculosis in 21 (10.5%), and toxoplasmosis in 13 (6.5%) cases. Seventeen (8.5%) cases were of miscellaneous origin and in 28 (14%) cases the etiologic diagnosis was undetermined.
CONCLUSION: Acute anterior uveitis of undetermined origin was the most common cause of uveitis, followed by Behçet's disease. Herpetic uveitis was the most common infectious cause of uveitis. Ocular tuberculosis and toxoplasmosis were found to be common causes of infectious uveitis at this referral center in Saudi Arabia.",31,2002-Oct-1

Vogt-Koyanagi-Harada syndrome is a bilateral, chronic, diffuse granulomatous panuveitis frequently associated with neurological, auditory, and integumentary manifestations. It is also one of the most common forms of uveitis among pigmented races including Chinese patients.
METHODS: This article reviews the current developments of Vogt-Koyanagi-Harada syndrome, including epidemiology, etiology, clinical features, observational techniques, genetics, treatment, and prognosis.
RESULTS: Increasing reports have been published to describe the clinical features of Vogt-Koyanagi-Harada syndrome in various ethnic populations from different parts of the world. In spite of tremendous progress in laboratory and clinical research, the etiology of Vogt-Koyanagi-Harada syndrome is still not completely known. Numerous studies indicate an autoimmune nature for this disease. A recent study has shown that Th17, a new subset of T cell, plays an important role in the initiation and maintenance of this disease. Early and aggressive systemic corticosteroids are still the mainstay of initial therapy for Vogt-Koyanagi-Harada syndrome. However, nonsteroid immunomodulatory therapy, including cyclosporine, chlorambucil, cyclophosphamide, and azathioprine have brought out encouraging results. Improved visual outcomes in patients with Vogt-Koyanagi-Harada syndrome in recent years have been reported when compared with decades ago, presumably due to the more aggressive use of immunosuppressive agents.
CONCLUSION: Although the prognosis for VKH syndrome was greatly improved, future prospective, controlled, multi-center studies are needed to determine the optimal treatment regime for this disease. The IL17/23 pathway may provide a novel therapeutic target to control inflammation in VKH syndrome.",31,2008-Jul-1

Tubulointerstitial nephritis and uveitis (TINU) syndrome is a rare oculorenal inflammatory condition that was first described in 1975. In 2001 a major review identified 133 cases in the world literature and proposed key diagnostic criteria for the condition. Although acknowledged as rare, the limited data available prevented reliable estimates of the prevalence of the condition, and hampered elucidation of the relationship between genetic and environmental factors that contribute to its pathogenesis.In this review we have performed a systematic search on the epidemiology, demographics and proposed risk factors for TINU. Estimates of prevalence based on studies that explicitly report TINU cases suggest that it is diagnosed in 0.2-2% of patients attending specialist uveitis services, with variation reflecting a number of factors including level of diagnostic certainty required. The prevalence of uveitis in patients with tubulointerstitial nephritis (TIN) may be higher than currently recognised, particularly in the paediatric population.The prevalence of TINU is higher in younger age groups and there is a female preponderance although this gender effect appears weaker than suggested by early studies. Although important genetic contributions have been proposed, the small size of studies and variation between reports currently preclude identification of a 'pro-TINU' haplotype. Drugs and infections have been proposed as the leading acquired risk factors for the development of TINU; whilst the small size of TINU cohorts and issues of study design limit interpretation of many studies. Larger datasets from the renal literature suggest that the majority of these cases are precipitated by a drug-induced hypersensitivity reaction; however in many ophthalmic cases no clear precipitant is identified.",31,2017-Jul-14

Uveitis is the most common extraarticular manifestation of juvenile idiopathic arthritis (JIA) and is associated with considerable morbidity. The aim of this study was to examine the risk factors associated with uveitis in JIA.
METHODS: We conducted a chart review of 1,047 patients with JIA from a single tertiary care pediatric rheumatology center for factors associated with the development of uveitis. Special emphasis was put on the following known risk factors: oligoarthritis, antinuclear antibody (ANA) status, sex, and age at the time of onset of JIA.
RESULTS: The risk of uveitis developing was age dependent in girls but not in boys. Among girls, the risk was maximal (47%) in those who were ANA positive and were ages 1-2 years at the time of the onset of JIA; this risk decreased to <10% in those in whom the age at onset was >7 years. Only girls had an age-dependent and ANA-associated increased risk of uveitis. The time interval from the diagnosis of JIA to the diagnosis of uveitis was statistically significantly longer in patients in whom the onset of JIA occurred at a younger age (P = 0.04). This effect was even more pronounced in ANA-positive patients (P = 0.004). The JIA subtype did not influence a patient's risk of the development of uveitis.
CONCLUSION: An age-associated risk of uveitis was observed only in girls who were younger than 7 years of age at the time of the onset of JIA. The duration of time between the diagnosis of JIA and the onset of uveitis was longer in patients in whom JIA was diagnosed at a younger age, especially in those who were ANA positive. We suggest that our findings have implications for uveitis screening in patients with JIA.",31,2010-Jun-1

To describe optical coherence tomography angiography (OCTA) findings in eyes with Behçet uveitis (BU) and to compare these findings with those of fluorescein angiography (FA).
METHODS: Prospective, comparative, cross-sectional study. Patients presenting with clinically active BU involving the posterior segment were evaluated using FA, spectral domain optical coherence tomography (SD-OCT), and OCTA. Optical coherence tomography angiograms were reviewed and analyzed. Foveal avascular zone areas and vessel densities were also reported.
RESULTS: Twenty-five patients (44 eyes) were included. Perifoveal microvascular changes were more frequently observed on OCTA than on FA (95.5 vs 59.1%; P < 0.001). Disruption of the perifoveal capillary arcade, areas of retinal capillary nonperfusion/hypoperfusion, and perifoveal capillary abnormalities, including rarefied, dilated, or shunting vessels were observed more frequently using OCTA than FA (40.9 vs 25%; P = 0.039, 86.4 vs 34.1%; P < 0.001, and 84.1 vs 36.4%; P < 0.001, respectively). Areas of retinal capillary nonperfusion/hypoperfusion were more frequently observed in the deep than in the superficial capillary plexus (81.8 vs 63.6%; P = 0.039). Capillary abnormalities and disorganization of the normal architecture of the capillary network were more frequent in the deep than in the superficial capillary plexus (P < 0.001). Foveal avascular zone area was not significantly larger in eyes with BU than in control group in both the superficial and the deep capillary plexuses (0.4 vs 0.34 mm; P = 0.23 and 0.72 vs 0.53 mm; P = 0.053, respectively). Capillary vessel density was significantly lower in eyes with BU than in control group in the deep capillary plexus (13.7 vs 17.2 mm 21; P = 0.004).
CONCLUSION: OCTA allows better visualization and characterization of perifoveal microvascular changes than FA in eyes with active BU. The deep capillary plexus seemed to be more severely involved than the superficial capillary plexus.",31,2017-Sep-1

To establish the causes of uveitis in immunocompromised patients and to determine the contribution of polymerase chain reaction (PCR) and Goldmann-Witmer coefficient (GWC) analysis of aqueous humor in patients with an infectious etiology.
DESIGN: Retrospective case series of 56 consecutive immunocompromised patients with uveitis.
METHODS: All patients underwent full ophthalmologic examination and laboratory blood analysis for uveitis. Aqueous humor analyses were performed using PCR and GWC for cytomegalovirus (CMV), herpes simplex virus (HSV), varicella zoster virus (VZV), and Toxoplasma gondii.
RESULTS: Of 56 immunocompromised patients, 43 (77%), all posterior and panuveitis, had intraocular infections. Twenty-one (49%) had CMV, three (7%) had VZV, 11 (26%) had T. gondii, six (14%) had Treponema pallidum, and one (2%) each had Aspergillus and Candida. In AIDS patients, CMV was the most common cause. A strong correlation between AIDS and ocular syphilis was also observed (P = .007). In nonAIDS immunocompromised patients, T. gondii was most frequently detected. Twenty-seven patients were examined by both PCR and GWC; five (18.5%) were positive by both assays, 15 (55.5%) were positive by PCR alone and seven (26%) by GWC alone. Viral infections were detected by PCR in 16 of 17 (94%) cases; T. gondii in four of 10 (40%) patients. Using GWC, a viral infection was diagnosed in three of 17 (18%) and T. gondii in nine of 10 (90%) cases.
CONCLUSIONS: In immunocompromised patients, PCR is superior in diagnosing viral infections. Analysis of intraocular antibody production played a decisive role in the diagnosis of ocular toxoplasmosis.",31,2007-Nov-1

Animal models of autoimmunity to the retina mimic specific features of human uveitis, but no model by itself reproduces the full spectrum of human disease. We compared three mouse models of uveitis that target the interphotoreceptor retinoid binding protein (IRBP): (i) the ""classical"" model of experimental autoimmune uveitis (EAU) induced by immunization with IRBP; (ii) spontaneous uveitis in IRBP T cell receptor transgenic mice (R161H) and (iii) spontaneous uveitis in Autoimmune Regulator (AIRE)(-/-) mice. Disease course and severity, pathology and changes in visual function were studied using fundus imaging and histological examinations, optical coherence tomography and electroretinography. All models were on the B10.RIII background. Unlike previously reported, IRBP-induced EAU in B10.RIII mice exhibited two distinct patterns of disease depending on clinical scores developed after onset: severe monophasic with extensive destruction of the retina and rapid loss of visual signal, or lower grade with a prolonged chronic phase culminating after several months in retinal degeneration and loss of vision. R161H and AIRE(-/-) mice spontaneously developed chronic progressive inflammation; visual function declined gradually as retinal degeneration developed. Spontaneous uveitis in R161H mice was characterized by persistent cellular infiltrates and lymphoid aggregation, whereas AIRE(-/-) mice characteristically developed multi-focal infiltrates and severe choroidal inflammation. These data demonstrate variability and unique distinguishing features in the different models of uveitis, suggesting that each one can represent distinct aspects of uveitis in humans.",31,2013-1-1

Behçet disease (BD) is a multisystem inflammatory disorder that is an important cause of morbidity worldwide. BD is most common along the ancient ""Silk Road"" route in the Far East and Mediterranean basin. The eye is the most commonly involved organ in BD patients.The prototypical form of involvement is a relapsing remitting panuveitis and retinal vasculitis. Less commonly, BD may present in the form of conjunctivitis, conjunctival ulcers, keratitis, episcleritis, scleritis, and extraocular muscle paralysis. Uveitis in BD carries significant implications for the patient, because it is a chronic recurrent disease characterized by explosive attacks of severe inflammation that may cause significant, cumulative damage to the intraocular structures. This review summarizes the epidemiology of systemic and ocular clinical features of BD with particular focus on risk factors, clinical characteristics, complications, and prognosis of BD-associated uveitis.",31,2012-Oct-1

To report the results of a retrospective analysis among endogenous uveitis patients in the north-eastern area of Italy.
METHODS: The authors reviewed a series of 655 new cases treated between October 1986 and December 1993. The incidence of endogenous uveitis was calculated based on a 100,000 patient population.
RESULTS: The average incidence was 11.40/100,000. The majority of patients were between the ages of 20 and 70 years (74.43%). A probable diagnosis was determined in 55.57% of cases; anterior uveitis was diagnosed in 58.01% of cases, posterior uveitis in 26.11%, panuveitis in 12.98%, and intermediate uveitis in 2.9% of cases. The authors observed recurrences in 25.49% of cases. While the first cases are almost equally distributed in the various months, the recurrences seem to be significantly more frequent in the cold (from November to February; mean air temperature <8 degrees) and transitional months (October and from March to May; mean air temperature from 8 degrees C to 18 degrees C) than in the warm months (from June to September; mean air temperature >18 degrees C). Respectively p=0.003 and p=0.029.
CONCLUSION: The incidence in this series is lower than in other European and American studies. Despite the high rate of idiopathic cases in this study, the authors support that the presentation of single case experiences may allow improved multi-centric analysis and a greater understanding of the epidemiology of uveitis.",31,2001-Feb-1

To analyze clinical features of the tubulointerstitial nephritis and uveitis (TINU) syndrome in Japan, especially exacerbations or recurrences of uveitis.
DESIGN: Retrospective observational study.
METHODS: We reviewed the clinical features in 12 patients with TINU syndrome diagnosed by renal biopsy, who were evaluated and treated at the Department of Ophthalmology, Hokkaido University Hospital. Visual acuity was measured using decimal visual acuity.
RESULTS: Patient age ranged from 10 to 33 years (mean 21 years), and females accounted for 83% of the cases. Both eyes were affected in 11 patients (92%). All 12 patients initially experienced ocular symptoms, with hyperemia being the chief complaint. We diagnosed patients as having uveitis and conducted blood tests and urinalysis. Urinalysis did show characteristic findings, most notably glucosuria, increased beta2 microglobulin that were > or = 10 times that of normal levels, and increased N-acetylglucosaminidose levels in a high percentage of patients. Recurrent or exacerbating uveitis was seen in six patients (50%). In exacerbated or recurrent uveitis, inflammation was more severe (> or = 3+ cells of the anterior eye segment). The ocular inflammation generally responded well to treatment with oral corticosteroids, and the number of recurrences was lower at corticosteroid doses of > or = prednisolone 40 mg.
CONCLUSIONS: Ophthalmologists play an important role in the initial discovery of patients with TINU syndrome. Because inflammation was more severe in exacerbated or recurrent uveitis, in instances where uveitis is refractory to local therapy, oral corticosteroids should be considered as early as possible.",31,2005-Oct-1

Mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) exhibit a potent immunomodulatory capacity and have been applied to treat diseases such as graft versus host disease and severe autoimmune diseases. However, the mechanism underlying their immunosuppressive effect is not yet completely understood. Here, we investigated the role of the CD73/adenosine pathway in immune modulation by MSCs using a mouse model of experimental autoimmune uveitis (EAU). Moreover, we examined the in vitro modulatory effect of MSCs mediated through the CD73/adenosine pathway in human and mouse T cells. We found that the severity of EAU was significantly attenuated by MSCs; however, most therapeutic effects of MSCs were lost by pretreatment with a CD73 inhibitor. The inhibitory mechanism of MSCs might be contributed by CD73 on MSCs that cooperated with CD39 and CD73 on activated T cells to produce adenosine, resulting in inhibition of T-cell proliferation. Furthermore, MSCs increased the expression of CD73 on CD4(+) T cells, and transforming growth factor-β1 (TGF-β1) was the only tested cytokine that contributed to upregulation of CD73. Hence, our study demonstrates that the CD73/adenosine pathway involves the immunomodulatory function of MSCs in autoimmune responses.",31,2016-Feb-15

Controversy exists regarding which cell types are responsible for autoantigen presentation in the retina during experimental autoimmune uveitis (EAU) development. In this study, we aimed to identify and characterize the retinal resident and infiltrating cells susceptible to express major histocompatibility complex (MHC) class II during EAU.
METHODS: EAU was induced in C57BL/6 mice by adoptive transfer of autoreactive lymphocytes from IRBP1-20-immunized animals. MHC class II expression was studied by immunostainings on eye cryosections. For flow cytometry (FC) analysis, retinas were dissected and enzymatically digested into single-cell suspensions. Three MHC class II
RESULTS: Immunostainings demonstrate strong induction of MHC class II expression in EAU, especially in the inner retina at the level of inflamed vessels, extending to the outer retinal layers and the subretinal space in severely inflamed eyes. Most MHC class II
CONCLUSION: Our results highlight the potential of cells of hematopoietic origin in local antigen presentation, whatever their Ly6C expression. Our work further provides a first transcriptomic study of MHC class II-expressing retinal cells during EAU and delivers a series of new candidate genes possibly implicated in the pathogenesis of retinal autoimmunity.",31,2017-Jul-18

Echinochrome is a pigment present in the shells and spines of sea urchins. It has been reported to have several biologic protective effects, including in experimental models of myocardial ischemia/reperfusion injury, for which the proposed mechanisms are scavenging reactive oxygen species (ROS) and chelating iron. Endotoxin-induced uveitis (EIU) is an animal model of acute anterior segment intraocular inflammation that is induced by the injection of lipopolysaccharide (LPS). In this study, the therapeutic effect of echinochrome was examined in uveitis using the EIU model.
METHODS: EIU was induced in Lewis rats via 200 μg subcutaneous injections of LPS from Escherichia coli. Echinochrome was administered intravenously in 10, 1, or 0.1 mg/kg doses suspended in PBS (controls were injected with PBS only). Twenty-four hours after LPS injection, the number of infiltrating cells and the protein concentration in aqueous humor were determined. Aqueous tumor necrosis factor α (TNF-α) concentration was quantified with enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay, eyes were stained with nuclear factor (NF) κB antibodies, and ROS production was determined by dihydroethidium staining in fresh frozen samples.
RESULTS: The number of inflammatory aqueous cells and protein levels were lower in the groups treated with 10 and 1 mg/kg of echinochrome than in the untreated LPS group (p<0.01). Treatment with 10 and 1 mg/kg of echinochrome significantly reduced TNF-α concentrations in aqueous humor (p<0.01). The numbers of NFκB-positive cells and ROS signals were also reduced by echinochrome administration (p<0.05).
CONCLUSIONS: Echinochrome ameliorated intraocular inflammation caused by EIU by reducing ROS production, thereby also decreasing the expression of NFκB and TNF-α.

Birdshot Uveitis (Birdshot) is a rare eye condition that affects HLA-A29-positive individuals and could be considered a prototypic member of the recently proposed 'MHC-I (major histocompatibility complex class I)-opathy' family. Genetic studies have pinpointed the endoplasmic reticulum aminopeptidase (ERAP1) and (ERAP2) genes as shared associations across MHC-I-opathies, which suggests ERAP dysfunction may be a root cause for MHC-I-opathies. We mapped the ERAP1 and ERAP2 haplotypes in 84 Dutch cases and 890 controls. We identified association at variant rs10044354, which mediated a marked increase in ERAP2 expression. We also identified and cloned an independently associated ERAP1 haplotype (tagged by rs2287987) present in more than half of the cases; this ERAP1 haplotype is also the primary risk and protective haplotype for other MHC-I-opathies. We show that the risk ERAP1 haplotype conferred significantly altered expression of ERAP1 isoforms in transcriptomic data (n = 360), resulting in lowered protein expression and distinct enzymatic activity. Both the association for rs10044354 (meta-analysis: odds ratio (OR) [95% CI]=2.07[1.58-2.71], P = 1.24 × 10(-7)) and rs2287987 (OR[95% CI]: =2.01[1.51-2.67], P = 1.41 × 10(-6)) replicated and showed consistent direction of effect in an independent Spanish cohort of 46 cases and 2103 controls. In both cohorts, the combined rs2287987-rs10044354 haplotype associated with Birdshot more strongly than either variant alone [meta-analysis: P=3.9 × 10(-9)]. Finally, we observed that ERAP2 protein expression is dependent on the ERAP1 background across three European populations (n = 3353). In conclusion, a functionally distinct combination of ERAP1 and ERAP2 are a hallmark of Birdshot and provide rationale for strategies designed to correct ERAP function for treatment of Birdshot and MHC-I-opathies more broadly.",31,2018-Dec-15

Uveitis is a major cause of visual impairment throughout the world. Analysis of cytokine profiles in aqueous humor specimens may provide insight into the physiopathological processes that underly retinal damage in this context.
METHODS: Using a multiplex assay, we determined the concentrations of 17 cytokines and chemokines in aqueous humor specimens obtained from patients with ocular toxoplasmosis or viral uveitis and compared these concentrations with those in specimens obtained from patients with noninfectious intermediate uveitis or cataract.
RESULTS: Five mediators (interleukin [IL]-8, monocyte chemoattractant protein-1, tumor necrosis factor-alpha, IL-4, and IL-10) were detected in >50% of patients in all groups. In contrast, IL-5 and IL-12 were specific for ocular toxoplasmosis, and granulocyte monocyte colony-stimulating factor and IL-1 were specific for viral uveitis; these mediators could present specific markers for diagnostic purposes. Interferon-gamma, IL-6, and macrophage inflammatory protein-1beta were common markers of ocular toxoplasmosis and viral uveitis. IL-17 was a common marker of ocular toxoplasmosis and intermediate uveitis.
CONCLUSIONS: We found specific cytokine profiles for each type of uveitis, with large interindividual variations and no etiological or clinical correlations. Ocular cytokine mapping contributes to a better understanding of the physiopathology of specific forms of uveitis and provides guidance for new targeted treatment.",31,2009-Apr-15

There is a paucity of data on the ocular outcomes in paediatric non-infectious uveitis since the introduction of the biologic agents. The purpose of this study was to outline the clinical characteristics of children with non-infectious uveitis and determine the visual outcomes and ocular complication rates in the modern era.
METHODS: Children with non-infectious uveitis from January 2011 to December 2015 were identified. Data was collected at baseline, 1, 3, 5, and 10 years post diagnosis. The incidence rates of visual impairment, structural ocular complications and surgical intervention were calculated. Using logistic regression the association between various baseline characteristics and later visual impairment was investigated.
RESULTS: Of the 166 children, 60.2% (n = 100) had a systemic disease association. 72.9% (n = 121) children received methotrexate, 58 children progressed to a biologic. The incidence rates of visual acuity loss to > 0.3 LogMAR (6/12) and to ≥1.0 LogMAR (6/60) were 0.05/Eye Year (EY) and 0.01/EY, respectively. Visual outcomes in the Juvenile Idiopathic Arthritis associated Uveitis (JIA-U) and Idiopathic Uveitis cohorts were not statistically significant. Of the 293 affected eyes, posterior synechiae was the predominant complication on presentation, while cataract had the highest incidence rate (0.05/EY). On direct comparison, children with JIA-U were statistically significantly more likely to develop glaucoma while children with Idiopathic Uveitis were statistically significantly more likely to develop macular oedema.
CONCLUSION: One third of children received a biological therapy, reflecting increasing utilisation and importance of biological agents in the management of inflammatory conditions. Rates of visual impairment and ocular complications are an improvement on previously published data.",31,2018-Aug-06

The aim of this study was to investigate the effect of anti-mouse IL-6 receptor monoclonal antibody (MR16-1) treatment on CD4 T cell differentiation and compared it to the effect of anti-TNF mAb treatment with using a murine model of experimental autoimmune uveoretinitis (EAU). C57BL/6 mice were immunized with interphotoreceptor retinoid-binding protein (IRBP) to induce ocular inflammation treatment with control IgG or MR16-1 or anti-TNF mAb. Helper T cells differentiation was analyzed during the development of EAU. Immunization with IRBP increased the frequency of Th17 cells rather than Th1 cells in the early stage of EAU. Treatment with MR16-1 on the same day as immunization (day 0) or one day after (day 1) suppressed ocular inflammation in EAU mice. Treatment with MR16-1 on day 0 inhibited the induction of Th17 cells in vivo, and inhibited not only IRBP-responsive Th17 cells but also their Th1 counterparts and induced IRBP-responsive regulatory T (Treg) cells in vitro. The administration of anti-TNF mAb had no significant protective effect in EAU mice. The protective effect of anti-IL-6R mAb treatment, but not anti-TNF mAb treatment on EAU correlated with the inhibition of Th17 differentiation. This finding suggests that IL-6 blockade may have a therapeutic effect on human ocular inflammation which is mediated via mechanisms distinct from those of TNF blockade. IL-6 blockade may thus represent an alternative therapy for patients with ocular inflammation who are refractory to anti-TNF mAb therapy.",30,2010-Aug-1

Juvenile idiopathic arthritis (JIA) is the commonest rheumatic disease in children and JIA-associated uveitis its most frequent extra-articular manifestation. The uveitis is potentially sight-threatening and so carries a considerable risk of morbidity. The commonest form of uveitis seen in JIA is chronic anterior uveitis which is almost always asymptomatic in the initial stages. Therefore, screening for JIA-associated uveitis in at-risk patients is essential. The aim of early detection and treatment is to minimise intra-ocular inflammation and avoid complications leading to visual loss, resulting from both disease activity and medications. There is increasing evidence for the early introduction of systemic immunosuppressive therapies in order to reduce topical and systemic glucocorticoid use. Two randomised controlled trials of adalimumab in JIA-associated uveitis provide convincing evidence for the use of this biologic in patients who fail to respond adequately to methotrexate. Tocilizumab and baricitinib are being investigated as alternatives to anti-tumour necrosis factor drugs.",30,2020-Feb-1

This report describes a retrospective study of all new patients in our uveitis clinic between January 1992 and December 1994, undertaken to identify the pattern of uveitis in the Indian subcontinent. A standard clinical protocol, and the naming-meshing system with tailored laboratory investigations were used to arrive at a final uveitic diagnosis. Uveitis comprised 1.5% of new cases seen at the centre. Out of 1,273 uveitis cases, anterior uveitis was the most common type (39.28%), followed by posterior uveitis (28.75%), intermediate uveitis (17.44%), and panuveitis (14.53%). The most commonly affected age group were patients in their forties (23.57%). Uveitis was less common in children below 10 years (3.61%) and in adults over 60 years of age (6.44%). Men (62.21%) were more commonly affected than women (37.79%). Aetiology remained undetermined in 59.31% of cases. Anterior uveitis was most commonly idiopathic (58.6%). The most common cause of posterior uveitis was toxoplasmosis (27.87%), and that of panuveitis was the Vogt-Koyanagi-Harada syndrome (21.08%). A higher incidence of microbiologically proven tubercular uveitis (5 cases), and uveitis due to live intraocular nematode (4 cases), and malaria (1 case), were seen, in contrast to other studies. Only 2 cases of AIDS with ocular lesions were seen. This paper reveals the pattern of uveitis seen at a major referral eye institute in India.",30,N/A-1-1

Intraocular tuberculosis is a rare disease. Only approximately 18 cases of microbiologically or histopathologically proven cases of intraocular tuberculosis have been reported.
METHODS: Between 1984 and 1994, five cases of intraocular tuberculosis were confirmed microbiologically and histopathologically from intraocular specimens in the authors' uveitis clinic. Systemic antitubercular treatment was instituted, along with the treatment for the ocular inflammation.
RESULTS: Clinical presentation included subretinal abscess (two cases), granulomatous anterior uveitis with scleral perforation, an exudative mass in the anterior chamber, and choroidal mass with panuveitis (one case each). Aqueous aspirate in three patients and eviscerated material in the other two showed presence of acid fast bacilli. One globe that required enucleation revealed granulomatous inflammation with caseation necrosis. Two patients showed a significant response to antitubercular therapy, whereas the other three patients eventually required evisceration or enucleation.
CONCLUSIONS: Intraocular tuberculosis can have protean manifestations and variable response to systemic antitubercular therapy.",30,1995-1-1

To develop a set of core outcome measures for use in randomized controlled trials (RCTs) and longitudinal observational studies in juvenile idiopathic arthritis (JIA)-associated uveitis.
METHODS: The literature relating to outcome measures used in studies of uveitis in childhood and adolescence was reviewed. A set of core outcomes and domains was established using the Delphi process. This was reviewed by a representative multinational interdisciplinary working group. Nominal group technique consensus was reached on face and content validity of the range and content of the domains. The outcomes and the appropriate instruments for uveitis trials were adapted to the age ranges of patients with JIA-associated uveitis.
RESULTS: Consensus was reached that data should be reported at defined time points in longitudinal studies with patients stratified by prognostic markers. Visual acuity testing should be age appropriate. The severity of uveitis (measured as anterior chamber cell grade) and duration of active inflammation should be documented. Visually significant structural complications should be recorded and quantified with standard measures. The responses to treatment and corticosteroid-sparing effects of treatment should be documented. Patient-reported disease activity and age-specific uveitis-related quality of life should be reported using appropriate questionnaires.
CONCLUSION: The proposed outcome measures in JIA-associated uveitis should aid in the standardization and comparison of future RCTs of the treatment regimens for this disease. The proposed outcome measures will be verified in a prospective validation study.",30,2012-Sep-1

To compare the efficacy of infliximab (IFX) versus adalimumab (ADA) as a first-line biologic drug over 1 year of treatment in a large series of patients with refractory uveitis due to Behçet's disease (BD).
METHODS: We conducted an open-label multicenter study of IFX versus ADA for BD-related uveitis refractory to conventional nonbiologic treatment. IFX or ADA was chosen as the first-line biologic agent based on physician and patient agreement. Patients received 3-5 mg/kg intravenous IFX at 0, 2, and 6 weeks and every 4-8 weeks thereafter, or 40 mg subcutaneous ADA every other week without a loading dose. Ocular parameters were compared between the 2 groups.
RESULTS: The study included 177 patients (316 affected eyes), of whom 103 received IFX and 74 received ADA. There were no significant baseline differences between treatment groups in main demographic features, previous therapy, or ocular sign severity. After 1 year of therapy, we observed an improvement in all ocular parameters in both groups. However, patients receiving ADA had significantly better outcomes in some parameters, including improvement in anterior chamber inflammation (92.31% versus 78.18% for IFX; P = 0.06), improvement in vitritis (93.33% versus 78.95% for IFX; P = 0.04), and best-corrected visual acuity (mean ± SD 0.81 ± 0.26 versus 0.67 ± 0.34 for IFX; P = 0.001). A nonsignificant difference was seen for macular thickness (mean ± SD 250.62 ± 36.85 for ADA versus 264.89 ± 59.74 for IFX; P = 0.15), and improvement in retinal vasculitis was similar between the 2 groups (95% for ADA versus 97% for IFX; P = 0.28). The drug retention rate was higher in the ADA group (95.24% versus 84.95% for IFX; P = 0.042).
CONCLUSION: Although both IFX and ADA are efficacious in refractory BD-related uveitis, ADA appears to be associated with better outcomes than IFX after 1 year of follow-up.",30,2019-Dec-1

To review the epidemiology, pathogenesis and management of uveitic glaucoma in the light of significant studies published during the review period (October 2002-2003).
RECENT FINDINGS: The visual prognosis of glaucoma secondary to certain types of uveitis, for example Juvenile Idopathic Arthritis, remains poor because of late presentation and a high rate of corticosteroid responsiveness. Production of Myocilin is intimately linked with outflow resistance and corticosteroid responsiveness. Although Myocilin gene expression is widespread in the eye, corticosteroid-induction is specific for trabecular meshwork. The hypotensive effect of some glaucoma medications such as Latanoprost and Brimonidine may be partially blocked by concurrent administration of NSAIDs, though the risk of redcrudescence of uveitis with Latanoprost appears to be much lower than initially feared. Use of Mitomycin C in uveitic trabeculectomy has not clearly translated into better long-term IOP control, though this may be due to an absence of prospective studies. Glaucoma drainage devices appear to be more successful in uveitic glaucoma than in other recalcitrant types.
SUMMARY: The management of uveitic glaucoma requires a careful balance between adequate anti-inflammatory therapy and appropriate intraocular pressure (IOP)-lowering to prevent long-term visual loss. In the foreseeable future, successful elucidation of the function of Myocilin is most likely to lead to improvements in the management of corticosteroid-induced and hence uveitic glaucoma.",30,2004-Apr-1

Eleven (10.7%) of 103 patients with intraocular foreign bodies had endophthalmitis develop. Final visual acuity was 20/200 or better in eight (42.1%) of 19 and 20/30 or better in five (26.3%) of 19 cases of posttraumatic endophthalmitis. Organisms cultured were similar to those in the other types of endophthalmitis, except that Bacillus species were seen only in posttraumatic endophthalmitis (five [26.3%] of 19). Virulent organisms or retinal breaks or detachments seen at the time of primary repair indicated poor prognoses.",30,1984-Apr-1

The granulomatous uveitis, multifocal choroiditis and periphlebitis have been suspected to be of tubercular origin but no definitive reports about detection of etiological agents have been documented in the literature. Conventional bacteriological methods are not generally helpful in diagnosing ocular tuberculosis due to difficulty with potential morbidity associated with obtaining the biopsy material from the eye. Thus, the diagnosis of ocular tuberculosis is most often presumptive.
OBJECTIVE: We evaluated the role of polymerase chain reaction (PCR) for detection of Mycobacterium tuberculosis in the aqueous humor samples obtained from eyes with active uveitis.
METHODS: Aqueous samples from 53 patients having cellular reaction in the anterior chamber along with any one or more of the following: 1) active vasculitis; 2) anterior vitreous cells; 3) snowball opacities; 4) snow banking in the pars plana; 5) retinochoroiditis were withdrawn by anterior chamber paracentesis and subjected to PCR. Seventeen samples from patients with definite clinical diagnoses other than tuberculosis formed a disease control group. Fifteen aqueous samples obtained from healthy subjects undergoing routine cataract surgery served as healthy controls. PCR was performed using primers capable of amplifying a 150 b.p. segment from a conserved repetitive sequence in the genome of M. tuberculosis.
RESULTS: Twenty out of the 53 samples (37.7%) in the study group were positive where as only one sample out of 17 in the disease control group (5.7%) showed a weakly positive band. No sample from the healthy control group showed a positive PCR.
CONCLUSION: Our study shows that PCR can be effectively used for the diagnosis of intraocular tuberculosis in the presence of uveitis.",30,1999-1-1

To determine the role of the QuantiFERON-TB Gold In-Tube (QFT) (Cellestis Inc., Carnegie, Australia) assay in the diagnosis of tuberculosis (TB) uveitis.
DESIGN: Retrospective cohort study.
PARTICIPANTS: The study included 157 patients with suspected TB uveitis seen over an 18-month period (August 1, 2006, to February 31, 2007) at the Singapore National Eye Center (SNEC) uveitis clinic.
METHODS: We identified all cases of suspected TB uveitis in the above-mentioned time period and reviewed all medical records of the cases. Clinical findings, type of treatment instituted, response to treatment, and results of investigations such as QFT, tuberculin skin test (TST), and chest x-rays were recorded. A novel method of using treatment response to determine the presumed diagnosis of TB was used to estimate the accuracy of QFT and TST.
MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: The positive likelihood ratio (LR+), negative likelihood ratio (LR-), and area under the receiver operator characteristic curve (ROC) of the investigations were estimated.
RESULTS: QFT is not superior to the TST in sensitivity as a screening test or first-line study in TB-related uveitis; however, QFT is more specific than the TST in identifying infections by Mycobacterium tuberculosis. Negative QFT tests should be interpreted with caution, because they do not exclude the diagnosis.
CONCLUSIONS: The new QFT is only slightly superior to the TST in the diagnosis of TB uveitis. Thus, there is an important role for interpreting the QFT together with the TST. This is the first and largest study of its kind to evaluate the use of QFT in the clinical diagnosis of TB uveitis.",30,2009-Jul-1

Vogt-Koyanagi-Harada (VKH) disease is a primary autoimmune granulomatous choroiditis that begins in the choroidal stroma. The aim of this review was to gather a body of evidence for the concept of a window of therapeutic opportunity, defined as a time interval following initial-onset disease during which adequate treatment will substantially modify the disease outcome and possibly even lead to cure, similar to what has been described for rheumatoid arthritis.
METHODS: We reviewed the literature and consulted leading experts in VKH disease to determine the consensus for the notion of a therapeutic window of opportunity in VKH disease.
RESULTS: We found a substantial body of evidence in the literature that a therapeutic window of opportunity exists for initial-onset acute uveitis associated with VKH disease. The disease outcome can be substantially improved if dual systemic steroidal and non-steroidal immunosuppressants are given within 2-3 weeks of the onset of initial VKH disease, avoiding evolution to chronic disease and development of ""sunset glow fundus."" Several studies additionally report series in which the disease could be cured, using such an approach.
CONCLUSIONS: There is substantial evidence for a therapeutic window of opportunity in initial-onset acute VKH disease. Timely and adequate treatment led to substantial improvement of disease outcome and prevented chronic evolution and ""sunset glow fundus,"" and very early treatment led to the cure after discontinuation of therapy in several series, likely due to the fact that the choroid is the sole origin of inflammation in VKH disease.",30,2019-Jun-1

The Ebola outbreak of 2013-2016 severely affected West Africa and resulted in 2544 deaths and 1270 survivors in Guinea, the country where it began. This Ebola virus was the Zaire strain of the virus family Filoviridae. In this outbreak the case fatality rate was about 67%. The survivors, declared cured after 2 negative blood polymerase chain reaction (PCR) results, face psychosocial disorders and rheumatic, ear-nose-throat, neurocognitive, and ophthalmologic complications. The goal of this study was to detect and describe ocular complications afflicting these survivors and to observe their occurrence and recurrences.
DESIGN: Prospective observational cohort study.
METHODS: This prospective observational multicenter cohort study was initiated in March 2015. The cohort study included 341 survivors followed up in the infectious disease ward of Conakry, Forecariah, and Nzérékoré as of May 2016. The patients received multidisciplinary medical follow-up expected to last at least 1 year that included an eye examination as part of complete, free treatment.
RESULTS: Systematic examination of 341 patients revealed 46 cases of uveitis (13.5%), 6 cases of episcleritis (1.8%), and 3 cases of interstitial keratitis (0.9%). Uveitis was most frequently unilateral (78.3%) and anterior (47.8%) and occurred within the 2 months after discharge from the Ebola treatment center. Moreover, uveitis relapses were found up to 13 months after the negative PCR result for Ebola in the blood.
CONCLUSION: Nearly 1 out of 6 survivors presented ocular disorders after discharge from the Ebola treatment center. An ophthalmologic follow-up for Ebola-infected patients should start, if possible, during the acute phase of the disease and last more than 1 year. Treatment guidelines need to be urgently developed and implemented.",30,2017-Mar-1

To analyze visual outcome, effectiveness of various modes of antibiotic treatment, and prognostic factors in patients with serologically proven syphilitic uveitis.
METHODS: The clinical records of 85 patients (139 eyes) diagnosed with syphilitic uveitis between 1984 and 2013 at tertiary centers in The Netherlands were retrospectively analyzed.
RESULTS: Mean age was 47 years (range, 27-73 years), 82.4% were male. HIV positivity was found in 28 (35.9%) patients; 13 were newly diagnosed. Most patients had pan (45.9%) or posterior (31.8%) uveitis. On average, logMAR visual acuity (VA) improved significantly from 0.55 at the start of syphilis treatment to 0.34 at 1 month and to 0.27 at 6 months follow-up. Most patients (86.7%) reached disease remission. No differences in efficacy between the various treatment regimens were found. A high logMAR VA at the start of syphilis treatment and a treatment delay of more than 12 weeks were prognostic for a high logMAR VA at 6 months follow-up. Chronicity was not related to any form of treatment, HIV status, or Venereal Disease Research Laboratory test outcome.
CONCLUSIONS: In this large cohort of 85 patients with syphilitic uveitis, visual outcomes were favorable in the majority of cases. Visual outcome was dependent on VA at the start of syphilis treatment and treatment delay.",29,2016-Feb-1

The aim of the present study was to evaluate the effect of conditioned medium from human uterine cervical stem cells (CM-hUCESCs) in uveitis. To do that, uveitis was induced in rats after footpad injection of Escherichia coli lipopolysaccaride (LPS). Human retinal pigment epithelial (ARPE-19) cells after LPS challenge were used to test anti-inflammatory effect of CM-hUCESCs 'ìn vitro'. Real-time PCR was used to evaluate mRNA expression levels of the pro-inflammatory cytokines interkeukin-6, interkeukin-8, macrophage inflammatory protein-1 alpha, tumor necrosis factor alpha, and the anti-inflammatory interkeukin-10. Leucocytes from aqueous humor (AqH) were quantified in a Neubauer chamber, and eye histopathological analysis was done with hematoxylin-eosin staining. Additionally, using a human cytokine antibody array we evaluated CM-hUCESCs to determine mediating proteins. Results showed that administration of CM-hUCESCs significantly reduced LPS-induced pro-inflammatory cytokines both 'in vitro' and 'in vivo', and decreased leucocytes in AqH and ocular tissues. High levels of cytokines with anti-inflammatory effects were found in CM-hUCESCs, suggesting a possible role of these factors in reducing intraocular inflammation. In summary, treatment with CM-hUCESCs significantly reduces inflammation in uveitis. Our data indicate that CM-hUCESCs could be regarded as a potential therapeutic agent for patients suffering from ocular inflammation.",29,2016-Aug-1

Uveitis is a potentially sight-threatening complication of juvenile idiopathic arthritis (JIA). JIA-associated uveitis is recognized to have an autoimmune aetiology characterized by activation of CD4(+) T cells, but the underlying mechanisms might overlap with those of autoinflammatory conditions involving activation of innate immunity. As no animal model recapitulates all the features of JIA-associated uveitis, questions remain regarding its pathogenesis. The most common form of JIA-associated uveitis is chronic anterior uveitis, which is usually asymptomatic initially. Effective screening is, therefore, essential to detect early disease and commence treatment before the development of visually disabling complications, such as cataracts, glaucoma, band keratopathy and cystoid macular oedema. Complications can result from uncontrolled intraocular inflammation as well as from its treatment, particularly prolonged use of high-dose topical corticosteroids. Accumulating evidence supports the early introduction of systemic immunosuppressive drugs, such as methotrexate, as steroid-sparing agents. Prospective randomized controlled trials of TNF inhibitors and other biologic therapies are underway or planned. Future research should aim to identify biomarkers to predict which children are at high risk of developing JIA-associated uveitis or have a poor prognosis. Such biomarkers could help to ensure that patients receive earlier interventions and more-potent therapy, with the ultimate aim of reducing loss of vision and ocular morbidity.",29,2015-Jun-1

To compare the benefits of fluocinolone acetonide implant therapy versus systemic corticosteroid therapy supplemented (when indicated) with immunosuppression for intermediate uveitis, posterior uveitis, and panuveitis.
DESIGN: Additional follow-up of a randomized comparative effectiveness trial cohort.
PARTICIPANTS: Two hundred fifty-five patients with intermediate uveitis, posterior uveitis, or panuveitis randomized to implant or systemic therapy.
MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Best-corrected visual acuity (BCVA), visual field mean deviation (MD), activity of uveitis, and presence of macular edema (per reading center grading) ascertained prospectively.
METHODS: Trial participants were followed-up for 54 months from original randomization.
RESULTS: The visual function trajectory in uveitic eyes demonstrated a similar (P = 0.73) degree of modest (not statistically significant) improvement from baseline to 54 months in both groups (mean improvement in BCVA at 54 months, 2.4 and 3.1 letters in the implant and systemic groups, respectively). Many had excellent initial visual acuity, limiting the potential for improvement. The mean automated perimetry MD score remained similar to baseline throughout 48 months of follow-up in both groups. Overall control of inflammation was superior in the implant group at every time point assessed (P < 0.016), although most eyes in the systemic therapy arm also showed substantial improvement, achieving complete control or low levels of inflammation. Although macular edema improved significantly more often with implant treatment within the first 6 months, the systemic group gradually improved over time such that the proportions with macular edema converged in the 2 groups by 36 months and overlapped thereafter (P = 0.41 at 48 months).
CONCLUSIONS: Visual outcomes of fluocinolone acetonide implant and systemic treatment for intermediate uveitis, posterior uveitis, and panuveitis were similarly favorable through 54 months. The implant maintained a clear advantage in controlling inflammation through 54 months. Nevertheless, with systemic therapy, most patients also experienced greatly improved inflammatory status. Macular edema improved equally with longer follow-up. Based on cost effectiveness and side-effect considerations, systemic therapy may be indicated as the initial treatment for many bilateral uveitis cases. However, implant therapy is a reasonable alternative, especially for unilateral cases and when systemic therapy is not feasible or is not successful.",29,2015-Oct-1

Myeloid cells make a pivotal contribution to tissue homeostasis during inflammation. Both tissue-specific resident populations and infiltrating myeloid cells can cause tissue injury through aberrant activation and/or dysregulated activity. Reliable identification and quantification of myeloid cells within diseased tissues is important to understand pathological inflammatory processes. Flow cytometry is a valuable technique for leukocyte analysis, but a standardized flow cytometric method for myeloid cell populations in the eye is lacking. Here, we validate a reproducible flow cytometry gating approach to characterize myeloid cells in several commonly used models of ocular inflammation. We profile and quantify myeloid subsets across these models, and highlight the value of this strategy in identifying phenotypic differences using Ccr2-deficient mice. This method will aid standardization in the field and facilitate future investigations into the roles of myeloid cells during ocular inflammation.",29,2016-Oct-1

Autoimmune uveitis (AU), an inflammatory non-infectious process of the vascular layer of the eye, can lead to visual impairment and, in the absence of a timely diagnosis and suitable therapy, can even result in total blindness. The majority of AU cases are idiopathic, whereas fewer than 20 % are associated with systemic diseases. The clinical severity of AU depends on whether the anterior, intermediate, or posterior part of the uvea is involved and may range from almost asymptomatic to rapidly sight-threatening forms. Race, genetic background, and environmental factors can also influence the clinical picture. The pathogenetic mechanism of AU is still poorly defined, given its remarkable heterogeneity and the many discrepancies between experimental and human uveitis. Even so, the onset of AU is thought to be related to an aberrant T cell-mediated immune response, triggered by inflammation and directed against retinal or cross-reactive antigens. B cells may also play a role in uveal antigen presentation and in the subsequent activation of T cells. The management of AU remains a challenge for clinicians, especially because of the paucity of randomized clinical trials that have systematically evaluated the effectiveness of different drugs. In addition to topical treatment, several different therapeutic options are available, although a standardized regimen is thus far lacking. Current guidelines recommend corticosteroids as the first-line therapy for patients with active AU. Immunosuppressive drugs may be subsequently required to treat steroid-resistant AU and for steroid-sparing purposes. The recent introduction of biological agents, such as those targeting tumor necrosis factor-α, is expected to remarkably increase the percentages of responders and to prevent irreversible sight impairment. This paper reviews the clinical features of AU and its crucial pathogenetic targets in relation to the current therapeutic perspectives. Also, the largest clinical trials conducted in the last 12 years for the treatment of AU are summarized and critically discussed.",29,2016-May-1

OX2 is a member of the immunoglobulin superfamily expressed on a broad range of tissues including neurons of the central and peripheral nervous systems, thymocytes, and endothelium. The recently identified OX2 receptor (OX2R) is restricted to the surfaces of myeloid lineage cells, including microglia. Functional data have implicated the OX2-OX2R interaction as a myeloid downregulatory signal. The purpose of this study was to determine the distribution and extent of expression of OX2 and its receptor within the retina, a tissue developed to restrain immune-mediated inflammatory damage.
METHODS: OX2 and OX2R monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) were used to determine OX2 and OX2R protein expression, respectively, by flow cytometry of isolated myeloid-derived cells from normal and inflamed rat retina and by immunohistochemistry of serial sections of rat retina. For comparison, distribution of OX2 was documented using species-specific monoclonal antibodies in mouse and human retina. No OX2R mAbs are available for mouse or human detection.
RESULTS: OX2 was expressed on retinal vascular endothelium and glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP)-negative neurons in retina and optic nerve and on a subpopulation of CD45(+) perivascular and juxtavascular cells. Within normal retina, OX2R was not detected on myeloid-derived cells. During experimental autoimmune uveoretinitis (EAU), expression of both OX2 and OX2R was noted on infiltrating leukocytes.
CONCLUSIONS: Taking these results of the distribution of OX2 in normal and OX2R in inflamed retina with other functional data of OX2-OX2R interaction, it is suggested that the OX2-OX2R interaction has the potential to contribute to a novel pathway that suppresses and limits immunologic inflammatory damage within the retina.",29,2001-Jan-1

Intraocular inflammatory disease, or uveitis, appears to be due in large part to non-infectious, cell-mediated mechanisms. Experimental autoimmune uveitis (EAU) has been a valuable tool to better understand underlying mechanisms of this disorder, and it provides the possibility to evaluate new approaches to immunotherapy as well. Two approaches described here are oral tolerance and anti-IL2 receptor therapy. Both therapies were evaluated in the animal model and showed positive therapeutic effects. Based on these observations, both approaches were used in the treatment of patients with uveitis. Oral tolerance showed initial promising results. Anti-IL2 receptor therapy has been used for over 4 years in uveitis patients with an additional study evaluating this therapy in Behçet's disease. Future plans are to expand this approach to a larger number of patients. The use of animal models has been very useful in better understanding mechanisms of ocular disease and bringing new therapeutic approaches to the clinic.",29,2002-1-1

Eight patients with bilateral sight-threatening posterior uveitis of non-infectious aetiology that had not responded to corticosteroid or cytotoxic therapy were given cyclosporin A. Seven of the eight responded with improvement in visual acuity and disappearance of ocular inflammatory activity. The seven included two with Behçet's disease, who also had improvement in non-ocular symptoms. Peripheral blood lymphocytes from the seven cyclosporin A responsive patients, but not those from the non-responder, gave positive in-vitro blastogenic responses to the retinal S-antigen, a highly uveitogenic organ-specific material. In four patients OKT4/OKT8 ratios fell after the start of therapy, as the result of an increase in the OKT8 fraction. In the other four patients the fall was preceded by an increase in the OKT4/OKT8 ratio. Cyclosporin A did not influence natural killer cell activity. Side-effects ascribed to cyclosporin A were tolerated or disappeared with continued therapy, sometimes at a lower dosage. No neoplasms were observed. Cyclosporin A seems to be effective treatment for selected patients with severe bilateral uveitis of non-infectious aetiology.",29,1983-Jul-30

The present article reviews the epidemiology, pathogenesis, clinical features, diagnosis, and treatment of ankylosing spondylitis and its association with ocular changes. The authors used the PubMed (MEDLINE), LILACS, and Ophthalmology Library databases. Ankylosing spondylitis is a chronic inflammatory disease that usually affects the axial skeleton and can progress to stiffness and progressive functional limitation. Ankylosing spondylitis usually begins around the second to third decade of life, preferentially in HLA-B27-positive white males. Its etiology and pathogenesis are not completely understood, and its diagnosis is difficult. Clinical control and treatment are frequently satisfactory. Acute anterior uveíte is the most common extra-articular manifestation, occurring in 20%-30% of the patients with ankylosing spondylitis. Approximately half of the acute anterior uveíte cases are associated with the presence of the HLA-B27 antigen. It can be the first manifestation of an undiagnosed rheumatic disease, usually having a good prognosis and appropriate response to treatment. In conclusion, for better assessment and treatment of patients with uveitis, ophthalmologists and rheumatologists should work together.",29,2012-Oct-1

Since the introduction of West Nile virus in the Western Hemisphere in 1999, the incidence of human infection has increased dramatically. As this virus spreads westward across the United States, ophthalmologists should be aware of this presently uncommon but important condition. Systemic features of West Nile virus infection are well characterized; however, the ophthalmic presentations are not widely known. Intraocular involvement with West Nile virus infection was first described in February 2003, and a variety of ophthalmic manifestations have since been recognized.

Corticosteroids remain the mainstay of the management of patients with uveitis. Topical corticosteroids are effective in the control of anterior uveitis, but vary in strength, ocular penetration and side effect profile. Systemic corticosteroids are widely used for the management of posterior segment inflammation which requires treatment, particularly when it is associated with systemic disease or when bilateral ocular disease is present. However, when ocular inflammation is unilateral, or is active in one eye only, local therapy has considerable advantages, and periocular injections of corticosteroid are a useful alternative to systemic medication and are very effective in controlling mild or moderate intraocular inflammation. More recently, the injection of intraocular corticosteroids such as triamcinolone have been found to be effective in reducing macular oedema and improving vision in uveitic eyes which have proved refractory to systemic or periocular corticosteroids. The effect is usually transient, lasting around 3 months, but can be repeated although the side effects of cataract and raised intraocular pressure are increased in frequency with intraocular versus periocular corticosteroid injections. This has led to the development of new intraocular corticosteroid devices which are designed to deliver sustained-release drugs and obviate the need for systemic immunosuppressive treatment. The first such implant was Retisert, which is surgically implanted (in the operating theatre) and is designed to release fluocinolone over a period of about 30 months. More recently, Ozurdex, a 'bioerodible' dexamethasone implant which can be inserted in an office setting, has completed phase III clinical trials in patients with intermediate and posterior uveitis. This implant lasts approximately 6 months, and has been found to be effective with a much better side effect profile than Retisert or intravitreal triamcinolone injection, at least for one injection.",29,2010-1-1

Neovascular retinal disease is a leading cause of blindness orchestrated by inflammatory responses. Although noninfectious uveoretinitis is mediated by CD4(+) T cells, in the persistent phase of disease, angiogenic responses are observed, along with degeneration of the retina. Full clinical manifestation relies on myeloid-derived cells, which are phenotypically distinct from, but potentially sharing common effector responses to age-related macular degeneration. To interrogate inflammation-mediated angiogenesis, we investigated experimental autoimmune uveoretinitis, an animal model for human uveitis. After the initial acute phase of severe inflammation, the retina sustains a persistent low-grade inflammation with tissue-infiltrating leukocytes for over 4 months. During this persistent phase, angiogenesis is observed as retinal neovascular membranes that arise from inflamed venules and postcapillary venules, increase in size as the disease progresses, and are associated with infiltrating arginase-1(+) macrophages. In the absence of thrombospondin-1, retinal neovascular membranes are markedly increased and are associated with arginase-1(-) CD68(+) macrophages, whereas deletion of the chemokine receptor CCR2 resulted in reduced retinal neovascular membranes in association with a predominant neutrophil infiltrate. CCR2 is important for macrophage recruitment to the retina in experimental autoimmune uveoretinitis and promotes chronicity in the form of a persistent angiogenesis response, which in turn is regulated by constitutive expression of angiogenic inhibitors like thrombospondin-1. This model offers a new platform to dissect the molecular and cellular pathology of inflammation-induced ocular angiogenesis.",29,2012-Jan-1

To report the occurrence of uveitis in patients with prior history of dengue fever.
METHODS: A case series of patients with uveitis, presenting with ocular symptoms 3-5 months after contracting dengue fever during the dengue epidemic without any other attributable cause for uveitis. The dengue fever had subsided without any complication. None of the patients had any ocular complication during the acute dengue infection. They were treated on the lines of uveitis with local steroids, cycloplegic, and ocular hypotensive medications, when required, and oral steroid in case of posterior segment involvement. Patients' follow-up varied from 3-5 months.
RESULTS: Six patients with serological evidence of prior dengue fever had presented with uveitis not attributable to any other disease. Seven eyes of six patients were affected. Anterior uveitis without any evidence of posterior segment involvement was present in six eyes of five patients whereas one patient had severe vitritis also. The most common symptom was progressive decrease in vision and only three out of seven eyes had evidence of ciliary congestion. All patients promptly responded to the treatment and visual acuity returned to 6/9 or better in five eyes, while 6/24 and 6/18 in other two eyes due to the presence of cataract.

Cystoid macular edema (CME) is a leading cause of blindness. This study assessed the efficacy and safety of tocilizumab (TCZ) in refractory CME.
DESIGN: Retrospective case series.
METHODS: Patients with CME secondary to noninfectious uveitis who had inadequate response to corticosteroids and at least 1 conventional immunosuppressive drug, and in most cases to other biological agents, were studied. CME was defined as central retinal thickness greater than 300 μm. The primary outcome measure was macular thickness. Intraocular inflammation, best-corrected visual acuity (BCVA), and corticosteroid-sparing effect were also analyzed.
RESULTS: A total of 25 patients (mean ± standard deviation age 33.6 ± 18.9 years; 17 women) with CME were assessed. Underlying diseases associated with uveitis-related CME are juvenile idiopathic arthritis (n = 9), Behçet disease (n = 7), birdshot retinochoroidopathy (n = 4), idiopathic (n = 4), and sarcoidosis (n = 1). The ocular patterns were panuveitis (n = 9), anterior uveitis (n = 7), posterior uveitis (n = 5), and intermediate uveitis (n = 4). Most patients had CME in both eyes (n = 24). TCZ was used in monotherapy (n = 11) or combined with conventional immunosuppressive drugs. Regardless of the underlying disease, compared to baseline, a statistically significant improvement in macular thickness (415.7 ± 177.2 vs 259.1 ± 499.5 μm; P = .00009) and BCVA (0.39 ± 0.31 vs 0.54 ± 0.33; P = .0002) was obtained, allowing us to reduce the daily dose of prednisone (15.9 ± 13.6 mg/day vs 3.1 ± 2.3 mg/day; P = .002) after 12 months of therapy. Remission was achieved in 14 patients. Only minor side effects were observed after a mean follow-up of 12.7 ± 8.34 months.
CONCLUSION: Macular thickness is reduced following administration of TCZ in refractory uveitis-related CME.",28,2019-Apr-1

Rats immunized with microgram amounts of interphotoreceptor retinoid-binding protein (IRBP), a glycoprotein which localizes specifically in the eye and pineal gland, developed uveoretinitis and pinealitis. The severity and onset of changes were found to be dose-related and to be enhanced by B. pertussis bacteria. In general, the inflammatory changes induced by IRBP resembled those provoked by S-antigen (S-Ag), but significant differences were noted between the two diseases.

Risk factors for significant visual loss were investigated in 51 patients with iridocyclitis associated with juvenile rheumatoid arthritis (JRA). Average follow-up was 12.7 years. Of 89 eyes with uveitis, 22% had visual loss to 20/200 or worse, 46% had cataracts, 30% had band keratopathy, and 27% had glaucoma. Severity of visual loss and complications correlated with the degree of inflammation found on initial ocular examination. Of 58 eyes that were initially normal or had signs of mild inflammation (cells, flare, keratitic precipitates), 3% had final vision of 20/200 or worse, 28% had cataracts, 5% had band keratopathy, and 17% had glaucoma. Of 31 eyes with posterior synechiae on initial examination, 58% had final vision of 20/200 or worse, 81% had cataracts, 77% had band keratopathy, and 45% had glaucoma. When arthritis clearly preceded uveitis, 6% of patients had a poor visual outcome compared to 67% of patients whose initial manifestation of JRA was uveitis. Systemic corticosteroid administration used primarily for arthritis correlated with cataract formation.",28,1987-Oct-1

Worldwide, ocular toxoplasmosis (OT) is the principal cause of posterior uveitis, a severe, life-altering disease. A Toxoplasma gondii enzyme-linked immunoassay that detects strain-specific antibodies present in serum was used to correlate serotype with disease.
METHODS: Toxoplasma serotypes in consecutive serum samples from German uveitis patients with OT were compared with non-OT seropositive patients with noninfectious autoimmune posterior uveitis. OT patients were tested for association of parasite serotype with age, gender, location, clinical onset, size, visual acuity, or number of lesions (mean follow-up, 3.8 years) to determine association with recurrences.
RESULTS: A novel, nonreactive (NR) serotype was detected more frequently in serum samples of OT patients (50/114, 44%) than in non-OT patients (4/56, 7%) (odds ratio, 10.0; 95% confidence interval 3.4-40.8; P < .0001). Non-OT patients were predominantly infected with Type II strains (39/56; 70%), consistent with expected frequencies in Central Europe. Among OT patients, those with NR serotypes experienced more frequent recurrences (P = .037). Polymerase chain reaction detected parasite DNA in 8/60 OT aqueous humor specimens but failed to identify Type II strain alleles.
CONCLUSIONS: Toxoplasma NR and Type II serotypes predominate in German OT patients. The NR serotype is associated with OT recurrences, underscoring the value of screening for management of disease.",28,2013-Nov-01

Blau syndrome (BS) and early onset sarcoidosis (EOS) are, respectively, the familial and sporadic forms of the pediatric granulomatous autoinflammatory disease, which belong to the group of monogenic autoinflammatory syndromes. Both of these conditions are caused by mutations in the NOD2 gene, which encodes the cytosolic NOD2 protein, one of the pivotal molecules in the regulation of innate immunity, primarily expressed in the antigen-presenting cells. Clinical onset of BS and EOS is usually in the first years of life with noncaseating epithelioid granulomas mainly affecting joints, skin, and uveal tract, variably associated with heterogeneous systemic features. The dividing line between autoinflammatory and autoimmune mechanisms is probably not so clear-cut, and the relationship existing between BS or EOS and autoimmune phenomena remains unclear. There is no established therapy for the management of BS and EOS, and the main treatment aim is to prevent ocular manifestations entailing the risk of potential blindness and to avoid joint deformities. Nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs, corticosteroids and immunosuppressive drugs, such as methotrexate or azathioprine, may be helpful; when patients are unresponsive to the combination of corticosteroids and immunosuppressant agents, the tumor necrosis factor-α inhibitor infliximab should be considered. Data on anti-interleukin-1 inhibition with anakinra and canakinumab is still limited and further corroboration is required. The aim of this paper is to describe BS and EOS, focusing on their genetic, clinical, and therapeutic issues, with the ultimate goal of increasing clinicians' awareness of both of these rare but serious disorders.",28,2014-Dec-1

The determination of the molecular mechanism underlying retinal pathogenesis and visual dysfunction during innate inflammation, and the treatment effect of rapamycin thereon.
METHODS: The endotoxin-induced uveitis and retinitis mouse model was established by injecting lipopolysaccharide. The mice were subsequently treated with rapamycin, a mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) inhibitor. The rhodopsin mRNA and protein expression level in the retina and the photoreceptor outer segment (OS) length in immunohistochemical stainings were measured, and visual function was recorded by electroretinography. Inflammatory cytokines, their related molecules, mTOR, and LC3 levels were measured by real-time PCR and/or immunoblotting. Leukocyte adhesion during inflammation was analyzed using concanavalin A lectin.
RESULTS: The post-transcriptional reduction in the visual pigment of rod photoreceptor cells, rhodopsin, OS shortening, and rod photoreceptor cell dysfunction during inflammation were suppressed by rapamycin. Activation of nuclear factor kappa-light-chain-enhancer of activated B cells (NF-κB) and induction of inflammatory cytokines, such as interleukin-6 (IL-6) and monocyte chemoattractant protein-1 (MCP-1), and the activation of the downstream signaling protein, signal transducer and activator of transcription 3 (STAT3), which reduces rhodopsin in the retina during inflammation, were attenuated by rapamycin. Increased leukocyte adhesion was also attenuated by rapamycin. Interestingly, although mTOR activation was observed after NF-κB activation, mTOR inhibition suppressed NF-κB activation at the early phase, indicating that the basal level of activated mTOR was sufficient to activate NF-κB in the retina. In addition, the inhibition of NF-κB suppressed mTOR activation, suggesting a positive feedback loop of mTOR and NF-κB during inflammation. The ratio of LC3II to LC3I, which reflects autophagy induction, was not changed by inflammation but was increased by rapamycin.
CONCLUSIONS: Our results propose the potential use of rapamycin as a neuroprotective therapy to suppress local activated mTOR levels, related inflammatory molecules, and the subsequent visual dysfunction during retinal inflammation.",28,2016-1-1

Over the past several decades, animal models of autoimmune uveitis directed at eye-specific antigens (Ags) have been developed. These have allowed researchers to understand the basic mechanisms that lead to these diseases and also recently helped the researchers in translational research for therapeutic interventions. Experimental autoimmune uveitis (EAU) is an animal disease model of human endogenous uveitis and can be induced in susceptible animals by immunization with retinal Ags. Ever since the first description of EAU in mice in 1988, several animal models of uveitis has been described by researchers. Disease-specific model for cytomegalovirus retinitis and tubercular uveitis has evolved our understanding of these complex entities. Endotoxin induced uveitis is another useful model for anterior uveitis, which is not an autoimmune process and is triggered by injection of bacterial endotoxin (lipopolysaccharides) resulting in a rapid short lasting uveitis. The current article will give an insight into the various EAU animal models and their current implications in translational research. The article will also highlight the different grading systems for EAU in the animal model.",28,2015-Mar-1

Noninfectious uveitis is a predominantly T cell-mediated autoimmune, intraocular inflammatory disease. To characterize the gene expression profile from patients with noninfectious uveitis, PBMCs were isolated from 50 patients with clinically characterized noninfectious uveitis syndrome. A pathway-specific cDNA microarray was used for gene expression profiling and real-time PCR array for further confirmation. Sixty-seven inflammation- and autoimmune-associated genes were found differentially expressed in uveitis patients, with 28 of those genes being validated by real-time PCR. Several genes previously unknown for autoimmune uveitis, including IL-22, IL-19, IL-20, and IL-25/IL-17E, were found to be highly expressed among uveitis patients compared with the normal subjects with IL-22 expression highly variable among the patients. Furthermore, we show that IL-22 can affect primary human retinal pigment epithelial cells by decreasing total tissue resistance and inducing apoptosis possibly by decreasing phospho-Bad level. In addition, the microarray data identified a possible uveitis-associated gene expression pattern, showed distinct gene expression profiles in patients during periods of clinical activity and quiescence, and demonstrated similar expression patterns in related patients with similar clinical phenotypes. Our data provide the first evidence that a subset of IL-10 family genes are implicated in noninfectious uveitis and that IL-22 can affect human retinal pigment epithelial cells. The results may facilitate further understanding of the molecular mechanisms of autoimmune uveitis and other autoimmune originated inflammatory diseases.",28,2008-Oct-01

To investigate the clinical features of secondary glaucoma associated with uveitis.
METHODS: The subjects of the study were 1,099 patients with uveitis (1,604 eyes) treated at the Miyata Eye Hospital, Miyakonojo, Miyazaki, between October 1974 and January 2000. The intraocular pressure (IOP) and clinical data were analyzed retrospectively. Secondary glaucoma was diagnosed in the patients when IOP was higher than 21 mm Hg at two consecutive visits and they needed treatment with medication to control the high IOP.
RESULTS: Secondary glaucoma was found in 293 eyes (18.3%) of 217 patients (19.7%) among the uveitis patients. The clinical entity with the highest incidence of secondary glaucoma was Posner-Schlossman syndrome in 100%, followed by sarcoidosis in 34.1%, herpetic anterior uveitis in 30.4%, Behçet's disease in 20.8%, human leukocyte antigen-B27-related acute anterior uveitis in 20.0%, Vogt-Koyanagi-Harada's disease in 16.4%, and human T-lymphotropic virus type 1 uveitis in 16.2%. Among these 293 eyes with secondary glaucoma, the majority (72%) had active anterior uveitis at the time of high IOP. Only 7.5% of the secondary glaucoma eyes had peripheral anterior synechia wider than 180 degrees of the trabecular meshwork. Steroid-induced glaucoma was found in only 8.9% of the secondary glaucoma eyes. Surgical therapy, mainly trabeculectomy with anti-metabolites, was performed in 38 eyes and the post-surgical IOP was controlled under 20 mm Hg in 34 eyes. Despite the medical and surgical therapy for secondary glaucoma, visual field defect was found in 39% of the secondary glaucoma eyes.
CONCLUSIONS: The incidence of secondary glaucoma in the 1,604 eyes with uveitis was 18.3%, but it differed depending upon the clinical entity of the uveitis. The evaluation and the management of IOP are very important in the treatment of patients with uveitis, in addition to the management of intraocular inflammation.",28,2002-1-1

This work investigates the incidence and clinical features of syphilitic uveitis in patients infected with human immunodeficiency virus (HIV).
MATERIAL AND METHODS: We retrospectively reviewed syphilitic uveitis in patients coinfected with HIV that presented at a referral center between July 2001 and November 2003.
RESULTS: Twelve patients (20 eyes) were included. The ocular manifestations of syphilis led to the discovery of HIV-1 seropositivity in three patients. All patients were male and homosexual. One patient has been previously treated for syphilis with benzathine penicillin G. One patient presented with anterior uveitis and 11 patients had panuveitis or posterior uveitis. Necrotizing retinitis was noted in seven eyes (35%), posterior placoid chorioretinitis in six eyes (30%) and optic nerve involvement in five eyes (25%). Of nine patients with available cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) studies, seven (77.8%) had CSF abnormalities. Eleven patients were treated with intravenous penicillin G and one with intravenous ceftriaxone sodium. One patient required a second course of antibiotics to control uveitis. Ocular inflammation decreased and visual acuity improved in all nine patients for whom follow-up was available after treatment.
CONCLUSION: Manifestations of syphilitic uveitis in HIV-infected patients are multiple, with high frequencies of posterior uveitis, posterior placoid chorioretinitis, necrotizing retinitis and optic nerve involvement. Syphilitic uveitis in HIV-infected patients seems to have a more severe course and may relapse despite high-dose intravenous penicillin therapy.",28,2005-Sep-1

Tubulointerstitial nephritis and uveitis (TINU) syndrome is characterized by tubulointerstitial and ocular inflammation. Thus far, the value of noninvasive diagnostic tests is not known.
OBJECTIVE: To determine whether urinary β2-microglobulin (β2M), urinary protein, and serum creatinine have predictive value for detecting TINU syndrome in young patients with uveitis.
DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: This prospective cohort study was conducted July 2010 through February 2013 at a tertiary care referral center in Utrecht, the Netherlands. Forty-five consecutive new patients with uveitis aged 22 years or younger were enrolled.
EXPOSURES: Urinary β2M, urinary protein, and serum creatinine were measured prospectively, and the estimated glomerular filtration rate was calculated.
MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: A post hoc analysis was performed to determine whether urinary β2M, urinary protein, serum creatinine, estimated glomerular filtration rate, and/or pyuria were correlated with definitive and probable cases of TINU syndrome.
RESULTS: Eighteen of the 45 patients (40%) in our cohort had elevated urinary β2M levels, and 10 patients (22%) had elevated serum creatinine levels. Twenty of 43 patients (47%) had proteinuria. Eight of the 45 patients were diagnosed by a pediatric nephrologist as having renal dysfunction that suggested acute interstitial nephritis. Of these 8 patients, 2 were definitively diagnosed as having TINU syndrome (confirmed by renal biopsy). After excluding other causes of renal dysfunction, the remaining 6 patients with uveitis and renal dysfunction fulfilled the criteria of probable TINU syndrome. The 8 patients with definitive or probable TINU syndrome had higher urinary β2M levels than patients with normal renal function (median β2M, 1.95 mg/L; 95% CI, 1.26-5.16 mg/L vs 0.20 mg/L; 95% CI, 0.19-0.21 mg/L; P < .001; Mann-Whitney U test). Our analysis revealed that the positive predictive value of increased β2M combined with increased serum creatinine was 100% for detecting definitive and/or probable TINU syndrome.
CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: These data suggest that urinary β2M and serum creatinine levels are sensitive and relatively simple diagnostic screening tools for detecting renal dysfunction to diagnose TINU syndrome in young patients with uveitis similar to those evaluated in this study.",28,2015-Feb-1

To evaluate the efficacy and safety of intravitreal sirolimus in the treatment of noninfectious uveitis (NIU) of the posterior segment (i.e., posterior, intermediate, or panuveitis).
DESIGN: Phase III, randomized, double-masked, active-controlled, 6-month study with intravitreal sirolimus.
PARTICIPANTS: Adults with active NIU of the posterior segment (intermediate, posterior, or panuveitis), defined as a vitreous haze (VH) score >1+. Subjects discontinued NIU medications before baseline, except for systemic corticosteroids, which were allowed only for those already receiving them at baseline and were rapidly tapered after baseline per protocol.
METHODS: Intravitreal sirolimus assigned 1:1:1 at doses of 44 (active control), 440, or 880 μg, administered on Days 1, 60, and 120.
MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: The primary efficacy outcome was the percentage of subjects with VH 0 response at Month 5 (study eye) without use of rescue therapy. Secondary outcomes at Month 5 were VH 0 or 0.5+ response rate, corticosteroid tapering success rate (i.e., tapering to a prednisone-equivalent dosage of ≤5 mg/day), and changes in best-corrected visual acuity (BCVA). Adverse events during the double-masked treatment period are presented.
RESULTS: A total of 347 subjects were randomized. Higher proportions of subjects in the intravitreal sirolimus 440 μg (22.8%; P = 0.025) and 880 μg (16.4%; P = 0.182) groups met the primary end point than in the 44 μg group (10.3%). Likewise, higher proportions of subjects in the 440 μg (52.6%; P = 0.008) and 880 μg (43.1%; P = 0.228) groups achieved a VH score of 0 or 0.5+ than in the 44 μg group (35.0%). Mean BCVA was maintained throughout the study in each dose group, and the majority of subjects receiving corticosteroids at baseline successfully tapered off corticosteroids (44 μg [63.6%], 440 μg [76.9%], and 880 μg [66.7%]). Adverse events in the treatment and active control groups were similar in incidence, and all doses were well tolerated.
CONCLUSIONS: Intravitreal sirolimus 440 μg demonstrated a significant improvement in ocular inflammation with preservation of BCVA in subjects with active NIU of the posterior segment.",28,2016-Nov-1

To describe the effect of additional treatment with anti-TNF-alpha therapy in a case series of 13 patients with serious sight threatening uveitis.
METHODS: 13 patients with serious sight threatening uveitis were included, of whom six had Behçet's disease, five had idiopathic posterior uveitis, one had sarcoidosis, and one birdshot retinochoroiditis. Onset and course of ocular inflammation, inflammatory signs, and visual acuity were assessed. Patients were treated with 200 mg (approximately 3 mg/kg) infliximab infusion. Repeat infusions were given based on clinical response.
RESULTS: Infliximab treatment resulted in an effective suppression of ocular inflammation in all patients. In patients with non-Behcet's disease uveitis visual acuity in six out of eight improved or was stable. In patients with Behcet's disease visual acuity in five out of six improved or was stable.
CONCLUSION: Anti-TNF-alpha treatment may be of value in the treatment of uveitis, and in patients with Behçet's disease, leading to suppression of ocular inflammation, vasculitis, and improvement of vision in the majority. Based on these results a controlled masked study is warranted.",28,2005-May-1

Bartonella spp antibodies were measured in the serum and aqueous humour of cats with and without uveitis and polymerase chain reaction (PCR) for Bartonella spp DNA was performed on aqueous humour from most of the cats. Serum and aqueous humour were assayed from 49 client-owned cats with uveitis, 49 healthy shelter cats, and nine cats experimentally inoculated with either B henselae or B clarridgeiae, 454 days after inoculation. An aqueous antibody coefficient (C value) was calculated for cats positive for Bartonella spp antibodies in the aqueous humour. Ocular production of Bartonella spp IgG (C value >1) was detected in seven of 49 cats with uveitis, none of 49 healthy shelter cats, and four of nine experimentally inoculated cats. The organism was detected by PCR in the aqueous humour of three of 24 cats with uveitis, one of 49 healthy shelter cats, and four of nine experimentally inoculated cats. Bartonella spp infect the eyes of some cats following natural exposure or experimental inoculation and may cause uveitis in some cats.",28,2000-Mar-1

To assess the effectiveness of anti-tuberculous treatment in patients with chronic uveitis and either active systemic or latent tuberculosis (TB) in a non-endemic community.
METHODS: Retrospective study of patients with chronic uveitis, non-ocular evidence of latent or active TB and no other identified cause of uveitis who underwent a 6-month course of standard anti-tuberculous chemotherapy. Response to treatment was assessed at 6 and 12 months after initiation of treatment.
RESULTS: A total of 27 patients were included of whom 59% were female. In all, 19 were Asian, 4 Caucasian, and 4 Black. More than half of patients had a history of contact with another person treated for TB. Inflammation resolved after chemotherapy in 70.3% of patients, 18.5% had a change in the nature of their inflammation and 11.1% had no benefit.
CONCLUSIONS: There were no uveitis features characteristic of TB uveitis and a wide range of manifestations was seen ranging from non-granulomatous anterior uveitis to occlusive retinal vasculitis. TB is not endemic in the United Kingdom, therefore consideration of ethnicity, immigration, and history of TB contact remain important to direct investigations. In a patient with uveitis and latent TB, a full 6-month course of anti-tuberculous chemotherapy is recommended although it may not be curative of the uveitis.",28,2011-Apr-1

To assess the outcomes of the intravitreal administration of methotrexate in uveitis.
METHODS: Multicenter, retrospective interventional case series of patients with noninfectious uveitis. Thirty-eight eyes of 30 patients were enrolled, including a total of 54 intravitreal injections of methotrexate at a dose of 400 µg in 0.1 mL. The primary outcome measure was visual acuity. Secondary outcome measures included control of intraocular inflammation and cystoid macular edema, time to relapse, development of adverse events, and levels of systemic corticosteroid and immunosuppressive therapy.
RESULTS: Methotrexate proved effective in controlling intraocular inflammation and improving vision in 30 of 38 eyes (79%). The side effect profile was good, with no reported serious ocular adverse events and only one patient having an intraocular pressure of >21 mmHg. Of the 30 eyes that responded to treatment, 8 relapsed, but 22 (73%) entered an extended period of remission, with the Kaplan-Meier estimate of median time to relapse for the whole group being 17 months. The eight eyes that relapsed were reinjected and all responded to treatment. One eye relapsed at 3 months, but 7 eyes again entered extended remission. Of the 14 patients on systemic therapy at the start of the study, 8 (57%) were able to significantly reduce this following intravitreal methotrexate injection.
CONCLUSION: In patients with uveitis and uveitic cystoid macular edema, intravitreal MTX can effectively improve visual acuity and reduce cystoid macular edema and, in some patients, allows the reduction of immunosuppressive therapy. Some patients relapse at 3 to 4 months, but a large proportion (73%) enter an extended period of remission of up to 18 months. This larger study extends the results obtained from previous smaller studies suggesting the viability of intravitreal methotrexate as a treatment option in uveitis.",27,2013-1-1

Although uveitis is relatively uncommon in children, its diagnosis and management present a distinct clinical challenge for the physician. An improved knowledge of disease patterns and associated morbidity will help in the care of children with uveitis.
METHODS: The authors reviewed the records of 130 patients with onset of uveitis at 16 years of age or younger. The etiology of uveitis, complications encountered, treatment administered, and visual results were analyzed.
RESULTS: Uveitis associated with juvenile rheumatoid arthritis (JRA) was the largest group (41.5%) followed by idiopathic uveitis (21.5%) and pars planitis (15.3%). Twenty-six percent of the eyes had less than 20/200 visual acuity at the time of first referral. Patients with JRA had the highest rate of complications: cataract (71%), glaucoma (30%), band keratopathy (66%), and hypotony (19%). The most frequent complication of pars planitis was maculopathy (55%). Final visual acuity was less than 20/200 in 26% of eyes with JRA, 10.5% with pars planitis, and 14% with idiopathic uveitis.
CONCLUSION: Uveitis beginning in childhood is a serious disease associated with sight-threatening complications. Juvenile rheumatoid arthritis-associated uveitis remains a leading cause of ocular morbidity in patients with childhood uveitis. Increased awareness by pediatricians, rheumatologists, and ophthalmologists of the seriousness of ocular complications of uveitis in childhood may lead to earlier diagnosis and more effective treatment regimens in the future.",27,1996-Mar-1

To evaluate the risk, risk factors, and visual impact of choroidal neovascularization (CNV) in uveitis cases.
DESIGN: Retrospective cohort study.
METHODS: Standardized medical record review at 5 tertiary centers.
RESULTS: Among 15,137 uveitic eyes (8868 patients), CNV was rare in the cases of anterior or intermediate uveitis. Among the 4041 eyes (2307 patients) with posterior uveitis or panuveitis, 81 (2.0%) had CNV at presentation. Risk factors included posterior uveitis in general and specific uveitis syndromes affecting the outer retina-retinal pigment epithelium-choroid interface. Among the 2364 eyes (1357 patients) with posterior uveitis or panuveitis and free of CNV at the time of cohort entry, the cumulative 2-year incidence of CNV was 2.7% (95% confidence interval [CI], 1.8% to 3.5%). Risk factors for incident CNV included currently active inflammation (adjusted hazard ratio [aHR], 2.13; 95% CI, 1.26 to 3.60), preretinal neovascularization (aHR, 3.19; 95% CI, 1.30 to 7.80), and prior diagnosis of CNV in the contralateral eye (aHR, 5.79; 95% CI, 2.77 to 12.09). Among specific syndromes, the incidence was greater in Vogt-Koyanagi-Harada syndrome (aHR, 3.37; 95% CI, 1.52 to 7.46) and punctate inner choroiditis (aHR, 8.67; 95% CI, 2.83 to 26.54). Incident CNV was associated with a 2-line loss of visual acuity (+0.19 logarithm of the minimal angle of resolution units; 95% CI, 0.079 to 0.29) from the preceding visit.
CONCLUSIONS: CNV is an uncommon complication of uveitis associated with visual impairment that occurs more commonly in forms affecting the outer retina-retinal pigment epithelium-choroid interface, during periods of inflammatory activity, in association with preretinal neovascularization, and in second eyes of patients with unilateral CNV. Because CNV is treatable, a systematic approach to early detection in high-risk patients may be appropriate.",27,2013-Sep-1

To evaluate the long-term efficacy of golimumab in patients with severe recalcitrant uveitis who had inadequate response to previous biologics.
METHODS: Retrospective study (13 patients with JIA, 4 with HLA-B27-associated uveitis). Indication for treatment was active uveitis despite biologics. Golimumab dosing was 50 mg monthly/subcutaneously.
MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: uveitis activity, visual acuity improvement, reduction of systemic therapy (corticosteroids/immunosuppressants), adverse events.
RESULTS: Of 17 patients (34 affected eyes), response to golimumab was seen in 14 patients; at last visit uveitis was inactive in 12 patients. Three patients were nonresponders. Mean follow-up time on golimumab was 21.9 months. Visual acuity remained stable in 26 eyes, improved in 7, and worsened in 1. Mean systemic prednisolone dose before and after golimumab was 12.5-3.5 mg/day. One patient developed pulmonary infection.
CONCLUSIONS: Golimumab may be a promising new therapeutic option for severe uveitis patients who have not responded to other biologics.",27,2014-Apr-1

Uveitis is a sight-threatening disease. Up to 35% of patients may have impaired vision. Inflammation of the uvea tissue has more than 60 etiologies. Previous reports have shown that 20-40% of uveitis cases were noninfectious. Some of them may be associated with systemic rheumatological and autoimmune diseases but some may affect the eyes only. The epidemiology and clinical situations of some specific uveitis entities vary worldwide because they are influenced by genetic, ethnic, environmental, and socioeconomic factors. The Asia-Pacific region comprises more than 30 countries. Epidemiology and patterns of uveitis vary greatly in this region. However, some uveitis entities, such as Behcet's disease, sarcoidosis, and Vogt-Koyanagi-Harada disease, are more common in this region. Many studies on the epidemiology, risk factors, and immune pathogenesis of this disease have been conducted. In this article, we review the epidemiology of noninfectious uveitis and special situations of these three uveitis entities in the Asia-Pacific region.",27,2019-Jan-1

Experimental autoimmune uveoretinitis was induced in rats after one injection of purified retinal S antigen mixed with adjuvants. Lewis and PVG/c rat strains were highly sensitive. S antigens isolated from bovine, human, swine and guinea pig retinas had a high pathogenicity in Lewis rats, whereas allogenic S antigen did not induce the disease. Mycobacterial adjuvant was effect in both disease and antibody production but H. pertussis adjuvant strongly increased the severity of the ocular reaction, giving a hyperacute Arthus-type inflammation, even with low doses of antigen. No disease was found after immunization without bacteria (incomplete Freund's adjuvant or alum). With any bacterial adjuvant, the histological pattern was in agreement with the hypothesis of early reagin-mediated phenomena acting on the blood-retinal barrier, as suggested by previous experiments.",27,1981-1-1

The uveitides are a heterogeneous group of diseases characterized by inflammation inside the eye. The uveitides are classified as infectious or non-infectious. The non-infectious uveitides, which are presumed to be immune mediated, can be further divided into those that are associated with a known systemic disease and those that are eye limited,-ie, not associated with a systemic disease. The ophthalmologist identifies the specific uveitic entity by medical history, clinical examination, and ocular imaging, as well as supplemental laboratory testing, if indicated. Treatment of the infectious uveitides is tailored to the particular infectious organism and may include regional and/or systemic medication. First line treatment for non-infectious uveitides is corticosteroids that can be administered topically, as regional injections or surgical implants, or systemically. Systemic immunosuppressive therapy is used in patients with severe disease who cannot tolerate corticosteroids, require chronic corticosteroids at >7.5 mg/day prednisone, or in whom the disease is known to respond better to immunosuppression. Management of many of these diseases is optimized by coordination between the ophthalmologist and rheumatologist or internist.",27,2021-Feb-03

Authors: Rao, N A
Publication Date: 1990-1-1
PMID: 1965620
It is known that the visual loss in severe uveitis is due primarily to retinal tissue damage. In order to test the hypothesis that this damage may result from oxygen free radical-induced peroxidation of retinal membrane lipids, the generation of oxygen metabolites at the site of intraocular inflammation was investigated in an animal model of uveitis induced by retinal S-antigen. The effect of these metabolites on the initiation of retinal damage was characterized by histochemical, biochemical, morphologic, and morphometric methods. Light and electron microscopic studies at the early stage of the inflammation disclosed disorganization, degeneration, and necrosis of the photoreceptors and other retinal cells. Novel histochemical procedures demonstrated formation of superoxide and hydrogen peroxide at the site of uveoretinitis. Chemiluminescence measurements on uveoretinal tissue from these experimental animals revealed generation of superoxide anion and hydroxyl radicals. During the early phase of the uveoretinitis, concomitant with generation of the oxygen metabolites, there was peroxidation of retinal membrane lipids. The peroxidation products consisted of CD, MDA, hydroperoxides, and others. Associated with these changes was a selective depletion of the PUFA 22:6, decrease of which in the retinal composition has been shown to affect visual function. The morphologic and biochemical investigations clearly indicate that oxygen free radicals are generated at the site of uveoretinitis and that the retinal damage is mediated by peroxidation of lipids that are present in the retinal cell membranes. It would thus seem logical that such intraocular inflammation and the resultant retinal damage could be suppressed by antioxidant enzymes and oxygen free radical scavengers. These studies provide for the first time clear indication for developing new therapeutic agents that possess oxygen free radical scavenging properties, for treatment of human uveitis.",27,1990-1-1

The data of 750 consecutive uveitis patients who visited the uveitis department of the Rotterdam Eye Hospital were analysed by computer. Anterior uveitis was diagnosed most frequently (52%), mostly the acute form. We found a high percentage of Fuchs' heterochromic iridocyclitis and HLA-B27+ iridocyclitis. In the posterior uveitis group appeared the more recent clinical entities such as acute retinal necrosis, Birdshot retinochoroidopathy, CMV-retinitis, AMPPE and ocular candidiasis. Ocular Toxoplasmosis was still the leading cause in this group. These data will be compared with other studies of similar populations. Factors influencing frequency of subtypes of uveitis and bias of this study will be discussed.",27,1993-Apr-1

A retrospective chart review was conducted to detect patients with sarcoidosis seen by pediatric rheumatology service from the period of 1992 to 2013 at Children's hospital of New Orleans. Twenty-seven patients were identified. The average duration of symptoms before diagnosis was 5 (range 1-120) months. Five patients had onset before the age of 5 years and were diagnosed with early-onset sarcoidosis. The most common manifestations at presentation were constitutional symptoms (62 %) followed by ocular (38 %). During the course of illness, 19/27 (70 %) had multiorgan involvement. Common manifestations included uveitis/iritis (77 %), fever (50 %), hilar adenopathy (42 %), arthritis (31 %), peripheral lympadenopathy (31 %), hepatosplenomegaly (31 %), parenchymal lung disease (27 %), and skin rash (19 %). Unusual manifestations included granulomatous bone marrow disease (3 cases), hypertension (2), abdominal aortic aneurysm (large vessel vasculitis; 1), granulomatous hepatitis (1), nephrocalcinosis (1), membranous nephropathy (1), refractory granulomatous interstitial nephritis with recurrence in transplanted kidney (1), CNS involvement (2), parotid gland enlargement (1), and sensorineural hearing loss (1). Biopsy specimen was obtained in 21/27 (77 %) patients, and demonstration of noncaseating granuloma associated with negative stains for mycobacteria and fungi was seen in 18 patients. Elevated angiotensin-converting enzyme level was seen in 74 % of patients. Treatment with oral prednisone was initiated in symptomatic patients with significant clinical improvement. Low-dose methotrexate (MTX) 10-15 mg/m(2)/week orally, as steroid-sparing agent, was administered in 14 patients. Other immunomodulators included cyclophosphamide (2 patients), etanercept (2), infliximab (2), mycophenolate mofetil (1), and tacrolimus (1). Childhood sarcoidosis is prevalent in Louisiana. Most of the affected children present with a multisystem disease associated with manifestations similar to those of adult patients. Low-dose MTX seems to be effective, steroid sparing, and safe adjunct to treat sarcoidosis with multiorgan involvement.

To study the impact of soluble IL2 receptor (sIL2R), chest x-ray (CxR), and angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) as markers for sarcoidosis in uveitis patients.
DESIGN: Retrospective study.
METHODS: Serum concentrations of sIL2R and ACE were measured in patients with active uveitis. Those with elevated sIL2R and /or ACE values were examined for suspected systemic sarcoidosis.
MAIN OUTCOME MEASURE: Our main outcome parameters were the specificity and sensitivity of sIL2R, CxR and ACE in screening for ocular sarcoidosis.
RESULTS: We measured 261 patients with uveitis for sarcoidosis using sIL2R and ACE between January 2008 and November 2011; sarcoidosis was been diagnosed using other tests (e.g. computer tomography, brochoalveolar lavage, biopsy) in 41 of 53 patients with elevated sIL2R values (>639 U/ml) and in one patient with normal sIL2R (582 U/ml). Their mean sIL2R value was 1310 U/ml, extending from 582 to 8659 U/ml. Only 9 patients, however, presented elevated ACE (>82 U/l). Their mean ACE value was 116.4 U/l, ranging from 84.1 to 175.5 U/l. IL2R specificity was 94% with 98% sensitivity. In contrast, ACE had a specificity of 99.5%, but a sensitivity of only 22%; the chest x-ray had a specificity of 100% with 50% sensitivity in detecting sarcoidosis. We observed the entire spectrum of uveitis: sixteen patients suffered from anterior, 8 from intermediate, 16 from posterior, and 2 from panuveitis.
CONCLUSIONS: An elevated level of soluble IL2R suggests sarcoidosis with uveitis more convincingly than ACE, making sIL2R a more effective marker parameter for sarcoidosis than ACE or chest x-ray in uveitis patients.",27,2016-1-1

A single amino acid mutation near the active site of the CAPN5 protease was linked to the inherited blinding disorder, autosomal dominant neovascular inflammatory vitreoretinopathy (ADNIV, OMIM #193235). In homology modeling with other calpains, this R243L CAPN5 mutation was situated in a mobile loop that gates substrate access to the calcium-regulated active site. In in vitro activity assays, the mutation increased calpain protease activity and made it far more active at low concentrations of calcium. To test whether the disease allele could yield an animal model of ADNIV, we created transgenic mice expressing human (h) CAPN5(R243L) only in the retina. The resulting hCAPN5(R243L) transgenic mice developed a phenotype consistent with human uveitis and ADNIV, at the clinical, histological and molecular levels. The fundus of hCAPN5(R243L) mice showed enhanced autofluorescence (AF) and pigment changes indicative of reactive retinal pigment epithelial cells and photoreceptor degeneration. Electroretinography showed mutant mouse eyes had a selective loss of the b-wave indicating an inner-retina signaling defect. Histological analysis of mutant mouse eyes showed protein extravasation from dilated vessels into the anterior chamber and vitreous, vitreous inflammation, vitreous and retinal fibrosis and retinal degeneration. Analysis of gene expression changes in the hCAPN5(R243L) mouse retina showed upregulation of several markers, including members of the Toll-like receptor pathway, chemokines and cytokines, indicative of both an innate and adaptive immune response.

Provide baseline and preliminary follow-up results in a 5-year longitudinal study of Blau syndrome.
DESIGN: Multicenter, prospective interventional case series.
METHODS: Baseline data from 50 patients from 25 centers worldwide, and follow-up data for patients followed 1, 2, or 3 years at the end of study enrollment. Ophthalmic data were collected at baseline and yearly visits by means of a standardized collection form.
RESULTS: Median age at onset of eye disease was 60 months and duration of eye disease at baseline 145 months. At baseline 38 patients (78%) had uveitis, which was bilateral in 37 (97%). Eight patients (21%) had moderate to severe visual impairment. Panuveitis was found in 38 eyes (51%), with characteristic multifocal choroidal infiltrates in 29 eyes (39%). Optic disc pallor in 9 eyes (12%) and peripapillary nodules in 9 eyes (12%) were the commonest signs of optic nerve involvement. Active anterior chamber inflammation was noted in 30 eyes (40%) at baseline and in 16 (34%), 17 (57%), and 11 (61%) eyes at 1, 2, and 3 years, respectively. Panuveitis was associated with longer disease duration. At baseline, 56 eyes (75%) were on topical corticosteroids. Twenty-six patients (68%) received a combination of systemic corticosteroids and immunomodulatory therapy.
CONCLUSIONS: Blau uveitis is characterized by progressive panuveitis with multifocal choroiditis, resulting in severe ocular morbidity despite continuous systemic and local immunomodulatory therapy. The frequency and severity of Blau uveitis highlight the need for close ophthalmologic surveillance as well as a search for more effective therapies.",27,2018-Mar-1

To determine 1) clinical predictors of an inflammatory syndrome associated with cytomegalovirus (CMV) retinitis (immune recovery vitritis or uveitis [IRV or IRU]); 2) clinical sequelae of IRV; and 3) the effect of corticosteroid treatment on visual acuity.
METHODS: A cohort study from the AIDS Ocular Research Unit of the University of California, San Diego, and a case series from the Cleveland Clinic consisted of patients who had acquired immunodeficiency syndrome and inactive CMV retinitis who responded to highly active antiretroviral therapy (HAART) with CD4 T-lymphocyte levels >60 cells/mm3. The cohort was followed for a median of 13.5 months following increase in CD4 count. The authors studied the occurrence of IRV, defined as symptomatic (vision decrease and/or floaters) vitritis of 1+ or greater severity associated with inactive CMV retinitis. Macular edema or epiretinal membrane formation was determined by clinical examination and fluorescein angiography. Five eyes were treated with sub-Tenon corticosteroid injections.
RESULTS: In the cohort study, 19 (63%) of 30 HAART responders developed IRV (26 eyes). The clinical spectrum of inflammation included vitritis, papillitis, macular edema, and epiretinal membranes. Eyes with CMV surface area >30% of the retina were at the highest risk (relative risk = 4.5) of developing IRV (P = 0.03). During follow-up, inflammation persisted without treatment for a median of 20 weeks and 14 patients (16 eyes) developed macular changes. Treatment resulted in vision improvement without reactivation of retinitis. Histology and immunohistochemistry of associated epiretinal membranes showed evidence of chronic inflammation with a predominant T-lymphocyte cell population. In the case series, 3 (38%) of 8 HAART responders developed IRV (4 eyes). All four eyes were treated and resulted in visual acuity improvement of one line.
CONCLUSIONS: Symptomatic IRV or IRU develops in a significant number of patients with CMV retinitis following successful HAART. Eyes with CMV surface area >30% of the retina are at the greatest risk. Eyes with IRV respond favorably to antiinflammatory therapy without reactivation of retinitis. Immune recovery vitritis may be the result of an immunologic reaction to latent CMV antigens in the eye in which T-lymphocytes play a role.",27,2001-1-1

The purpose of this study was to determine levels of IL-2, -4, -5, -10, TNF-alpha, and IFN-gamma in aqueous humor (AH) from patients with active panuveitis, anterior uveitis (AU), and noninflammatory controls by using a flow cytometric mutiplex array (CBA) and to compare with results from ELISA.
METHODS: Pooled normal AH was spiked with six cytokines at decreasing concentrations for evaluating the CBA. AH was also obtained from 10 controls (cataract patients) and 36 patients with active uveitis. Cell-free supernatants were added to a cocktail of capture beads and detector antibodies or to antibody-coated wells for CBA and ELISA determination, respectively.
RESULTS: CBA demonstrated greater sensitivity for detecting IL-4, IL-10, and TNF-alpha than with ELISA. Increased IFN-gamma was detected in both AU and panuveitis groups compared with controls (P < 0.01). IL-10 was higher in the panuveitis group on steroids (P < 0.01). IL-5 was detected in the control (P < 0.01) and AU groups (P < 0.05) but was undetectable in the panuveitis group (n = 10). Correlations between IFN-gamma and IL-10 were found in all uveitis groups (P < 0.01) but not in controls, whereas TNF-alpha correlations with IL-4/IFN-gamma were obtained in controls but not in the uveitis groups (P < 0.01).
CONCLUSIONS: It was possible to measure cytokines titrated into normal AH specimens by CBA, and a greater number of cytokines were detected with increased sensitivity than with ELISA. Elevated IFN-gamma in active uveitis and decreased IL-5 in posterior uveitis suggest Th1 polarity is more marked, with greater uveal tract involvement. The increased IL-10 in the steroid treated group suggests glucocorticoid-induced IL-10 upregulation.",27,2006-Jan-1

Pseudoexfoliation syndrome (PXF) was recently found to be associated with increased expression of transforming growth factor beta(1) (TGFbeta(1)) in the aqueous humour. As concern has been raised regarding anti-TGFbeta therapy, which can potentially disrupt the maintenance of anterior chamber associated immune deviation, the authors explored the levels of tissue inhibitor of matrix metalloproteinase-1 (TIMP-1), matrix metalloproteinase-9 (MMP-9), and connective tissue growth factor (CTGF) in aqueous humour to determine if these may represent alternative therapeutic targets.
METHODS: Aqueous humour samples were collected from patients who underwent routine cataract surgery. All patients were categorised into three main groups-PXF, uveitis, and control. The PXF group was further subcategorised into three grades based on the density of the exfoliative material observed on biomicroscopy, as well as the presence or absence of glaucoma. TIMP-1, MMP-9, and CTGF levels were measured using specific enzyme immunoassays (ELISA).
RESULTS: Eyes with PXF had significantly higher aqueous humour TIMP-1 concentration (n = 56, mean (SE), 9.76 (1.10) ng/ml) compared with controls (n = 112, 5.73 (0.43) ng/ml, p<0.01). Similarly, the CTGF level in PXF eyes (n = 36, 4.38 (0.65) ng/ml) was higher than controls (n = 29, 2.35 (0.46) ng/ml, p<0.05). Further, the CTGF concentration in the PXF glaucoma group is significantly higher compared with PXF eyes without glaucoma (6.03 (1.09) ng/ml v 2.73 (0.45) ng/ml, p<0.01). The MMP-9 levels were low and below detection limit in all PXF and control samples with no statistical difference between groups.
CONCLUSION: A raised TIMP-1 level and a low MMP-9 level in aqueous humour of PXF eyes may imply a downregulation in proteolytic activity. The increased CTGF concentration supports the proposed fibrotic pathology of PXF. Regulation of MMP/TIMP expression and anti-CTGF therapy may offer potential therapeutic avenues for controlling PXF associated ocular morbidity.",27,2005-Feb-1

In vertebrates, the innate and adaptive immune systems have evolved seamlessly to protect the host by rapidly responding to danger signals, eliminating pathogens and creating immunological memory as well as immunological tolerance to self. The innate immune system harnesses receptors that recognize conserved pathogen patterns and alongside the more specific recognition systems and memory of adaptive immunity, their interplay is evidenced by respective roles during generation and regulation of immune responses. The hallmark of adaptive immunity which requires engagement of innate immunity is an ability to discriminate between self and non-self (and eventually between pathogen and symbiont) as well as peripheral control mechanisms maintaining immunological health and appropriate responses. Loss of control mechanisms and/or regulation of either the adaptive or the innate immune system lead to autoimmunity and autoinflammation respectively. Although autoimmune pathways have been largely studied to date in the context of development of non-infectious intraocular inflammation, the recruitment and activation of innate immunity is required for full expression of the varied phenotypes of non-infectious uveitis. Since autoimmunity and autoinflammation implicate different molecular pathways, even though some convergence occurs, increasing our understanding of their respective roles in the development of uveitis will highlight treatment targets and influence our understanding of immune mechanisms operative in other retinal diseases. Herein, we extrapolate from the basic mechanisms of activation and control of innate and adaptive immunity to how autoinflammatory and autoimmune pathways contribute to disease development in non-infectious uveitis patients.",27,2012-Mar-1

A prior study showed that mice deficient in IFN-gamma (GKO) are more susceptible to experimental autoimmune uveitis (EAU) than are wild-type (WT) mice. Histopathology of uveitic eyes revealed that the ocular infiltrate in GKO mice was dominated by neutrophils and eosinophils rather than by mononuclear cells, as in WT mice. The present study was conducted to explore the differential expression of chemokine(s) likely to account for the distinct inflammatory cell composition in uveitic eyes of WT and GKO mice.
METHODS: Mice were immunized to induce EAU. Lymph nodes draining the site of the immunization and the eyes were collected at different time points for chemokine analysis. Microarray, real-time PCR and protein analyses were performed to examine the expression of chemokines in WT and GKO mice.
RESULTS: Many chemokines were differentially upregulated in GKO versus WT mice. Expression of the Th1-associated chemokines CXCL10, CXCL9, CCL5, and CXCL11 was elevated in WT mice, whereas the Th2-associated chemokines CCL11, CCL17, and CCL1 and the Th17-associated chemokines CCL22 and CXCL2 were elevated in the GKO mice. Depletion of granulocytes abrogated EAU in both WT and GKO mice.
CONCLUSIONS: These results suggest that Th1-associated chemokines play a critical role in the attraction of mononuclear cells to the eyes in the presence of IFN-gamma, while in the absence of this cytokine, Th2- and Th17-related chemokines may be the key elements for influx of granulocytes.",27,2007-Oct-1

The small heat shock protein, αA-crystallin null (αA-/-) mice are known to be more prone to retinal degeneration than the wild type mice in Experimental Autoimmune Uveoretinitis (EAU). In this report we demonstrate that intravenous administration of αA preserves retinal architecture and prevents photoreceptor damage in EAU. Interestingly, only αA and not αB-crystallin (αB), a closely related small heat shock protein works, pointing to molecular specificity in the observed retinal protection. The possible involvement of αA in retinal protection through immune modulation is corroborated by adaptive transfer experiments, (employing αA-/- and wild type mice with EAU as donors and Rag2-/- as the recipient mice), which indicate that αA protects against the autoimmune challenge by modulating the systemic B and T cell immunity. We show that αA administration causes marked reduction in Th1 cytokines (TNF-α, IL-12 and IFN-γ), both in the retina and in the spleen; notably, IL-17 was only reduced in the retina suggesting local intervention. Importantly, expression of Toll-like receptors and their associated adaptors is also inhibited suggesting that αA protection, against photoreceptor loss in EAU, is associated with systemic suppression of both the adaptive and innate immune responses.",27,2012-1-1

To assess the efficacy of golimumab (GLM) in refractory uveitis associated to spondyloarthritis (SpA).
METHODS: Multicenter study of SpA-related uveitis refractory to at least 1 immunosuppressive drug. The main outcome variables were degree of anterior and posterior chamber inflammation, visual acuity, and macular thickness.
RESULTS: A total of 15 patients (13 men/2 women; 18 affected eyes; mean age 39 ± 6 years) were evaluated. The underlying SpA subtypes were ankylosing spondylitis (n = 8), psoriatic arthritis (n = 6) and non-radiographic axial SpA (n = 1). The ocular involvement patterns were recurrent anterior uveitis in 8 patients and chronic anterior uveitis in 7. Before GLM they have received methotrexate (n = 13), sulfasalazine (n = 6), pulses of methylprednisolone (n = 4), azathioprine (n = 3), leflunomide (n = 2), and cyclosporine (n = 1). Overall, 10 of them had also been treated with TNF-α blockers; etanercept (n = 7), adalimumab (n = 7), infliximab (n = 6), and certolizumab (n = 1). GLM was given at the standard dose (50mg/sc/monthly) as monotherapy (n = 7) or in combination with conventional immunosuppressive drugs (n = 8), mainly methotrexate. Most patients had rapid and progressive improvement of intraocular inflammation parameters. The median number of cells in the anterior chamber at 2 years [0 (0-0)] was significantly reduced compared to baseline findings [1 (0-3); p = 0.04]. The mean best corrected visual acuity value also improved (0.84 ± 0.3 at 2 years versus 0.62 ± 0.3 at baseline; p = 0.03). Only minor side effects were observed after a mean follow-up of 23 ± 7 months.
CONCLUSIONS: Our results indicate that GLM may be a useful therapeutic option in refractory SpA-related uveitis.",27,2016-Aug-1

To identify factors associated with severe uveitis at diagnosis of eye disease in children with juvenile idiopathic arthritis (JIA) who were observed in a screening program, and to identify temporal changes in findings associated with screening during the period 1986 to 2000.
DESIGN: Case control study.
METHOD: Uveitis was defined as being severe at diagnosis if there were associated synechiae, cataracts, or retinal edema. Clinical factors for all patients undergoing screening for JIA-associated uveitis from 1986 to 2000 at one institution were studied retrospectively. Children with severe uveitis at diagnosis (cases) were compared with those with mild uveitis at diagnosis and those who never developed uveitis during follow-up in the screening program (controls).
RESULTS: Severe uveitis was present at diagnosis in 22 (5.4%) of 409 patients. Male patients were more likely to have severe uveitis at diagnosis (odds ratio [OR] 3.7 [95% confidence interval 1.3 to 10.7], P =.014). A longer interval from the onset of arthritis symptoms to the diagnosis of uveitis was associated with a reduced risk of severe uveitis at diagnosis (OR 0.95 [0.91 to 1.0], P =.044). There was no difference in the frequency of severe uveitis at diagnosis between two screening periods: 1986 to 1993 (before American screening guidelines were published) and 1994 to 2000.
CONCLUSIONS: Male children are more likely than female children to have severe uveitis at diagnosis. The proportion of children with severe uveitis at diagnosis has not changed since current screening guidelines have been widely publicized, suggesting the need for refinements in screening procedures to target high-risk children with increased surveillance.",27,2003-Jun-1

Behçet's disease (BD) is a helper T cell-mediated autoimmune disease characterised by recurrent orogenital ulcers, uveitis and skin lesions. The helper T cells are divided into Th1, Th2 and Th17 cells according to the pattern of cytokine secretion. Th1 and Th17 cells can contribute to the development of the disease with their respective proinflammatory cytokines, IFN-γ and IL-17. In this study, we investigated the relative role of Th17, Th1 and Th2 cells in BD.
METHODS: Peripheral blood mononuclear cells were isolated from 30 patients with BD, for whom the detailed clinical manifestations and medication history were investigated and recorded. Surface markers and intracellular levels of IL-17, IFN-γ and IL-4 in isolated CD4+ T cells were measured using flow-cytometry from these patients and from two control groups, 34 rheumatoid arthritis patients and 24 healthy blood donors to analyse the relationship of Th1, Th17 and Th2 cells in BD.
RESULTS: The ratio of Th17/Th1 cells was significantly increased in BD compared to healthy controls (0.16±0.09 vs. 0.10±0.04, p=0.012), while there was no difference in the ratios of Th1/Th2 or Th17/Th2 cells. Th17/Th1 ratio was elevated in BD patients with uveitis or folliculitis compared to those without it (0.21±0.10 vs. 0.13±0.06, p=0.045 for uveitis; 0.18±0.10 vs. 0.12±0.05, p=0.036 for folliculitis).
CONCLUSIONS: Our results confirm that TH17 cells are instrumental in Behçet's uveitis and folliculitis. Furthermore, our findings suggest that the role of Th17 cells should be interpreted in the context of their ratio to Th1 cells.",27,2010-1-1

This review provides a summary of our current understanding of the ophthalmic manifestations of Ebola virus disease (EVD), pathogenesis, treatment options and directions for future study. The individual, public health and global health implications of eye disease in EVD survivors are discussed.
RECENT FINDINGS: The West Africa EVD outbreak was of unprecedented magnitude, leading to the largest survivor cohort since the first documented EVD outbreak in 1976. Because of the magnitude of the recent outbreak, thousands of survivors are at-risk of systemic and ophthalmic sequelae termed the 'post Ebola virus disease syndrome'. Uveitis is the most common finding during EVD convalescence and may lead to severe vision impairment or blindness in 40% of affected individuals. Ocular complications leading to vision loss include cataract, retinal scarring, optic neuropathy, hypotony and phthisis bulbi. The pathogenesis of eye disease in EVD survivors likely involves Ebola virus persistence, severe inflammation and tissue edema, which present as acute, rapidly progressive disease or chronic, smoldering disease. Further studies into disease pathogenesis including mechanisms of viral persistence may provide guidance into therapies for uveitis secondary to EVD.
SUMMARY: Uveitis is the most common ophthalmic finding in EVD survivors and can lead to vision loss. Further studies into the clinical manifestations and mechanisms of disease are needed to improve therapies for EVD survivors who often have limited access to ophthalmic medical and surgical care.",26,2017-Nov-1

Uveitis describes a heterogeneous group of conditions characterized by intraocular inflammation. Since most of the sight-threatening forms of uveitis are individually rare, there has been an increasing tendency for clinical trials to group distinct uveitis syndromes together despite clear variations in phenotype which may reflect real aetiological and pathogenetic differences. Furthermore this grouping of distinct syndromes, and the range of manifestations within each uveitis syndrome, leads to a wide range of possible outcome measures. In this study we wished to review the degree of consensus or otherwise in the choice of primary outcome measures for registered clinical trials related to uveitis.
METHODS: Systematic review of data provided in clinical trial registries describing clinical trials dealing with medical treatment of intermediate, posterior, or panuveitis through 01 October 2013. We reviewed 15 on-line clinical trial registries approved by the International Committee of Medical Journal Editors. We identified all that met the following inclusion criteria: prospective, interventional design; target populations with intermediate, posterior or panuveitis; and one or more pre-specified outcome measures that were related to uveitis. Primary outcome measures were classified in terms of type (efficacy or safety or both; single, composite, or multiple); dimension (disease activity, disease damage, measured or patient-reported visual function); and domain (the specific study variable being measured).
RESULTS: Of 195 registered uveitis studies, we identified 104 clinical trials that met inclusion criteria. There were 14 different domains used as primary outcome measures. Among clinical trials that utilized primary outcome measures of treatment efficacy (n = 94), 70 (74 %) used a measure of disease activity (vitreous haze in 40/70 [57 %]; macular oedema in 19/70 [27 %]) and 49 (70 %) used a measure of visual function (visual acuity in all cases). Multiple primary outcome measures were used in 23 (22 %) of 104 clinical trials. With regard to quality, in 12 (12 %) of 104 clinical trials, outcome measures were poorly defined. No clinical trial utilized a patient-reported study variable as primary outcome measure.
CONCLUSIONS: This systematic review highlights the heterogeneity of outcome measures used in recent clinical trials for intermediate, posterior, and panuveitis. Current designs prioritize clinician-observed measures of disease activity and measurement of visual function as outcome measures. This apparent lack of consensus regarding outcome measures for the study of uveitis is a concern, as it prevents comparison of studies and meta-analyses, and weakens the evidence available to stake-holders, from patients to clinicians to regulators, regarding the efficacy and value of a given treatment.",26,2015-Aug-19

The posterior and intermediate uveitides share an underlying immune etiology; however, they can be clinically and immunopathologically distinguished. Although the initiating stimuli for posterior and intermediate uveities are not known, it is believed that an exogenous agent (such as a bacterium or a virus) or an endogenous molecule may induce disease. In either case, T-helper lymphocytes in conjunction with human leukocyte antigens are likely to be involved. This review examines the epidemiology, histology, immunopathology, and theories of pathogenesis of several posterior and intermediate uveitides, including sympathetic ophthalmia, Vogt-Koyanagi-Harada syndrome, Behçet's disease, sarcoidosis, intermediate uveitis, white dot syndromes, and birdshot retinochoroidopathy.",26,2001-1-1

In addition, various known disease target databases were enraolled, the therapeutic target proteins in uveitis were screened, and a protein-protein interaction (PPI) network was constructed. Enrichment analysis was performed on key nodes. Finally, the inhibitory effect of QHRGF on uveitis was verified by experiments.
RESULTS: We identified 259 major candidate targets of QHRGF and successfully constructed a 'QHRGF-compound-target-uveitis' network. Above-mentioned targets revealed by Gene enrichment analysis have played an significant role in the cell cycle, autoimmune disease, apoptosis and related signal pathways. We demonstrated that QHRGF attenuates local inflammation in experimental autoimmune uveoretinitis (EAU) rats by regulating natural killer T (NKT) cells and inhibiting MAPK signal pathways.
CONCLUSION: QHRGF may regulate the local immune response and inflammatory factors mainly through the MAPK signal pathway. For autoimmune uveitis, QHRGF may be a promising, long-lasting treatment strategy.",26,2019-Dec-1

We studied the case records of 1122 patients with endogenous uveitis including 418 new cases treated at the University Eye Clinic in Turku during the years 1980-1982 and 1988. The mean annual incidence and prevalence rates (per 100,000 population) of idiopathic acute anterior uveitis were 17.1 and 48.5, respectively, sarcoid anterior uveitis 0.5 and 1.5, Posner-Schlossman syndrome 0.4 and 1.9, herpes zoster uveitis 0.4 and 0.7, idiopathic chronic anterior uveitis 0.3 and 7.3, herpes simplex keratouveitis 0.3 and 0.5, juvenile rheumatoid arthritis 0.2 and 2.4, Fuchs' heterochromic iridocyclitis 0.2 and 0.5, intermediate uveitis 0.3 and 1.4, and of toxoplasmic retinochoroiditis 0.3 and 2.4. The incidence and prevalence rates of acute anterior uveitis associated with ankylosing spondylitis were 2.0 and 10.3 per 100,000 population, respectively, and this disease association occurred more often in men than in women (p < 0.001). The mean annual incidence of idiopathic acute anterior uveitis was significantly lower in the age group 0-19 years than in the other age groups (p < 0.001).",26,1997-Feb-1

To evaluate the efficacy and safety of Baerveldt glaucoma drainage devices in the management of uveitic glaucoma.
DESIGN: Retrospective, noncomparative case series.
PARTICIPANTS: Twenty-four eyes of 24 patients who underwent implantation of Baerveldt glaucoma drainage devices between 1996 and 2000 for the treatment of uveitic glaucoma refractory to medical therapy.
INTERVENTION: Implantation of Baerveldt glaucoma drainage device.
MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Control of intraocular pressure (IOP), number of glaucoma medications needed for adequate IOP control, visual acuity, complications associated with the surgery, and the effect of subsequent surgery on the ability of the device to control IOP. Success was defined as IOP >/=5 and </=21 mmHg with or without antiglaucoma medications and without need for further glaucoma surgery, loss of light perception, or phthisis.
RESULTS: Cumulative life-table success rates were 95.8% at 3 months and 91.7% at 6 months, 12 months, and 24 months. The mean postoperative follow-up was 20.8 months. The IOP was reduced from a preoperative mean of 30.5 +/- 8.96 mmHg with 3.1 +/- 0.99 antiglaucoma medications to a postoperative mean at 6 months or 1 year of 13.0 +/- 4.6 mmHg (P < 0.001) with 0.8 +/- 0.8 antiglaucoma medications (P < 0.001). At last follow-up 14 of 24 eyes (58.3%) required no antiglaucoma medications. Best-corrected visual acuity improved or remained within 2 lines of preoperative visual acuity in 19 (79.2%) eyes. The most common complications were choroidal effusions in four (16.7%), hypotony in three (12.5%) eyes, cystoid macular edema in three (12.5%) eyes, and failure of corneal grafts in two (8.3%). Seven of 22 eyes (31.8%) in which successful control of IOP with the Baerveldt implant was achieved underwent subsequent nonglaucoma-related incisional surgery. None of these eyes (0%) lost IOP control after the subsequent procedure.
CONCLUSIONS: The Baerveldt glaucoma drainage device offers reasonable safety and effectiveness for the control of IOP in eyes with uveitis and refractory glaucoma.",26,2002-Dec-1

In early S-antigen induced experimental uveitis (EAU), photoreceptor mitochondrial proteins are nitrated prior to macrophage infiltration of the retina, suggesting that oxidative stress is an initial event in the development of EAU. We attempted to detect the oxidative stress and localise it in the EAU retina.
METHODS: Lewis rats were immunised with S-antigen in complete Freund's adjuvant (CFA). Animals were injected with CFA alone and non-immunised animals served as controls. Immunised and non-immunised animals were killed on day 5 and subsequent days. Isolated retinas were processed for inducible nitric oxide synthase (iNOS), tumour necrosis factor (TNF)alpha, interferon (IFN)gamma, interleukin (IL)Ialpha and CD28 expression by real time polymerase chain reaction. In addition, iNOS was colocalised with cytochrome c oxidase on day 5 of EAU. Oxidative stress was detected by 2', 7'-dichlorodihydrofluorescein diacetate and localised by a mitochondrial specific marker. Leucocyte and T cell infiltration in the retina/choroid was evaluated by immunohistochemistry.
RESULTS: The iNOS, TNFalpha, IFNgamma, IL1alpha and CD28 transcripts were significantly upregulated on day 5 in EAU, and iNOS was colocalised with cytochrome c oxidase in the photoreceptor mitochondria. Oxidative stress was seen primarily in the photoreceptor mitochondria. Occasional T cells were present in the retina at this stage.
CONCLUSIONS: During early EAU, mitochondrial oxidative stress is selectively noted in the photoreceptor inner segments. The oxidative stress appears to result from iNOS upregulation in the photoreceptor mitochondria and cytokine generation in the retina by a few antigen specific infiltrating T cells.",26,2007-Apr-1

Nearly one-half of all uveitis cases seen at tertiary referral centers have no identifiable cause. Many systemic, paraocular, intraocular, topical medications, and even vaccines can induce intraocular inflammation, scleritis, and rarely orbititis and are often overlooked as causes of uveitis. This review was undertaken to elucidate the strength of association of these medications with uveitis and to make clinicians aware of these associations, especially among newer medications.
RECENT FINDINGS: Medication-induced uveitis has become particularly important and more frequently seen because of the advent of biologic therapies such as immune checkpoint inhibitors (ICPIs), BRAF, and MEK inhibitors, antivascular endothelial growth factor agents, and antitumor necrosis factor agents, as well as newer systemic bisphosphonates are strongly associated with uveitis.
SUMMARY: The ever-broadening scope of pharmaceuticals now available to treat previously untreatable conditions, such as advanced metastatic cutaneous melanoma, have resulted in unintended ocular inflammatory diseases. Ophthalmologists must recognize that drugs such as ICPIs, BRAF, and MEK inhibitors, anti-vascular endothelial growth factor agents, tumor necrosis factor-α inhibitors, cidofovir, bisphosphonates, topical prostaglandin analogues, topical brimonidine, BCG vaccination can cause of uveitis. Utilizing a thorough review of systems, physicians may readily identify medications that may cause uveitis and avoid expensive and unnecessary laboratory testing.",26,2018-Nov-1

Cyclosporin A (CS-A), a selective inhibitor of T lymphocytes, is reported here to prevent S antigen (S-Ag) induced uveitis in Lewis rats. The S-Ag, found in all mammalian retinas, is uveitogenic under experimental conditions and patients with certain uveitic entities demonstrate cell mediated responses to this antigen. Daily treatment with CS-A (10 mg/kg) begun on the same day as S-Ag immunization totally inhibited the development of the uveitis in this experimental autoimmune model. Moreover a greater CS-A dose (40 mg/kg) efficiently prevented the disease process when therapy was started 7 d after S-Ag immunization. Anti-S-Ag antibody titers were observed to be similar in rats either protected or not protected with CS-A. Our data support strongly the need for T cell participation in this disease model. Since ocular inflammatory disease is an important cause of visual impairment, the data further suggest that CS-A may be useful in the treatment of patients with intractable uveitis.",26,1981-Apr-1

To ascertain resource use, costs and risk of workforce absence in non-infectious uveitis cases versus matched controls.
METHODS: In a retrospective claims analysis of employees in the United States, prevalent (N = 705) and incident (N = 776) cases 18-64 years old with ≥2 diagnoses of non-infectious intermediate, posterior or panuveitis were matched 1:1 to controls without uveitis. Persistent prevalent cases (treated for ≥90 days, N = 112) also were analysed. Outcomes were annual direct resource use and costs associated with inpatient stays; emergency department, outpatient and ophthalmologist/optometrist visits; and prescription drugs. Indirect resource use and costs associated with work loss from disability and medically related absenteeism also were compared. Multivariate regression assessed cost differences between cases and controls.
RESULTS: Cases had significantly (p < 0.05) more medical resource use versus controls including 0.4 versus 0.2 emergency visits and 16.5 versus 7.6 outpatient/other visits. Cases used more prescription drugs (7.8 versus 4.1) and had more disability days (10.3 versus 4.6), medically related absenteeism days (8.5 versus 3.8), and work loss days (18.7 versus 8.4) than controls (all p < 0.05). Total direct ($12 940 versus $3730) and indirect ($3144 versus $1378) costs were higher in cases than controls (all p < 0.05). Results for persistent cases suggested greater utilization and associated cost and work loss burden. Compared with controls, cases had significantly greater risks of workforce absence, leave of absence and long-term disability (all p < 0.05).
CONCLUSION: Non-infectious intermediate, posterior or panuveitis, particularly persistent disease, is associated with substantial medical and work loss costs suggesting an unmet need for more effective treatments.",26,2016-Aug-1

To determine whether disorganization of retinal inner layers (DRIL) assessed by spectral-domain optical coherence tomography (SDOCT) correlates with visual acuity (VA) in eyes with uveitic cystoid macular edema (CME).
DESIGN: Secondary analysis of randomized clinical trial data.
METHODS: Fifty-six eyes of 42 patients with uveitic CME were prospectively imaged as part of the VISUAL-1 trial (Clinicaltrials.gov identifier NCT01138657). Central subfield thickness (CFT), horizontal and vertical extent of DRIL, foveal DRIL (>500 μm DRIL) hyperreflective foci (HRF), average and largest area of intraretinal (IR) cysts, and extent of disruption of external limiting membrane (ELM) and ellipsoid zone (EZ) were determined within the 1-mm central subfield and correlated with VA at baseline and follow-up visits.
RESULTS: Regression analysis adjusted for clustered observations was used to examine the association between OCT morphologic parameters and VA. Across all visits (n = 168), significant associations were found for CFT (0.080 per 100 μm, P < .001), foveal DRIL (0.170, P < .001), horizontal DRIL length (0.055 per 100 μm, P < .001), vertical DRIL extent (0.001, P = .005), total area of IR cysts (0.204 per mm
CONCLUSION: DRIL is a robust and easily obtained surrogate marker of VA in participants with current or resolved uveitic CME. CFT, DRIL, IR cyst area, EZ disruption, and HRF had a strong association with VA.",26,2017-May-1

Uveitis is a major cause of blindness, with the visual loss that occurs being due primarily to retinal tissue damage. The tissue damage is mediated mainly by phagocytic inflammatory cells, such as macrophages, by the release of various proteolytic enzymes, arachidonic acid metabolites, cytokines and free radicals. The latter are found to be potent cytotoxic agents that readily cause tissue damage by peroxidation of lipid cell membranes. Recent studies of experimental uveitis indicate that other potent oxidants are generated in uveitis by macrophages. One of these is ONOO-, which is formed from *NO and O(-)2. The macrophages generate *NO preferentially in the outer retina following iNOS expression. In these phagocytes, outer retinal proteins, especially arrestin, are found to be potent iNOS inducers. Current studies of RPE show that these cells protect the retina from ONOO- mediated damage in uveitis by releasing a novel protein called retinal pigment epithelial protective protein. This protein is found to suppress O(-)2 and *NO generation by the phagocytes, in both in vitro and in vivo uveitis models. The protective protein expression is restricted to RPE, its suppressive effect is a result of the inhibition of the phosphorylation of cytosolic proteins, p47-phox, required for the assembly of NADPH and activation of NFkappaB, which are required for generation of 0(-)2 and expression of iNOS respectively. Either pharmacologically or chemically, up-regulation of RPP generation could help in preventing retinal degeneration in uveitis or other degenerative dis",26,2000-Jan-1

Sunset glow fundus is considered an important ocular finding for diagnosing and understanding the pathogenesis of Vogt-Koyanagi-Harada (VKH) disease. In this study, we investigated the association between the incidence of chronic ocular inflammation in VKH disease and the appearance of sunset glow fundus.
METHODS: The study was a retrospective noncomparative interventional case series. Eighty patients with VKH disease treated with high-dose corticosteroid therapy from initial onset were included in the study. We compared the incidence of sunset glow fundus between patients with VKH disease with chronic ocular inflammation lasting more than 6 months and those without chronic ocular inflammation.
RESULTS: Chronic ocular inflammation was seen in 14 of 80 patients (17.5%). The presence of severe anterior uveitis were significantly more frequent in the chronic group. Forty-one patients (62%) without chronic ocular inflammation showed sunset glow fundus, while 13 patients (93%) with chronic ocular inflammation developed sunset glow fundus. Duration from disease onset to appearance of sunset glow fundus was significantly shorter in patients with than in patients without chronic inflammation.
CONCLUSIONS: There is a significant association between the incidence of chronic ocular inflammation lasting more than 6 months and the appearance of sunset glow fundus. In addition, more severe disease at onset might be associated with chronic ocular inflammation in VKH disease.",26,2002-Oct-1

PMID: 16282154
Sympathetic ophthalmia is a rare, bilateral granulomatous uveitis that occurs after either surgical or accidental trauma to one eye. The ocular inflammation in the fellow eye becomes apparent usually within 3 months after injury. Clinical presentation is an insidious or acute anterior uveitis with mutton-fat keratic precipitates. The posterior segment manifests moderate to severe vitritis, usually accompanied by multiple yellowish-white choroidal lesions. Evidence suggests that sympathetic ophthalmia represents an autoimmune inflammatory response against choroidal melanocytes mediated by T cells. Diagnosis is based on clinical findings and a history of previous ocular trauma or surgery. Other causes of granulomatous uveitis, such as Vogt-Koyanagi-Harada disease, sarcoidosis, tuberculosis, and syphilis should be considered. Treatment of sympathetic ophthalmia consists of systemic anti-inflammatory agents with high dose oral corticosteroid as the drug of choice. However, if the inflammation cannot be controlled, cyclosporine is then used. Other immunosuppressive agents, such as chlorambucil, cyclophosphamide or azathioprine, may be necessary for the control of inflammation. The role of enucleation after the diagnosis of sympathetic ophthalmia remains controversial. Visual prognosis is reasonably good with prompt wound repair and appropriate immunomodulatory therapy.",26,2005-1-1

To investigate the therapeutic effects of metformin, a commonly used antidiabetic drug, in preventing endotoxin-induced uveitis (EIU) in rats.
METHODS: EIU in Lewis rats was developed by subcutaneous injection of lipopolysaccharide (LPS; 150 μg). Metformin (300 mg/kg body weight, intraperitoneally) or its carrier was injected either 12 hours before or 2 hours after LPS induction. Three and 24 hours after EIU, eyes were enucleated and aqueous humor (AqH) was collected. The MILLIPLEX-MAG Rat cytokine-chemokine magnetic bead array was used to determine inflammatory cytokines. The expression of Cox-2, phosphorylation of AMPK, and NF-κB (p65) were determined immunohistochemically. Primary human nonpigmented ciliary epithelial cells (HNPECs) were used to determine the in vitro efficacy of metformin.
RESULTS: Compared with controls, the EIU rat AqH had significantly increased number of infiltrating cells and increased levels of various cytokines and chemokines (TNF-α, MCP-1, IL-1β, MIP-1α, IL-6, Leptin, and IL-18) and metformin significantly prevented the increase. Metformin also prevented the expression of Cox-2 and phosphorylation of p65, and increased the activation of AMPK in the ciliary bodies and retinal tissues. Moreover, metformin prevented the expression of Cox-2, iNOS, and activation of NF-kB in the HNPECs and decreased the levels of NO and PGE2 in cell culture media.
CONCLUSIONS: Our results for the first time demonstrate a novel role of the antidiabetic drug, metformin, in suppressing uveitis in rats and suggest that this drug could be developed to prevent uveitis complications.",26,2012-Jun-08

Uveitis is an inflammation of the middle layer of the eye with a high risk of blindness. The Gi protein associated A3 adenosine receptor (A3AR) is highly expressed in inflammatory cells whereas low expression is found in normal cells. CF101 is a highly specific agonist at the A3AR known to induce a robust anti-inflammatory effect in different experimental animal models. The CF101 mechanism of action entails down-regulation of the NF-κB-TNF-α signaling pathway, resulting in inhibition of pro-inflammatory cytokine production and apoptosis of inflammatory cells. In this study the effect of CF101 on the development of retinal antigen interphotoreceptor retinoid-binding protein (IRBP)-induced experimental autoimmune uveitis (EAU) was assessed. Oral treatment with CF101 (10 µg/kg, twice daily), initiated upon disease onset, improved uveitis clinical score measured by fundoscopy and ameliorated the pathological manifestations of the disease. Shortly after treatment with CF101 A3AR expression levels were down-regulated in the lymph node and spleen cells pointing towards receptor activation. Downstream events included a decrease in PI3K and STAT-1 and proliferation inhibition of IRPB auto-reactive T cells ex vivo. Inhibition of interleukin-2, tumor necrosis factor-α (TNF-α) and interferon-γ (IFN-γ) production and up-regulation of interleukin-10 was found in cultured splenocytes derived from CF101-treated animals. Overall, the present study data point towards a marked anti-inflammatory effect of CF101 in EAU and support further exploration of this small molecule drug for the treatment of uveitis.",26,2011-Nov-1

To investigate whether a synthetic LXR agonist TO901317 (TO90) ameliorates ocular inflammation in a mouse model of experimental autoimmune uveitis (EAU) and to explore its underlying mechanism.
METHODS: EAU was induced with subcutaneous injection of IRBP161-180 peptide (SGIPYIISYLHPGNTILHVD) in B10.RIII mice. TO90 (50 mg/kg/d) or vehicle was administrated orally for successive 16 days or 8 days as prevention or effector phase, respectively. The severity of EAU was evaluated with clinical and histological scores. The levels of LXRs, NF-κB subunit p65, and an LXR target gene ABCA1 in the retina were detected with real-time PCR and Western blotting. The expressions of proinflammatory genes, including TNF-α, IL-1β, IL-6, MCP-1, IFN-γ, and IL-17, were detected by real-time PCR. IRBP-specific lymphocyte proliferation was detected by MTT. Intracellular IFN-γ and IL-17 in CD4(+) T cells were measured by flow cytometry.
RESULTS: We found both LXRα and LXRβ were expressed in mouse retina. After administering TO90 orally to B10.RIII mice, the expression of LXRα but not LXRβ was upregulated in the naïve mice. Compared with naïve mice, LXRα expression was increased in vehicle and TO90-treated EAU mice, but the LXRβ expression was unchanged. The protein level of ABCA1 was enhanced in TO90-treated naïve and EAU mice but was unchanged in vehicle-treated EAU mice, suggesting activation of LXRα by TO90 is ligand dependent. TO90-mediated activation of LXRα improved the clinical and morphological scores in EAU mice. Meanwhile, activation of LXRα decreased the expressions of proinflammatory cytokines, including TNF-α, IL-1β, IL-6, MCP-1, IFN-γ, and IL-17 in the retina. TO90 treatment inhibited IRBP-specific immune responses. The proportions of Th1 and Th17 expressing IFN-γ and IL-17 were reduced in TO90-treated EAU mice in both prevention and effector phases. Furthermore, TO90 significantly downregulated the expressions of an NF-κB subunit p65 at the protein and mRNA levels.
CONCLUSIONS: TO90 activates LXRα and potently attenuates ocular inflammation in EAU. Alleviation of ocular inflammation could partially result from inhibition of the NF-κB signaling pathway. TO90 reduces IFN-γ and IL-17 expression in both prevention and treatment scenarios. Our data suggest that the LXR agonist may become a novel class of therapeutic agent for autoimmune uveitis.",26,2014-Apr-28

To test whether retinal pigment epithelial (RPE) cells are able to induce myeloid-derived suppressor cell (MDSC) differentiation from bone marrow (BM) progenitors.
METHODS: BM cells were cocultured with or without RPE cells in the presence of GM-CSF and IL-4. Numbers of resultant MDSCs were assessed by flow cytometry after 6 days of incubation. The ability of the RPE cell-induced MDSCs to inhibit T cells was evaluated by a CFSE-based T-cell proliferation assay. To explore the mechanism by which RPE cells induce MDSC differentiation, PD-L1-deficient RPE cells and blocking antibodies against TGF-β, CTLA-2α, and IL-6 were used. RPE cell-induced MDSCs were adoptively transferred into mice immunized with interphotoreceptor retinoid-binding protein in complete Freund's adjuvant to test their efficacy in suppressing autoreactive T-cell responses in experimental autoimmune uveitis (EAU).
RESULTS: RPE cells induced the differentiation of MDSCs. These RPE cell-induced MDSCs significantly inhibited T-cell proliferation in a dose-dependent manner. PD-L1-deficient RPE cells induced MDSC differentiation as efficiently as wild-type RPE cells, and neutralizing TGF-β or CTLA-2α did not alter the numbers of induced MDSCs. However, blocking IL-6 reduced the efficacy of RPE cell-induced MDSC differentiation. Finally, adoptive transfer of RPE cell-induced MDSCs suppressed IRBP-specific T-cell responses that led to EAU.
CONCLUSIONS: RPE cells induce the differentiation of MDSCs from bone marrow progenitors. Both cell surface molecules and soluble factors are important in inducing MDSC differentiation. PD-L1, TGF-β, and CTLA-2α were not measurably involved in RPE cell-induced MDSC differentiation, whereas IL-6 was important in the process. The induction of MDSCs could be another mechanism by which RPE cells control immune reactions in the retina, and RPE cell-induced MDSCs should be further investigated as a potential approach to therapy for autoimmune posterior uveitis.",26,2012-Feb-1

To develop recommendations for the screening, monitoring, and treatment of uveitis in children with juvenile idiopathic arthritis (JIA).
METHODS: Pediatric rheumatologists, ophthalmologists with expertise in uveitis, patient representatives, and methodologists generated key clinical questions to be addressed by this guideline. This was followed by a systematic literature review and rating of the available evidence according to the GRADE (Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development and Evaluation) methodology. A group consensus process was used to compose the final recommendations and grade their strength as conditional or strong.
RESULTS: Due to a lack of literature with good quality of evidence, recommendations were formulated on the basis of available evidence and a consensus expert opinion. Regular ophthalmic screening of children with JIA is recommended because of the risk of uveitis, and the frequency of screening should be based on individual risk factors. Regular ophthalmic monitoring of children with uveitis is recommended, and intervals should be based on ocular examination findings and treatment regimen. Ophthalmic monitoring recommendations were strong primarily because of concerns of vision-threatening complications of uveitis with infrequent monitoring. Topical glucocorticoids should be used as initial treatment to achieve control of inflammation. Methotrexate and the monoclonal antibody tumor necrosis factor inhibitors adalimumab and infliximab are recommended when systemic treatment is needed for the management of uveitis. The timely addition of nonbiologic and biologic drugs is recommended to maintain uveitis control in children who are at continued risk of vision loss.
CONCLUSION: This guideline provides direction for clinicians and patients/parents making decisions on the screening, monitoring, and management of children with JIA and uveitis, using GRADE methodology and informed by a consensus process with input from rheumatology and ophthalmology experts, current literature, and patient/parent preferences and values.",26,2019-Jun-1

To describe the findings seen on optical coherence tomography angiography (OCTA) in patients with punctate inner choroidopathy (PIC) and multifocal choroiditis and panuveitis (MCP) complicated by choroidal neovascular membranes.
METHODS: This was an Institutional Review Board-approved prospective, descriptive case series. 12 patients with PIC and MCP complicated by choroidal neovascularisation (CNV) were included. Each patient underwent slit-lamp examination by a uveitis specialist followed by conventional spectral domain OCT imaging of the macula. OCTA images of the macula were then obtained.
RESULTS: 12 patients were enrolled in the study, out of which 9 patients were followed longitudinally. CNV was identified in 11 of the 12 patients. In all patients where fluorescein angiography (FA) was inconclusive for presence of CNV, OCTA identified CNV. Various lesions on OCT suggestive of activity correlated with changes in the vascular structure of OCTA to confirm suspicion of clinical activity.
CONCLUSION: In patients with PIC and MCP complicated by CNV, OCTA successfully identified underlying CNV. Given the difficulty of differentiating inflammatory lesions from early CNV on OCT and FA, OCTA may provide a valuable method of monitoring patients with posterior uveitis highly correlated with development of CNV.",26,2017-May-1

To evaluate the uveal and capsular biocompatibility of hydrophilic acrylic, hydrophobic acrylic, and silicone intraocular lenses (IOLs) in eyes with uveitis.
SETTING: Department of Ophthalmology, University of Vienna, Vienna, Austria.
METHODS: This prospective study comprised 72 eyes with uveitis and 68 control eyes having phacoemulsification and IOL implantation by 1 surgeon. Patients received 1 of the following IOLs: foldable hydrophilic acrylic (Hydroview, Bausch & Lomb), hydrophobic acrylic (AcrySof, Alcon), or silicone (CeeOn 911, Pharmacia). Postoperative evaluations were at 1, 3, and 7 days and 1, 3, and 6 months. Cell reaction was evaluated by specular microscopy of the anterior IOL surface and the anterior and posterior capsule reaction, by biomicroscopy.
RESULTS: Small round cell deposition was observed on all IOLs in the immediate postoperative period, especially in eyes with uveitis. This reaction decreased 3 to 6 months after surgery. Although the CeeOn 911 had a higher mean grade of small cells, there was no statistical difference between the 3 IOL types after 6 months in the uveitis and control groups. Foreign-body giant cells (FBGCs) increased after 1 week to 1 month. The AcrySof IOLs had the highest number of FBGCs; after 6 months, there was a statistically significant difference between the AcrySof and Hydroview uveitis groups (P =.036) and the AcrySof and CeeOn 911 uveitis groups (P =.003) but there was no difference among the 3 IOL types in the control group. Lens epithelial cell outgrowth persisted on the Hydroview IOLs in control eyes and regressed on all 3 IOL types in uveitic eyes and on the AcrySof and CeeOn 911 IOLs in control eyes (P =.0001). Anterior capsule opacification (ACO) was more severe on all IOL types in uveitic eyes and on the CeeOn 911 IOL in control eyes. Posterior capsule opacification (PCO) was more severe in uveitic eyes. The Hydroview group had more severe PCO than the AcrySof and the CeeOn 911 groups in uveitis and control eyes. Six months postoperatively, the difference was significant (P =.0001). There was no significant difference between the AcrySof and CeeOn 911 IOLs.
CONCLUSIONS: Intraocular lens biocompatibility is inversely related to inflammation. Hydrophilic acrylic material had good uveal but worse capsular biocompatibility. Hydrophobic acrylic material had lower uveal but better capsular biocompatibility. Silicone showed a higher small cell count (mild) and more severe ACO but achieved PCO results comparable to FBGC results and better than those with the AcrySof lens 6 months after surgery. Despite the differences in IOL biocompatibility, all patients benefited from the surgery.",26,2002-Jul-1

: Bevacizumab is a monoclonal antibody to vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) which has been successfully used for the treatment of age-related macular degeneration with choroidal neovascularization. As VEGF is involved in the pathomechanisms of inflammation and endothelial dysfunction the authors used bevacizumab as a last resort treatment in patients with persistent uveitic cystoid macular edema (CME).
PATIENTS AND METHODS: : Persistent uveitic CME was defined by optical coherence tomography (OCT) measurements >250 mum despite previous treatments. The authors reviewed patients with persistent CME who subsequently had been treated with intravitreous bevacizumab 1.25 or 2.5 mg. Improvement was judged by visual acuity (VA) gain >/=2 lines and thickness reduction in OCT.
RESULTS: : Eleven eyes of 10 patients were injected since February 2006. Median follow-up was 70 days. Reduction in central retinal thickness could be seen as early as 2 weeks with a mean foveal thickness reduction of 127.2 mum at 4 weeks. Concurrent improvement in VA was seen in 4 of 10 patients, and was unchanged in the others. Four patients received two injections and five patients received three injections. Except for progression of cataract in one eye no ocular or systemic adverse events were recorded.
CONCLUSIONS: : Intravitreal bevacizumab seems to be an effective and safe treatment in the management of refractory inflammatory CME. The effect is transient, and reinjections may be necessary, although the time until reinjection is needed differs individually.",26,2008-Jan-1

Previous epidemiologic studies of uveitis have focused on predominantly Caucasian populations, and none have been based in the Southeast. We analyzed the epidemiology of uveitis among a referral population with a high percentage of African Americans in the United States.
METHODS: We evaluated demographic data from 385 consecutive patients referred to the Duke Uveitis Clinic.
RESULTS: Of the 385 patients, 120 (31%) were African American and 258 (67%) Caucasian; 237 (62%) were female and 148 (38%) male. The most common diagnoses among the 385 patients were idiopathic panuveitis (64 patients [17%]), idiopathic anterior uveitis (47 patients [12%]), pars planitis (46 patients [12%]), sarcoidosis (44 patients [11%]), and toxoplasmosis (39 patients [10%]). These diagnoses were also the most common among the 120 African American patients: 33 patients (28%) had idiopathic panuveitis, 30 (25%) had sarcoidosis, 10 (8%) had idiopathic anterior uveitis, 8 (7%) had toxoplasmosis, and 6 (5%) had pars planitis. Among the 258 Caucasian patients, the most common diagnoses were pars planitis (39 patients [15%]), idiopathic anterior uveitis (37 patients [14%]), toxoplasmosis (30 patients [12%]), idiopathic panuveitis (28 patients [11%]), and multifocal choroiditis and panuveitis (MCP) (17 patients [7%]). Categorizing diagnoses of all 385 patients by anatomic location, panuveitis was most frequent (148 patients [38%]), followed by anterior uveitis (97 patients [25%]), posterior uveitis (93 patients [24%]), and intermediate uveitis (47 patients [12%]).
CONCLUSIONS: The higher frequency of sarcoidosis and idiopathic panuveitis than previously reported is related to our larger African American population base. The racial composition of the Southeast does not, however, account for differences such as our higher percentage of MCP; it is possible that other genetic or environmental factors play a role in this region.",26,1997-Sep-1

Juvenile idiopathic arthritis (JIA) is the most common rheumatic disease in children. Children with JIA are at risk of inflammation of the uvea in the eye (uveitis). Overall, 20% to 25% of paediatric uveitis is associated with JIA. Major risk factors for development of uveitis in JIA are oligoarticular pattern of arthritis, an age at onset of arthritis of less than seven years of age, and antinuclear antibody positivity. In the initial stages of mild to moderate inflammation the uveitis is asymptomatic. This has led to current practice of screening all children with JIA for uveitis. Approximately 12% to 38% of patients with JIA develop uveitis in seven years following onset of arthritis. In 30% to 50% of children with JIA-associated uveitis structural complications are present at diagnosis. Furthermore about 50% to 75% of those with severe uveitis will eventually develop visual impairment secondary to ocular complications such as cataract and glaucoma. Defining the severity of inflammation and structural complications in uveitis patients is now possible following Standardised Uveitis Nomenclature (SUN) guidelines, and modified to incorporate the consensus of end point and outcome criteria into the design of randomised trials. Despite current screening and therapeutic options (pre-biologics) 10% to 15% of children with JIA-associated uveitis may develop bilateral visual impairment and certified legally blind. To date, there remains no controlled trial evidence of benefits of biologic therapy.
METHODS/DESIGN: This study will randomise 154 patients aged 2 to 18 years with active JIA-associated uveitis (despite methotrexate (MTX) treatment for at least 12 weeks). All participants will be treated for 18 months, with follow up of 3 years from randomisation (continuing on MTX throughout). All participants will receive a stable dose of MTX and in addition either adalimumab (20 mg/0.8 ml for patients<30 kg or 40 mg/0.8 ml for patients weighing 30 kg or more, subcutaneous (s/c) injection every 2 weeks based on body weight), or placebo (0.8 ml as appropriate according to body weight) s/c injection every 2 weeks.
DISCUSSION: This is the first randomised controlled trial that will assess the clinical effectiveness, safety and cost effectiveness of adalimumab in combination with methotrexate for the treatment of juvenile idiopathic arthritis associated uveitis.

Optical coherence tomography (OCT) is a non-contact noninvasive technique that allows in vivo imaging of the retina, choroid, optic nerve head, retinal nerve fiber layer, and the anterior structures of the eye. It was introduced into clinical practice two decades ago. Advances in OCT technology have been achieved by searching ultra-high-resolution OCT, adaptive optics OCT, eye-tracking OCT, and changes in signal detection technique from time-domain (TD) to spectral-domain (SD) detection. Today, SD OCT has become a part of routine uveitis practice. Apart from its diagnostic value in uveitis, OCT has enabled objective assessment of treatment response and provided predictive value for visual recovery and prognosis of uveitic entities. It is the standard diagnostic technique in the detection, monitoring of treatment, and determination of prognosis in uveitic macular edema as well as other inflammatory macular pathologies, including epiretinal membrane formation, vitreomacular traction, foveal atrophy, and lamellar/full-thickness macular holes. OCT has also shed light on the pathophysiology of several posterior uveitic entities. SD OCT has enabled visualization of four lines in the sensory retina which represent the external limiting membrane, the photoreceptor inner and outer segment junction, the photoreceptor outer segment and the retina pigment epithelium junction, and the retina pigment epithelium-choriocapillaris complex. Thus, we have gained substantial information about the pathologic and structural changes in uveitic conditions with primary or secondary outer retinal involvement. SD OCT has also provided invaluable information on the inner retinal and the vitreoretinal interface changes in uveitic conditions. With the introduction of enhanced depth imaging, visualization of the choroid and choriocapillaries has become possible. Therefore, OCT has become an indispensible ancillary test in the diagnosis and management of inflammatory diseases involving the retina and/or the choroid. As OCT technology continues to develop further it will provide new insights into the retinal and choroidal structure and the pathogenesis of posterior uveitic entities.",26,2014-Apr-1

Melanocortin hormone system plays a key role in maintaining the homeostasis of our body via their neuro-immune-endocrine activities and regulates a diverse array of physiological functions, including melanogenesis, inflammation, immunomodulation, adrenocortical steroidogenesis, hemodynamics, natriuresis, energy homeostasis, sexual function, and exocrine secretion. The pathobiologic actions of all melanocortins are conveyed by melanocortin receptors. As the last melanocortin receptor to be cloned and characterized, melanocortin receptor 5 (MC5R) is widely expressed in both central nervous system and a number of peripheral organ systems in man. However, the exact effect of the MC5R mediated melanocortinergic signaling remains largely uncertain. Owing to the recent advances in developing highly selective peptidomimetic agonists and antagonists of MC5R and also to studies in MC5R knockout animals, our understanding of MC5R pathobiology has been greatly expanded and strengthened. Evidence suggests that MC5R plays a key role in governing immune reaction and inflammatory response, and is pivotal for the regulation of sexual behavior, thermoregulation, and exocrine secretion, like sebogenesis, lacrimal secretion and release of sex pheromones. As such, recent translational efforts have focused on developing novel sebum-suppressive therapies for seborrhoea and acne vulgaris based on antagonizing MC5R. Conversely, selective MC5R agonists have demonstrated promising beneficial effects in immune-mediated diseases, metabolic endocrinopathies and other disease conditions, such as glomerular diseases and dry eyes, skin and mouth. Thus, MC5R-mediated signaling is essential for health. Therapeutic targeting of MC5R represents a promising and pragmatic therapeutic strategy for diverse diseases. This review article delineates the biophysiology of MC5R-mediated biophysiology of the melanocortin hormone system, discusses the existing data on MC5R-targeted therapy in experimental disease models, and envisages the translational potential for treating human diseases.",26,2020-Oct-1

Uveitis is a leading causes of blindness worldwide, and the development of cataracts is common due to both the presence of intraocular inflammation and the most commonly employed treatment with corticosteroids. The management of these cataracts can be very challenging and often requires additional procedures that can compromise surgical results. The underlying disease affects a relatively young population at higher risk of complications. Preoperative control of inflammation/quiescent disease for at least three months is generally accepted as the minimum amount of time prior to surgical intervention. Phacoemulsification with intraocular lens is the preferred method for surgery, with some studies showing improvement in visual acuity in over 90% of patients. The most common postoperative complications include macular edema, posterior capsule opacification, recurrent or persistent inflammation, glaucoma, epiretinal membrane and IOL deposits, or dislocation. Despite the potential complications, cataract surgery in uveitis patients is considered a safe and successful procedure.",26,2018-1-1

Uveitis was induced rhesus monkeys immunized with purified retinal S-antigen. Focal retinal and subretinal infiltration, in addition to periphlebitic changes, were observed histologically. Immunized monkeys had similar cell-mediated in vitro immune responses to the S-antigen as do humans with posterior uveitis. Circulating immune complexes at the time of disease could not be detected. This primate model supports the notion that the S-antigen may play a role in human uveitis.",26,1981-Jun-1

The reported outcomes of ocular mycobacterial infection are commonly unfavorable. This study is among the first to elucidate factors associated with poor outcomes, as well as highlight the continued controversies in therapy, particularly the role of oral corticosteroids.
OBJECTIVE: To describe presentations and outcomes of mycobacterial ocular disease in the Midwestern United States. DESIGN Retrospective case series.
SETTING: A university-based uveitis clinic.
PARTICIPANTS: Twenty-six eyes of 17 patients with mycobacterial ocular inflammatory disease seen at University of Illinois at Chicago from 1995 to 2010.
MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Bivariate and regression analyses were performed to assess factors associated with delay in referral, relapse, and irreversible visual acuity loss (≤ 20/200).
RESULTS: Of 17 patients, 13 had isolated ocular disease, 1 had miliary tuberculosis (TB), 2 had TB lymphadenopathy, and 1 had active pulmonary TB. Fourteen had Mycobacterium tuberculosis and 3 had nontuberculous mycobacterial infection. Chest imaging was consistent with granulomatous disease in 46.7%. Average delay from ocular disease onset to uveitis service referral was 755.3 days. Posterior uveitis and non-Hispanic white race were associated with increased delay. A relapsing course was observed in posterior uveitis (odds ratio [OR], 20.0; 95% CI, 1.39-287; P = .03) and those treated with systemic steroids for eye disease (OR, 10.1; 95% CI,1.60-64.0; P = .01). Disease control was achieved in 81%, although 38.5% had profound visual loss, associated with age older than 50 years and delay in diagnosis. Patients diagnosed after 500 days from initial ocular symptoms were more likely to lose vision (OR, 20.0; 95% CI, 1.41-282; P = .03).
CONCLUSIONS: Ocular mycobacterial infection occurs in nonendemic areas and cannot be ruled out with negative chest imaging. Tuberculosis and atypical mycobacterial infection should be in the differential diagnosis of ocular inflammation, regardless of patient ethnicity. Significant delays exist in instituting antimicrobial treatment, associated with increased morbidity. Early referral is necessary for patients not responding appropriately to anti-inflammatory therapy.",26,2013-Jun-1

To assess the efficacy of the anti-TNF monoclonal antibody infliximab in uveitis patients without clinically evident ocular inflammation and impaired visual acuity because of chronic cystoid macular edema (CME).
DESIGN: Prospective, noncomparative, interventional case series.
METHODS: Patients with refractory CME (14 eyes, mean duration of 14 months), associated with intermediate uveitis (n = 6), Adamantiades-Behcet disease (n = 2), adult-type vascular pseudotumor (n = 1), and HLAB27+-related uveitis (n = 1) received an intravenous infliximab infusion (5 mg/kg); five patients were retreated after 1 month.
RESULTS: Macular thickness, measured by ocular coherence tomography, was reduced from 428 +/- 138 microm to 219 +/- 51 microm at 2 months postbaseline (P = .0001), while visual acuity increased from 0.41 +/- 0.18 to 0.83 +/- 0.17 (P < .00001). Anatomic and functional improvement was sustained at 6 months in all. No ocular or extra-ocular side effects were noted.
CONCLUSION: These promising results suggest that TNF may play an important pathogenetic role in chronic CME, thus, a controlled trial is warranted.",26,2004-Oct-1

PMID: 29538183
The intestinal commensal microbiota are important in shaping immune cell repertoire and are influenced by host genetics. Because of this intricate interaction, an intestinal dysbiosis has been associated with multiple immune-mediated polygenic diseases. This review summarizes the literature on how alterations in the intestinal microbiota contribute to immune-mediated ocular disease, and how to potentially target the gut microbiome for therapeutic benefit.
RECENT FINDINGS: Several groups have demonstrated the importance of the intestinal microbiome in uveitis pathogenesis. Two groups showed that altering the microbiota with oral antibiotics results in reduced uveitis severity, and another group demonstrated that a commensal bacterial antigen activates retina-specific autoreactive T cells, potentially indicating a commensal trigger for uveitis. We have found that commensal bacterial metabolites, short chain fatty acids, can suppress autoimmune uveitis. Age-related macular degeneration is associated with an intestinal dysbiosis, which can be influenced by genetic risk alleles and age-related eye disease study (AREDS) supplementation. Strategies that might be effective for targeting the intestinal microbiota might involve several approaches, including the use of antibiotics, drugs that supplement beneficial bacterial components or target inflammatory bacterial strains, dietary strategies or microbial transplantation.
SUMMARY: The intestinal microbiota are potentially crucial in propagating inflammatory diseases of the eye, and can be targeted for therapeutic benefit.",26,2018-May-1

In the current study, we showed that in vivo administration of an anti-CD25 Ab (PC61) decreased the Th17 response in C57BL/6 mice immunized with the uveitogenic peptide interphotoreceptor retinoid-binding protein, while enhancing the autoreactive Th1 response. The depressed Th17 response was closely associated with decreased numbers of a splenic dendritic cell (DC) subset expressing CD11c(+)CD3(-)CD25(+) and decreased expansion of γδ T cells. We demonstrated that ablation of the CD25(+) DC subset accounted for the decreased activation and the expansion of γδ T cells, leading to decreased activation of IL-17(+) interphotoreceptor retinoid-binding protein-specific T cells. Our results show that an enhanced Th17 response in an autoimmune disease is associated with the appearance of a DC subset expressing CD25 and that treatment of mice with anti-CD25 Ab causes functional alterations in a number of immune cell types, namely DCs and γδ T cells, in addition to CD25(+)αβTCR(+) regulatory T cells.",25,2012-Jun-01

Uveitis is a diverse group of potentially sight-threatening intraocular inflammatory diseases and pathology derives from sustained production of pro-inflammatory cytokines in the optical axis. Although topical or systemic steroids are effective therapies, their adverse effects preclude prolonged usage and are impetus for seeking alternative immunosuppressive agents, particularly for patients with refractory uveitis. In this study, we synthesized a 16 amino acid membrane-penetrating lipophilic suppressor of cytokine signaling 1 peptide (SOCS1-KIR) that inhibits JAK/STAT signaling pathways and show that it suppresses and ameliorates experimental autoimmune uveitis (EAU), the mouse model of human uveitis. Fundus images, histological and optical coherence tomography analysis of eyes showed significant suppression of clinical disease, with average clinical score of 0.5 compared to 2.0 observed in control mice treated with scrambled peptide. We further show that SOCS1-KIR conferred protection from ocular pathology by inhibiting the expansion of pathogenic Th17 cells and inhibiting trafficking of inflammatory cells into the neuroretina during EAU. Dark-adapted scotopic and photopic electroretinograms further reveal that SOCS1-KIR prevented decrement of retinal function, underscoring potential neuroprotective effects of SOCS1-KIR in uveitis. Importantly, SOCS1-KIR is non-toxic, suggesting that topical administration of SOCS1-Mimetics can be exploited as a non-invasive treatment for uveitis and for limiting cytokine-mediated pathology in other ocular inflammatory diseases including scleritis.",25,2015-Aug-1

Optical coherence tomography (OCT) has dramatically changed the understanding and management of uveitis and other ocular conditions. Currently, OCT angiography (OCTA) combines structural information with the visualization of blood flow within the imaged area. The aim of this review is to present the basic principles of OCT and OCTA interpretation and to investigate the role of these imaging techniques in the diagnosis and management of uveitis. Common complications of intraocular inflammation such as macular oedema and inflammatory choroidal neovascularization are often diagnosed and followed with OCT/OCTA scans. However, uveitis specialists can obtain much more information from tomographic scans. This review provides a comprehensive description of typical OCT/OCTA findings characterizing different ocular structures in uveitis, proceeding from the cornea to the choroid. A careful interpretation of OCT/OCTA images can help in the differential diagnosis, the prediction of clinical outcomes, and the follow-up of patients with uveitis.",25,2019-Apr-1

Ocular inflammation was induced by intravitreal bovine serum albumin (BSA) injection in one eye of each of six cynomolgus monkeys. The fellow eyes were injected with sterile saline alone. The intraocular pressure decreased by 12.2 +/- 1.3 mmHg (mean +/- SE) 2 days after BSA injection and 4.0 +/- 1.1 mmHg after saline injection. Aqueous flow and uveoscleral outflow were determined with fluorescein isothiocyanate (FITC) dextran 70. Aqueous flow in inflamed eyes averaged 0.32 +/- 0.04 ul/min, less than half the rate of control eyes (0.77 +/- 0.08 ul/min, P = 0.01). The facility of uveoscleral outflow in inflamed eyes was four times that of control eyes (0.2 +/- 0.03 vs 0.05 +/- 0.01 ul/min/mmHg, respectively, P = 0.009). Fluorescence microscopic examination revealed intense fluorescence of the edematous ciliary body muscle and of the suprachoroidal space extending to the posterior pole. These findings indicate that BSA-induced ocular inflammation causes a simultaneous reduction in aqueous humor flow and an increase in uveoscleral outflow, resulting in ocular hypotony.",25,1987-Mar-1

The association between juvenile arthritis and uveitis is reviewed. Some children with the HLA-B27 related spondyloarthropathies develop anterior uveitis. About 20% of patients with juvenile rheumatoid arthritis (JRA) who are negative for IgM rheumatoid factor develop a frequently bilateral, nongranulomatous chronic anterior uveitis. Risk factors for uveitis in JRA patients are: female gender, pauciarticular onset of arthritis, presence of circulating antinuclear antibodies, and the antigens HLA-DW5 and HLA-DPw2. Uveitis is rare after seven years or more have elapsed from the onset of arthritis. The visual prognosis in patients with uveitis is good in 25% and fair in 50%. The remaining 25% develop visual impairment from complicated cataract and/or secondary inflammatory glaucoma. The potential benefit of cytotoxic agents in the treatment of intractable uveitis is outweighed by the risk of serious side effects. The management of secondary inflammatory glaucoma is unsatisfactory, but the results of treatment of complicated cataracts by lensectomy-vitrectomy are good.",25,1990-1-1

The records of 100 patients (161 eyes) with uveitis were reviewed retrospectively to determine the prevalence of increased intraocular pressure, the forms of uveitis most commonly associated with glaucoma, and the forms that require specific glaucoma therapy. Secondary glaucoma was present in 23 patients (31 eyes): three of 24 patients with acute uveitis (three eyes, 12% of acute uveitis patients) and 20 of 76 patients with chronic uveitis (28 eyes, 26% of chronic uveitis patients). Eighteen patients (26 eyes, 78% of glaucoma patients) with chronic uveitis required long-term medical therapy to control intraocular pressure. Three patients (three eyes, 12% of glaucoma patients) with acute uveitis required short-term therapy to control intraocular pressure. The remaining two patients had transient increases in intraocular pressure that did not require treatment or that responded to treatment of intraocular inflammation alone. One patient with chronic uveitis (two eyes, 4% of glaucoma patients) required filtering surgery. At least five patients (eight eyes, 22% of glaucoma patients) had glaucomatous visual field defects. The results of this survey are consistent with the concept that secondary glaucoma is a management problem in patients with anterior segment inflammation and chronic rather than acute uveitis. An algorithm for the management of increased intraocular pressure in patients with uveitis is proposed.",25,1990-Apr-1

Investigation of subfoveal choroidal thickness in Behçet disease (BD) with enhanced depth imaging optical coherence tomography (EDI-OCT).
METHODS: The study included 35 patients with posterior uveitis (PU) associated with BD, 35 patients with BD without ocular involvement, and 30 healthy controls.
RESULTS: There were no significant differences between the groups in terms of age, gender, axial length, or spherical equivalent refractive error. The mean subfoveal choroidal thickness was thinner in eyes with PU than in eyes without PU and healthy controls (p = 0.026).
CONCLUSION: EDI-OCT is a beneficial test for evaluating choroid morphology in BD. Thinning of the subfoveal choroidal tissue has been observed in patients with BD-associated PU.",25,2013-Dec-1

The syndrome of tubulointerstitial nephritis and uveitis (TINU) is a multisystemic autoimmune disorder that may occur in response to various environmental triggers, including drugs and microbial pathogens. Evidence exists of HLA antigen-related genetic predisposition to developing TINU. The resulting inflammation affects chiefly the ocular uvea and renal tubules, although other organs may be involved. TINU is uncommon; only about 200 cases are on record since its original description 40 years ago, although it is possible that new ones are no longer being reported. Although its incidence is highest in children and adolescents, all ages may be affected. Renal and ocular inflammation may be clinically severe and persistent, but the prognosis for the majority of patients with TINU is favorable. Owing to its low prevalence, no standard therapeutic protocols have been established, but most reported cases have been treated with corticosteroids or other immunomodulatory agents. TINU has many features in common with sarcoidosis, the main clinical entity from which it must be distinguished. This article begins with an illustrative case vignette, followed by an overview of the syndrome and current theories regarding its pathogenesis.",25,2018-Jul-1

To evaluate the risks and quality-of-life (QoL) outcomes of fluocinolone acetonide implant versus systemic therapy with corticosteroid and immunosuppression when indicated for intermediate uveitis, posterior uveitis, and panuveitis.
DESIGN: Additional follow-up of a randomized trial cohort.
PARTICIPANTS: Two hundred fifty-five patients with intermediate uveitis, posterior uveitis, or panuveitis, randomized to implant or systemic therapy.
METHODS: Randomized subjects with intermediate uveitis, posterior uveitis, or panuveitis (479 eyes) were followed up over 54 months, with 79.2% completing the 54-month visit.
MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Local and systemic potential complications of the therapies and self-reported health utility and vision-related and generic health-related QoL were studied prospectively.
RESULTS: Among initially phakic eyes, cataract and cataract surgery occurred significantly more often in the implant group (hazard ratio [HR], 3.0; P = 0.0001; and HR, 3.8; P < 0.0001, respectively). In the implant group, most cataract surgery occurred within the first 2 years. Intraocular pressure elevation measures occurred more frequently in the implant group (HR range, 3.7-5.6; all P < 0.0001), and glaucoma (assessed annually) also occurred more frequently (26.3% vs. 10.2% by 48 months; HR, 3.0; P = 0.0002). In contrast, potential complications of systemic therapy, including measures of hypertension, hyperlipidemia, diabetes, bone disease, and hematologic and serum chemistry indicators of immunosuppression toxicity, did not differ between groups through 54 months. Indices of QoL initially favored implant therapy by a modest margin. However, all summary measures of health utility and vision-related or generic health-related QoL were minimally and nonsignificantly different by 54 months, with the exception of the 36-item Short-Form Health Survey physical component summary score, which favored implant by a small margin at 54 months (3.17 on a scale of 100; P = 0.01, not adjusted for multiple comparisons). Mean QoL results were favorable in both groups.
CONCLUSIONS: These results suggest that fluocinolone acetonide implant therapy is associated with a clinically important increased risk of glaucoma and cataract with respect to systemic therapy, suggesting that careful monitoring and early intervention to prevent glaucoma is warranted with implant therapy. Systemic therapy subjects avoided a significant excess of toxicities of systemic corticosteroid and immunosuppressive therapies in the trial. Self-reported QoL measures initially favored implant therapy, but over time the measures converged, with generally favorable QoL in both groups.",25,2015-Oct-1

To evaluate the results of tuberculin skin testing in Japanese patients with intraocular inflammation and to assess the outcome of treatment for presumed intraocular tuberculosis in selected patients.
DESIGN: Prospective, noncomparative, interventional case series.
PARTICIPANTS: One hundred twenty-six patients, newly referred to the Ocular Inflammation Service at the Kyorin Eye Center from April 1998 to August 2000, underwent systemic evaluation for the diagnosis and/or treatment of uveitis.
METHODS: Tuberculin skin testing with purified protein derivative was performed as part of the systemic evaluation. The diagnosis of presumed intraocular tuberculosis was made when findings were consistent with possible intraocular tuberculosis, the tuberculin skin test was positive (induration more than 10 mm), and no other cause of uveitis was suggested by symptoms, signs, or ancillary testing. Using these criteria, 10 patients were given a diagnosis of presumed intraocular tuberculosis and treated with antituberculosis therapy consisting of isoniazid, with or without rifampicin. Some of these patients also received a tapered course of oral corticosteroids after the initiation of antituberculosis treatment. None of the patients had any signs or symptoms of acquired immunodeficiency syndrome.
MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Visual acuity and ophthalmologic examination to assess degree of intraocular inflammation.
RESULTS: Twenty-six of the 126 patients (20.6%) had a positive tuberculin skin test result. Ten of these 26 patients (38.5%) were treated for a diagnosis of presumed intraocular tuberculosis. Nine patients had no evidence of pulmonary tuberculosis, and one patient had presumed tuberculous hilar lymphadenitis. The predominant clinical finding was choroidal or optic disc nodule in three patients, retinal vasculitis in three patients, and choroiditis in four patients. Nine patients exhibited decreased intraocular inflammation with treatment.
CONCLUSIONS: Roughly one fifth of the uveitis patients who underwent systemic evaluation had a positive tuberculin skin test result, and 9 of 10 selected skin test-positive patients with clinical findings consistent with intraocular tuberculosis had a favorable response to antituberculosis therapy. These results suggest that intraocular tuberculosis continues to be a major diagnostic consideration for uveitis patients in Japan.",25,2002-May-1

With improvements in molecular diagnostics tests, viruses are increasingly being found to be associated with what was previously described as idiopathic anterior uveitis. This review presents the clinical features of viral anterior uveitis.
RECENT FINDINGS: Herpes simplex virus/varicella zoster virus (HSV/VZV) are important causes of anterior uveitis, but other viruses including cytomegalovirus (CMV) and rubella are also found in a significant number of cases. The various viral anterior uveitides have similar features and should be suspected in eyes with diffuse, fine, stellate keratic precipitates, iris atrophy or ocular hypertension. Acyclovir remains the mainstay of therapy in HSV/VZV infections. CMV responds to ganciclovir, but the relapse rate is high and prolonged therapy may be required. Cataract and glaucoma are the main complications of viral anterior uveitis requiring appropriate management.
SUMMARY: There is considerable overlap between clinical manifestations of the different viral anterior uveitides as well noninfectious hypertensive anterior uveitis syndromes. Hence, corticosteroids should be used with caution in these eyes if virus diagnostic tests are not available.",25,2011-Nov-1

Uveitis is a leading cause of blindness affecting individuals of all ages, genders, and races. Uveitis may be due to autoimmune, infectious, toxic, malignant, or traumatic processes. Some evidence supports an association between conditions previously presumed to be autoimmune and viral infectious agents. For autoimmune uveitis, therapy is nonspecific, typically beginning with corticosteroids. For nonresponsive disease or for corticosteroid sparing, recent reports on mycophenolate mofetil, infliximab, and interferon therapy show success for various forms of uveitis. Treatment of the complications of uveitis, especially cystoid macular edema, is difficult. Vitamin E appears to offer little benefit, whereas octreotide may be effective. Recent collaborative efforts at standardization in the field should enhance studies on these conditions.",25,2006-Aug-1

To define uveitis associated with leptospirosis in a clinical setting.
METHODS: We present the clinical features of 73 consecutive cases of uveitis linked clinically to an outbreak of systemic leptospirosis in patients with antibodies to Leptospira species who were examined from January to September 1994.
RESULTS: In 73 patients, the pattern of ocular involvement was unilateral in 35 and bilateral in 38. Panuveitis was seen in 106 eyes (95.5%), retinal periphlebitis in 57 eyes (51.4%), and hypopyon in 14 eyes (12.6%). Anterior uveitis alone without hypopyon was observed in three eyes (2.7%), whereas vitreous inflammatory reaction alone was seen in two eyes (1.8%). Sixty of 73 patients (82.2%) or 91 of 111 eyes (82.0%) were followed up for 8 months. Final visual acuity was 6/6 (20/20) in 47 eyes (52%) and improved during treatment, although not up to 6/6, in 15 eyes (16%). Twenty-eight eyes (31%) maintained same vision, and one eye showed deterioration of vision.
CONCLUSION: Uveitis associated with leptospirosis may manifest as unilateral or bilateral uveitis, anterior uveitis, or panuveitis. The prognosis is generally good in this entity, even when the inflammation is severe. Awareness of this disease in endemic areas is important in order to differentiate it from other uveitic entities, especially in young male patients in whom other immunologic uveitides are also common.",25,1997-Jul-1

We determined the referral pattern and visual prognosis for patients with uveitis at a tertiary university eye center in the Midwestern U.S. over a five-year period. A retrospective chart review was conducted on 853 patients seen in the Department of Ophthalmology and Visual Sciences (DOVS) at Washington University and the Barnes Retina Institute (BRI) from 1990 to 1995. Recorded data on each patient included demographic information, anatomic diagnosis, etiologic diagnosis, pattern of uveitis, and best-corrected visual acuity (VA). Most patients originated from Missouri (65.3% [557/853]) and were Caucasian (88.4% [754/853]). There was an equal gender frequency (429 men, 424 women). The most frequent anatomic diagnosis was posterior uveitis (48.4% [414/853]), followed by anterior uveitis (22.3% [190/853]), panuveitis (18.4% [155/853]), and intermediate uveitis (10.9% [94/853]). An etiologic diagnosis was made in 69.3% (591/853) of the patients, with the most common diseases being cytomegalovirus (CMV) retinopathy, infectious endophthalmitis, pars planitis, multifocal choroiditis, and toxoplasmosis. The majority of uveitides presented with sudden onset (55.0% [469/853]) and lasted less than three months (51.9% [443/853]). A wide spectrum of uveitic disease is seen in a university eye center in the Midwest, including many cases with sudden-onset relatively short (<3 months) duration. The high frequency of posterior uveitis may be related to the appearance of newly recognized uveitic entities, such as multifocal choroiditis, birdshot retinochoroidopathy, and acute retinal necrosis.",25,2003-Dec-1

Sight threatening immune responses that damage the eye characterize intraocular inflammatory diseases. These diseases including uveitis and age-related macular degeneration are worryingly common and quality of life shattering. Genetic studies in past decades significantly advanced our understanding of the etiology of these devastating diseases. Unfortunately, patient genetics alone failed to adequately explain disease origin, susceptibility, and progression. Non-genetic factors such as the epigenetic regulation of ocular diseases and the environmental factors triggering intraocular inflammation offer new insight into intraocular inflammatory disorders. Importantly, mounting evidence is signaling that dysbiosis of human microbiota leads to rapid epigenomic reprograming of host cells and results in the onset of many diseases. In this review, we discuss how epigenetic mechanisms and microbiota may cooperate to initiate and perpetuate ocular inflammation. Lastly, we propose that the discovery of intraocular microbiota presents a significant shift in thought affecting current approaches to the diagnosis, treatment, and prevention of intraocular inflammatory diseases such as uveitis and age-related macular degeneration. The geographical and genetic background difference in both disease presentation and genetic association of intraocular inflammatory diseases may be due to the variation of intraocular microbiota.",25,2018-May-1

To determine the association between cystoid macular edema and vascular endothelial growth factor concentration in the aqueous humor and plasma of uveitis patients.
METHODS: Cross-sectional study. Vascular endothelial growth factor concentrations were measured by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay in the aqueous humor of 20 uveitis patients (9 with and 11 without cystoid macular edema), and in the plasma of 40 uveitis patients (20 with and 20 without cystoid macular edema) and 20 healthy volunteers.
RESULTS: Mean aqueous humor vascular endothelial growth factor concentrations for uveitis patients with and without cystoid macular edema were 152.3 and 109.5 pg/ml, respectively, P =.044. Mean plasma vascular endothelial growth factor concentrations in uveitis patients with and without cystoid macular edema and in healthy volunteers were 32.2, 29.6, and 55.0 pg/ml, respectively. Uveitis patients had lower plasma vascular endothelial growth factor levels than did healthy volunteers, P =.0002.
CONCLUSION: In uveitis patients, vascular endothelial growth factor concentration is increased in the aqueous humor of eyes with cystoid macular edema. It may be useful to investigate vascular endothelial growth factor antagonists as a treatment for uveitis-associated cystoid macular edema.",25,2001-Nov-1

Ocular inflammation causes significant visual morbidity in the United States, yet little is known about the epidemiology of infectious uveitis and scleritis. This study aims to evaluate the epidemiology of infectious uveitis/scleritis employing a large national medical claims database.
METHODS: This was a retrospective, case-control study, employing Optum's de-identified Clinformatics® Data Mart Database, containing data from 21.5 million privately insured individuals with enrollment for at least 15 months within 2007-2015. Inclusion in the uveitis/scleritis sample required an index uveitis/scleritis diagnosis based on International Classification of Diseases, Ninth Revision (ICD-9) codes. Exclusion criteria included index date within 3 months after intraocular surgery. Rates for uveitis/scleritis were determined by anatomic site. Multivariable logistic regression analyses were performed to determine odds ratios for the incidence and prevalence of uveitis/scleritis by anatomic category.
FINDINGS: Infectious etiologies accounted for less than 20% of uveitis/scleritis, with mean rates of 18.9 (incidence) and 60.6 (prevalence) per 100,000 persons. The mean prevalences of infectious anterior, intermediate, posterior, panuveitis, and scleritis were 27.7, 0.17, 23.4, 4.4, and 4.6, per 100,000, respectively. Overall risk of prevalent infectious uveitis/scleritis increased with age (OR>3.3 for each decade over age 18, p<0.01), female sex (OR = 1.2, p<0.01), non-Hispanic white race (OR<1 for all other races, p<0.01), as well as the East South Central census division (OR = 1.2, p<0.01), comprising Alabama, Kentucky, Missouri, and Tennessee. Medical comorbidities, including HIV infection (OR = 6.4, p<0.01) and rheumatologic disease (OR = 1.9, p<0.01), were common in the infectious uveitis/scleritis cohort.
CONCLUSIONS: The incidence and prevalence of infectious uveitis/scleritis in the United States were higher than previously reported estimates but remained lower than in developing countries. Rates varied by age, sex, race, and medical comorbidities, and may reflect differential susceptibility to various infectious agents with disparate geographic distributions within the United States.",25,2020-1-1

To determine the efficacy of sirolimus in the treatment of patients with severe non-infectious uveitis.
METHODS: Eight patients with severe non-infectious uveitis were recruited to an open study. Inclusion criteria were limited to patients whose disease was not controlled with at least two or more separate steroid sparing immunosuppressants (either because of unacceptable side effects or ineffectiveness of the drug) or who required regular doses of corticosteroids either as high dose systemic or orbital floor injections in order to control their disease. Intraocular inflammation, visual acuity, symptoms, corticosteroid burden, drug toxicity, and side effects were monitored.
RESULTS: Sirolimus therapy was effective in five of the eight patients, all of whom had their dose of corticosteroids reduced or discontinued. Treatment in three patients was considered a failure as it caused intolerable side effects and/or failed to control the uveitis. Side effects were common and were typically gastrointestinal or cutaneous in nature. The severity of symptoms was dose dependent in most cases and occurred at trough blood levels above 25 ng/ml.
CONCLUSION: Sirolimus is an effective and potent immunosuppressive treatment in the majority of patients with non-infectious uveitis and can reduce the need for long term supplementary corticosteroid therapy. Further studies are required to establish the long term efficacy and safety of sirolimus alone or in combination with other steroid sparing immunosuppressants.",25,2005-Jun-1

Equine recurrent uveitis (ERU) is an autoimmune disease that occurs with a high prevalence (10%) in horses. ERU represents the only reliable spontaneous model for human autoimmune uveitis. We already identified and characterized novel autoantigens (malate dehydrogenase, recoverin, CRALBP) by analyzing the autoantibody-binding pattern of horses affected by spontaneous recurrent uveitis (ERU) to the retinal proteome. CRALBP also seems to be relevant to human autoimmune uveitis. Proteomic screening of vitreous and retinal samples from ERU diseased cases in comparison to healthy controls has led to the identification of a series of differentially regulated proteins, which are functionally linked to the immune system and the maintenance of the blood-retinal barrier.",25,2008-1-1

RESULTS: Mean retinal thickness at the central fovea was 357 (SD 128) microm. The mean VA was 0.5 (logMAR). There was agreement between OCT and FA in 112 eyes (86.8%). In eight eyes (6.2%), serous retinal detachment (SRD) was detected on OCT but not on FA. Nine eyes (7%) had perifoveal leakage on FA without macular thickening on OCT. There were three patterns of macular oedema on OCT: diffuse macular oedema (DMO), cystoid macular oedema (CMO) and SRD. CMO was detected in 61 eyes (50.8%), and in 18 of these eyes (15%), CMO was associated with SRD. DMO was detected in 45 eyes (37.5%), and in eight (6.7%) of these eyes, DMO was associated with SRD. SRD without retinal thickening was present in 14 eyes (11%). Epiretinal membrane was detected by OCT in 27 eyes (21%). Six eyes demonstrated vitreomacular traction (4.7%). There was a correlation between VA and central thickness on OCT (r = 0.407, p = 0.000001). Correlation between VA and central thickness is significant in the group with CMO (r = 0.401, p = 0.001) but not significant in the group with DMO. Furthermore, vision recovery was observed in patients with CMO but was limited in patients with DMO. SRD did not have a significant impact on visual recovery, but its presence reduced the correlation between vision and central thickness.
CONCLUSION: OCT is effective in detection of macular oedema. It allows determination of the distribution of fluid and quantification of retinal thickness particularly in patients with CMO. In these patients, a potential for vision recovery was also identified. DMO was associated with a poor visual prognosis and a poor prognosis for vision recovery. SRD is associated with a high probability of vision recovery when observed alone or underlying CMO eyes. It should be substracted from the central thickness measurement when attempting to correlate central thickness with vision in patients with macular oedema in uveitis.",25,2008-Jul-1

To determine whether demographic, clinical, and laboratory variables at onset of arthritis can predict the development and the severity of anterior uveitis (AU) in oligoarticular juvenile idiopathic arthritis (JIA).
METHODS: In a retrospective study, a cohort of 366 patients with oligoarticular onset JIA from 3 pediatric rheumatology centers were evaluated. Patients were classified in 3 groups: severe uveitis (SU) with a mean >/= 2 uveitis relapses/year with complications or need for immunosuppressive therapy; mild uveitis (MU) with a mean </= 1 uveitis relapse/year with no complications; and no uveitis. Variables that were significant with univariate tests or were clinically relevant for each outcome underwent multivariate logistic regression analysis.
RESULTS: There were 316 patients available for analyses: 66 in the SU group, 64 in the MU group, and 186 in the no uveitis group. Multivariate analysis showed the following factors to be significant as predictors of AU onset: low age at onset (OR 0.96), a2-globulin plasma concentration (OR 1.34), and HLA-A19 (OR 2.87), B22 (OR 4.51) and DR9 (OR 2.33), while HLA-DR1 conferred protection (OR 0.13). This model was not good in predicting which patient would develop uveitis (sensitivity 55%, specificity 26%). Time interval between onset of arthritis and the first AU and elevated a2-globulin level in the serum were the best predictors of AU severity (OR 1.62 and 0.85, respectively). When applied prospectively, the model revealed good sensitivity (89.2%), specificity (76.1%), and efficiency (86.3%).
CONCLUSION: Clinical and laboratory variables measurable at onset of arthritis can be used to predict severity of the course of AU in oligoarticular JIA, but not its onset. More accurate prediction can shorten or lengthen the intervals between ophthalmologic evaluations and can change the therapeutic approach undertaken on the basis of expected disease severity.",25,2002-Nov-1

To determine prevalence and complications of juvenile idiopathic arthritis (JIA)-associated uveitis, and to evaluate risk factors for uveitis and its relation to articular disease.
METHODS: Records of 309 patients with JIA (244 female, 65 male, mean age at onset 4.9 yrs) were retrospectively reviewed. Occurrence of uveitis and complications were assessed among oligoarticular-onset JIA (193 patients), polyarticular-onset JIA (66 patients), and systemic-onset JIA (50 patients). The presence of antinuclear antibodies (ANA) was determined in patients with oligoarticular-onset JIA. Therapy and relapses of uveitis and arthritis were recorded at each visit during the followup (mean followup 7.6 yrs).
RESULTS: Sixty-two patients developed uveitis (20.1%); 57 patients had oligoarticular-, 3 polyarticular-, and 2 systemic-onset JIA. Uveitis was asymptomatic in 56/62 cases. Fifty-five of the 62 patients (88.7%) developed uveitis within 4 years from disease onset. In patients with oligoarticular-onset JIA, an early age at disease onset and the presence of ANA (p < 0.05) and DRB1*11 (p < 0.03) were the best predictors of uveitis, while a polyarticular course was not associated to uveitis (p > 0.05). Active arthritis was present at the first episode of uveitis in 46/62 patients. Forty-four of the 62 patients experienced relapses of uveitis: in 20/62, relapses were concomitant to arthritis relapses; in 24/62 relapses presented without active arthritis. Complications of uveitis developed in 35.5% of the patients (22/62), leading to visual impairment in 13 patients.
CONCLUSION: Current guidelines provide early identification of uveitis in 90% of patients. With the exception of the first episode of uveitis, uveitis and arthritis seem to run different courses; close ophthalmologic scrutiny then should also be maintained during arthritis remission.",25,2007-May-1

To determine whether the levels of cytokines and chemokines in tears differ in uveitis patients and healthy subjects.
METHODS: Ninety-two uveitis patients (mean age 46.4 years) and 157 control healthy subjects (mean age 49.5 years) were recruited. Subjects with ocular surface diseases such as dry eye were excluded from the study. Using multiplex bead-based assays, tears (4 μl) were analysed for the concentration of interleukin (IL)-1β, IL-1RA, IL-2, IL-6, IL-7, IL-8/CXCL8, IL-10, IL-12p70, IL-15, IL-17A, IL-23, epidermal growth factor (EGF), fractalkine/CX3CL1, interferon-γ, IP-10/CXCL10, monocyte chemo-attractant protein (MCP)-1/CCL2, tumour necrosis factor-α, vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF), transforming growth factor (TGF)-β1, TGF-β2 and TGF-β3. Tear molecule levels were compared between the groups and among the different forms of uveitis and disease severity.
RESULTS: Epidermal growth factor, IL-1RA, IL-7, IL-8/CXCL8, IP-10/CXCL10, MCP-1/CCL2, TGF-β2 and VEGF were detected in more than 75% of the samples in both groups. Statistically significant differences in percentage of detection between control and patient groups were found for IL-23, IL-1β, IL-15, EGF, fractalkine/CX3CL1 and MCP-1/CCL2. The concentrations of IL-1RA, IL-8/CXCL8, fractalkine/CX3CL1, IP-10/CXCL10, VEGF and TGF-β2 in uveitis tear samples were elevated compared to controls (p < 0.05). Significant differences in tear levels of those molecules and also EGF were also present depending on the anatomic classification of uveitis.
CONCLUSION: There were significant differences in the levels of several cytokines and chemokines in tears of patients with uveitis compared with healthy subjects. These results can help understand the underlying pathophysiology of the uveitis and could potentially aid in diagnosis.",25,2017-Aug-1

To study the amelioration of ocular inflammation in endotoxin-induced uveitis (EIU) in rats by benfotiamine, a lipid-soluble analogue of thiamine.
METHODS: EIU in Lewis rats was induced by subcutaneous injection of lipopolysaccharide (LPS) followed by treatment with benfotiamine. The rats were killed 3 or 24 hours after LPS injection, eyes were enucleated, aqueous humor (AqH) was collected, and the number of infiltrating cells, protein concentration, and inflammatory marker levels were determined. Immunohistochemical analysis of eye sections was performed to determine the expression of inducible-nitric oxide synthase (iNOS), cyclooxygenase (Cox)-2, protein kinase C (PKC), and transcription factor NF-kappaB.
RESULTS: Infiltrating leukocytes, protein concentrations, and inflammatory cytokines and chemokines were significantly elevated in the AqH of EIU rats compared with control rats, and benfotiamine treatment suppressed these increases. Similarly increased expression of inflammatory markers iNOS and Cox-2 in ciliary body and retinal wall was also significantly inhibited by benfotiamine. The increased phosphorylation of PKC and the activation of NF-kappaB in the ciliary body and in the retinal wall of EIU rat eyes were suppressed by benfotiamine.
CONCLUSIONS: These results suggest that benfotiamine suppresses oxidative stress-induced NF-kappaB-dependent inflammatory signaling leading to uveitis. Therefore, benfotiamine could be used as a novel therapeutic agent for the treatment of ocular inflammation, especially uveitis.",25,2009-May-1

To observe the expression of Toll-like receptor-4 (TLR4), myeloid differentiation factor 88 (MyD88), and nuclear factor kappa B p65 (NF-κB p65) in iris tissue during endotoxin-induced uveitis (EIU) and evaluate the significance of these factors in uveitis.
METHODS: Wistar rats were randomly divided into 5 groups (0  h, 12  h, 24  h, 48  h, and 72  h, n = 10/group). Animal model of acute anterior uveitis was established by a hind footpad injection of 200  μg Cholera vibrio LPS. Expression of TLR4, MyD88, and NF-κB p65 in iris ciliary body tissue was detected through immunohistochemical staining.
RESULTS: Expression of TLR4 was not detected in normal iris-ciliary body complex, TLR4 positive cells with round morphology appeared in the iris stroma 12 hours after injection, significantly increased (P < .001) 48 hours after injection, and decreased gradually 72 hours after injection. Expression of MyD88 and NF-κB p65 is consistent with the change of the TLR4.
CONCLUSIONS: The increased expression of TLR4 and its downstream signal transduction moleculesMyD88, NF-κB p65 indicate the potential role of pathway in the pathogenesis of acute anterior uveitis (AAU).",25,2010-1-1

To develop classification criteria for 25 of the most common uveitides.
DESIGN: Machine learning using 5,766 cases of 25 uveitides.
METHODS: Cases were collected in an informatics-designed preliminary database. Using formal consensus techniques, a final database was constructed of 4,046 cases achieving supermajority agreement on the diagnosis. Cases were analyzed within uveitic class and were split into a training set and a validation set. Machine learning used multinomial logistic regression with lasso regularization on the training set to determine a parsimonious set of criteria for each disease and to minimize misclassification rates. The resulting criteria were evaluated in the validation set. Accuracy of the rules developed to express the machine learning criteria was evaluated by a masked observer in a 10% random sample of cases.
RESULTS: Overall accuracy estimates by uveitic class in the validation set were as follows: anterior uveitides 96.7% (95% confidence interval [CI] 92.4, 98.6); intermediate uveitides 99.3% (95% CI 96.1, 99.9); posterior uveitides 98.0% (95% CI 94.3, 99.3); panuveitides 94.0% (95% CI 89.0, 96.8); and infectious posterior uveitides / panuveitides 93.3% (95% CI 89.1, 96.3). Accuracies of the masked evaluation of the ""rules"" were anterior uveitides 96.5% (95% CI 91.4, 98.6) intermediate uveitides 98.4% (91.5, 99.7), posterior uveitides 99.2% (95% CI 95.4, 99.9), panuveitides 98.9% (95% CI 94.3, 99.8), and infectious posterior uveitides / panuveitides 98.8% (95% CI 93.4, 99.9).
CONCLUSIONS: The classification criteria for these 25 uveitides had high overall accuracy (ie, low misclassification rates) and seemed to perform well enough for use in clinical and translational research.",24,2021-Aug-1

The blockbuster drug paradigm is under increasing scrutiny across the biopharmaceutical industry. Intraocular inflammation poses particular challenges to this, given the heterogeneity of conditions in the uveitis spectrum, and the increasing acknowledgement of individual patient and disease variance in underlying immune responses. This need has triggered a drive towards personalised and stratified medicine, supported and enabled as a result of continued development of both experimental models and molecular biological techniques and improved clinical classification. As such we have the ability now to systematically appraise at a genomic, transcriptomic, and proteomic level individual immunophenotype, and the promise that in the eye this can be augmented by in vivo immune imaging to identify individual immunopathology. With such advances all running in parallel, we are entering an era of experimental medicine that will facilitate early diagnosis, generate biomarkers for accurate prognostication, and enable the development of individualised and targeted therapies, which can progress rapidly into clinical practice.",24,2012-Jan-1

An EAU model has been developed in the mouse using the retinal soluble antigen (SAg), and the interphotoreceptor retinoid-binding protein (IRBP). Immunogenetic studies indicate that sensitivity to disease is H-2 dependent, but some data suggest that non-MHC genes may also contribute to the regulation of EAU. IRBP was a more potent uveitogen than SAg. Ability to mount lymphocyte and antibody responses was exhibited both by EAU-susceptible and by EAU-resistant strains, and could not be used as a predictive parameter. Dependence of disease induction on variables of immunization was studied in B10.A mice (I-Ak) immunized with IRBP. Use of Bordetella pertussis as additional adjuvant was a prerequisite for successful disease induction. Use of purified pertussis toxin (PTX), rather than a suspension of pertussis bacteria, allowed reduction of the immunization protocol to a single dose of IRBP in CFA. Severity and incidence of disease, as well as its clinical course, were directly affected by the dose of antigen and PTX, and could be controlled by varying their respective doses. A spectrum of disease, from hyperacute to chronic, could be obtained. The chronic type of EAU tended to relapse, with lesions reappearing after a brief period of essential quiescence. The special advantages of the murine EAU model for the study of ocular autoimmunity are discussed.",24,1990-1-1

The purpose of this work was to improve the efficacy of triamcinolone acetonide (TA) in the treatment of endotoxin-induced uveitis (EIU) using a polymeric nanoparticulate drug delivery system. Poly(D,L-lactide-co-glycolide) (PLGA) nanoparticles were prepared using a modified emulsification/solvent diffusion method. Processing factors affecting loading and size were also studied. After physicochemical studies including in vitro release, X-ray powder diffraction, differential scanning calorimetry, and scanning electron microscopy, in vivo studies were conducted using nanoparticles sized 195 nm with 3.16% drug loading. Inflammatory factors such as flare, cell, and fibrin were studied in rabbit's eye over 96 h period, using laser flare meter and slit lamp examination. Inflammatory mediators such as NO, PGE2, cell, and protein were measured quantitatively 36 h after intravitreal injection of endotoxin in aqueous humor, and the therapeutic effects were compared in different groups. Results indicated statistically significant differences between the effect of nanoparticles in the treatment of EIU compared to microparticles of TA and prednisolone acetate (PA). There were no significant differences between the effects of TA injection and TA nanoparticles. In conclusion, sustain release biodegradable TA nanoparticles are potential new topical treatment options which can provide better patient compliance.",24,2013-May-1

To characterize the clinical features of Chinese patients with Fuchs' syndrome.
DESIGN: Retrospective noncomparative case series.
PARTICIPANTS: One hundred eighteen eyes of 104 consecutive patients with Fuchs' syndrome initially examined between January 1999 and March 2005.
METHODS: The history and clinical findings of all consecutive Fuchs' patients attending the Zhongshan Ophthalmic Center were reviewed. Auxiliary examinations, including laser flare-cell photometry, ultrasound biomicroscopy (UBM), fundus fluorescein angiography (FFA), and serologic tests for Toxoplasma gondii, were performed in certain cases.
MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Patients' demographics, clinical presentation, and auxiliary examination findings.
RESULTS: One hundred four patients (49 male, 55 female) were included in this study. Unilateral involvement was noted in 90 patients (86.5%). The most common symptom was blurred or decreased vision (86%). Stellate and medium-sized keratic precipitates (KPs) were noted in 108 eyes (91.5%). A mild anterior chamber (AC) reaction was observed in all the affected eyes. Heterochromia was observed in only 15 affected eyes, although there were varying degrees of iris depigmentation in all patients. Iris nodules, mostly Koeppe, were present in 28.0% of the affected eyes. Complicated cataract, vitreous opacity, and secondary glaucoma were observed in 84 of 118 eyes (70.7%), 31 eyes of 42 eyes (73.8%), and 24 of 118 eyes (23.1%), respectively. The mean laser flare photometry value (6.4+/-2.3 photon counts per millisecond) and the cell number in the AC (1.5+/-1.2 cells per 0.5 mm3) in 25 patients were both significantly higher than those in 25 healthy controls (5.3+/-2.3 photon counts per millisecond and 0.8+/-0.6 cells per 0.5 mm3) (P<0.05). Ultrasound biomicroscopy revealed exudates adjacent to the ciliary body in 18 of 24 patients (75%). Serological tests failed to confirm an association of Fuchs' syndrome with toxoplasmosis. Retinal capillary leakage in the midperipheral fundus and disc staining at the late stage were observed in most of the eyes examined by FFA.
CONCLUSION: Fuchs' syndrome in Chinese patients is characterized by a mild uveitis with characteristic KPs, varying degrees of iris depigmentation, and, occasionally, heterochromia. Exudates adjacent to the ciliary body and subclinical retinal and optic nerve involvement were common in the patients who were studied by UBM and FFA.",24,2006-Mar-1

Current understanding of the role of oxidative stress in ocular inflammatory diseases indicates that antioxidant therapy may be important to optimize the treatment. Recently investigated antioxidant therapies for ocular inflammatory diseases include various vitamins, plant products and reactive oxygen species scavengers. Oxidative stress plays a causative role in both non-infectious and infectious uveitis complications, and novel strategies to diminish tissue damage and dysfunction with antioxidant therapy may ameliorate visual complications. Preclinical studies with experimental animals and cultured cells demonstrate significant anti-inflammatory effects of a number of promising antioxidant agents. Many of these antioxidants are under clinical trial for various inflammatory diseases other than uveitis such as cardiovascular, rheumatoid arthritis and cancer. Well planned interventional clinical studies in the field of ocular inflammation will be necessary to sufficiently investigate the potential medical benefits of antioxidant therapies for uveitis. This review summarizes the recent investigations of novel antioxidant agents for ocular inflammation, with selected studies focused on uveitis.",24,2011-1-1

Uveitis causes blindness and critical visual impairment in people of all ages, and retinal microglia participate in uveitis progression. Unfortunately, effective treatment is deficient. Icariin (ICA) is a bioactive monomer derived from Epimedium. However, the role of ICA in uveitis remains elusive. Our study indicated that ICA alleviated intraocular inflammation in vivo. Further results showed the proinflammatory M1 microglia could be transferred to anti-inflammatory M2 microglia by ICA in the retina and HMC3 cells. However, the direct pharmacological target of ICA is unknown, to this end, proteome microarrays and molecular simulations were used to identify the molecular targets of ICA. Data showed that ICA binds to peroxiredoxin-3 (PRDX3), increasing PRDX3 protein expression in both a time- and a concentration-dependent manner and promoting the subsequent elimination of H",24,2022-Jun-1

To evaluate retrospectively the long-term efficacy of rituximab in patients with severe juvenile idiopathic arthritis (JIA)-associated uveitis.
METHODS: Eight patients (15 eyes) with severe and longstanding JIA uveitis, who had an inadequate response in controlling uveitis to one or more biologic agents including tumour necrosis factor blockers and abatacept, received rituximab therapy. Rituximab was given at a dose of 1000 mg per infusion on days 1 and 15 and then every 6 months. Clinical responses to treatment, including decrease in uveitis activity, visual acuity changes, reduction of concomitant local and systemic corticosteroid and/or immunosuppressants, and occurrence of adverse events, were assessed.
RESULTS: Eight patients with a mean±SD age of 22.8±5.5 years were treated. The mean ocular disease duration was 17.7 years; the mean±SD follow-up time on rituximab was 44.75±4.9 months; and the mean number of rituximab infusions received was 8.75 (range 6-12). All patients achieved complete control of uveitis, but in two patients rituximab was discontinued due to inefficacy in treating arthritis. The decrease in uveitis activity was evident 4-5 months after the first infusion. Systemic corticosteroids and immunosuppressants used in association with rituximab were discontinued in five patients at the end of follow-up. None of the patients experienced visual worsening during the follow-up. No drug-related complications were encountered.
CONCLUSIONS: Rituximab may be a promising effective treatment option for refractory uveitis associated with JIA leading to long-term quiescence of uveitis, particularly for patients who have not previously responded to other biologic therapies.",24,2016-Jun-1

To investigate the epidemiology of uveitis in Japan and assess its changes over time.
STUDY DESIGN: Retrospective multicenter study METHODS: Sixty-six hospitals in Japan with uveitis specialty clinics participated in this retrospective nationwide survey. A questionnaire was sent to each hospital to survey the total number of patients who made a first visit to the outpatient uveitis clinic of each hospital between 1 April 2016 and 31 March 2017. The diagnosis of uveitis was based on guidelines when available or on commonly used diagnostic criteria.
RESULTS: In 2016, new patients with uveitis accounted for 3.2% of the total number of new patients with ophthalmic diseases. A total of 5378 patients were enrolled in the survey; 3408 cases could be classified with a specific uveitis entity, and 1970 cases were described as unclassified intraocular inflammation. Among the classified cases, the most frequent disease was sarcoidosis (10.6%), followed by Vogt-Koyanagi-Harada disease (8.1%), herpetic iritis (6.5%), acute anterior uveitis (5.5%), sclerouveitis (4.4%), Behçet's disease (4.2%), malignant disease (2.6%), acute retinal necrosis (1.7%), Posner-Schlossman syndrome (1.7%), and diabetic iritis (1.4%). The rates of sarcoidosis, Vogt-Koyanagi-Harada disease, and Behçet's disease were similar; however, the rate of herpes iritis increased (4.2-6.5%) when compared with the 2009 survey.
CONCLUSIONS: Some changes were observed between the previous nationwide surveys (2002 and 2009) and the present survey. It must be valuable to continue such nationwide epidemiologic surveys at regular intervals.",24,2021-Mar-1

Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is a highly infectious and pathogenic respiratory disease. To date, there is no effective treatment, and there is an urgent need to develop vaccines against the virus. Five coronavirus COVID-19 vaccines have been approved for inoculation in China, with good safety and few adverse reactions.
CASE PRESENTATION: A 50-year-old woman complained of bilateral blurred vision and visual distortion 5 days after vaccination with the inactivated COVID-19 vaccine. Physical and auxiliary examination showed that she developed bilateral posterior uveitis. The patient was administered local and systemic steroids, and the symptoms were appreciably improved 5 weeks later.
CONCLUSIONS: A case of bilateral uveitis after COVID-19 vaccination was reported and indicated that uveitis after vaccination appears transient and responds well to steroids.",24,2021-Dec-1

To evaluate agreement between fluorescein angiography (FA) and optical coherence tomography (OCT) results for diagnosis of macular edema in patients with uveitis.
DESIGN: Multicenter cross-sectional study.
PARTICIPANTS: Four hundred seventy-nine eyes with uveitis from 255 patients.
METHODS: The macular status of dilated eyes with intermediate uveitis, posterior uveitis, or panuveitis was assessed via Stratus-3 OCT and FA. To evaluate agreement between the diagnostic approaches, κ statistics were used.
MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Macular thickening (MT; center point thickness, ≥ 240 μm per reading center grading of OCT images) and macular leakage (ML; central subfield fluorescein leakage, ≥ 0.44 disc areas per reading center grading of FA images), and agreement between these outcomes in diagnosing macular edema.
RESULTS: Optical coherence tomography (90.4%) more frequently returned usable information regarding macular edema than FA (77%) or biomicroscopy (76%). Agreement in diagnosis of MT and ML (κ = 0.44) was moderate. Macular leakage was present in 40% of cases free of MT, whereas MT was present in 34% of cases without ML. Biomicroscopic evaluation for macular edema failed to detect 40% and 45% of cases of MT and ML, respectively, and diagnosed 17% and 17% of cases with macular edema that did not have MT or ML, respectively; these results may underestimate biomicroscopic errors (ophthalmologists were not explicitly masked to OCT and FA results). Among eyes free of ML, phakic eyes without cataract rarely (4%) had MT. No factors were found that effectively ruled out ML when MT was absent.
CONCLUSIONS: Optical coherence tomography and FA offered only moderate agreement regarding macular edema status in uveitis cases, probably because what they measure (MT and ML) are related but nonidentical macular pathologic characteristics. Given its lower cost, greater safety, and greater likelihood of obtaining usable information, OCT may be the best initial test for evaluation of suspected macular edema. However, given that ML cannot be ruled out if MT is absent and vice versa, obtaining the second test after negative results on the first seems justified when detection of ML or MT would alter management. Given that biomicroscopic evaluation for macular edema erred frequently, ancillary testing for macular edema seems indicated when knowledge of ML or MT status would affect management.

To present the clinical presentation, diagnosis, and management of syphilitic uveitis in the context of an epidemic of syphilis in the UK.
METHOD: Retrospective clinical case series.
RESULTS: Six new cases of syphilitic uveitis presented to the Manchester Uveitis Clinic in 2004, after a 15-fold increase in the incidence of syphilis in the UK, including 615 cases in Greater Manchester in the 5 years to 2004. Four cases had secondary syphilis, two had latent disease, two had no rash, and two were HIV positive. Ocular involvement included anterior or panuveitis, retinitis, retinal vasculitis, and papillitis. All resolved on treatment including intramuscular procaine penicillin G with oral probenecid.
CONCLUSIONS: Syphilis is much more common recently and syphilitic uveitis should be considered in all patients with rash and/or headache, where there is retinitis and/or retinal vasculitis, or in any uveitis of uncertain origin. Treatment is that of neurosyphilis.",24,2006-Jun-1

Review current literature relevant to syphilitic uveitis utilizing Medline search and online governmental resources relevant to the diagnosis and management of syphilis presenting with ocular manifestations.
RECENT FINDINGS: There is a trend for increasing frequency of primary and secondary syphilis in developed countries, especially in young men. Ocular manifestations of syphilis are rare, occurring in less than one in 1 million persons in the United Kingdom. Distinctive patterns of syphilitic uveitis include white, focal preretinal opacities, and acute posterior placoid uveitis. Enhanced imaging can facilitate clinical diagnosis. Definitive diagnosis remains serologic. The Centers for Disease Control currently recommends reverse sequence testing with initial treponemal antibodies, followed by a quantitative nontreponemal test, which, if negative, triggers a confirmatory treponemal pallidum agglutination test. Persons testing positive for syphilis should also be tested for HIV. Recommendations of the Centers for Disease Control for treatment are unchanged: all ocular syphilis should be treated according to neurosyphilis regimens and should receive cerebrospinal fluid testing.
SUMMARY: Increased case numbers of syphilitic uveitis have stimulated interest in this old disease. This locally destructive ocular inflammation with the potential for severe systemic complications is curable with treatment and should have the highest priority for prompt recognition and treatment.",24,2014-Nov-1

Experimental autoimmune uveoretinitis (EAU) in animals is a T cell-mediated autoimmune response directed against cells of the neural retina, in particular the photoreceptors. EAU can be induced in susceptible strains of mice by immunization with purified retinal Ag, and serves as a model for human uveitis. Because strong HLA associations have been noted in a number of human uveitic diseases, we investigated the role of MHC vs non-MHC genes in the control of susceptibility to ocular autoimmunity using the mouse EAU model. Selected strains representing most of the known independent H-2 haplotypes, as well as several H-2-recombinant and congenic strains, were immunized with interphotoreceptor retinoid-binding protein. Ocular pathology was induced in strains of the H-2k haplotype and their I-A-matched congenics, as well as in strains of the H-2r, H-2b, and H-2d haplotypes. In a series of experiments utilizing intra-H-2 recombinant strains, MHC control of susceptibility was tentatively mapped to the I-A subregion of the H-2k. Expression of the I-Ek gene product was not required for susceptibility to EAU, and in fact appeared to have an ameliorating effect on disease. Incidence and severity of disease obtained in strains sharing the same H-2 on a different background, or sharing the same background in the context of a different H-2, indicated that non-MHC genes contribute significantly to the regulation of EAU. Disease expression of susceptible H-2 haplotypes was highest in strains with B10 background (permissive) and ranged from intermediate to absent in strains with other (nonpermissive) backgrounds. The data suggest that although the ability to develop ocular pathology is dependent on the I-A subregion of the H-2, the final expression of disease in susceptible haplotypes is largely determined by background, non-MHC genes.",24,1992-Apr-15

To determine the association between tobacco smoking history and uveitis.
DESIGN: Retrospective, case-control study.
PARTICIPANTS: A total of 564 patients with ocular inflammation seen in the Proctor Foundation uveitis clinic between 2002 and 2009, and 564 randomly selected patients seen in the comprehensive eye clinic within the same time period.
METHODS: A retrospective medical record review of all cases and controls.
MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: A logistic regression analysis was conducted with ocular inflammation as the main outcome variable and smoking as the main predictor variable, while adjusting for age, gender, race, and median income.
RESULTS: The odds of a smoker having ocular inflammation were 2.2-fold that of a patient who had never smoked (95% confidence interval [CI], 1.7-3.0; P<0.001). All anatomic subtypes of uveitis were associated with a positive smoking history, with odds ratios (ORs) of 1.7 (95% CI, 1.2-2.4; P = 0.002) for anterior uveitis, 2.7 (95% CI, 1.4-5.6; P = 0.005) for intermediate uveitis, 3.2 (95% CI, 1.3-7.9; P = 0.014) for posterior uveitis, and 3.9 (95% CI, 2.4-6.1; P<0.001) for panuveitis. In patients with panuveitis and cystoid macular edema (CME), the OR was 8.0 (95% CI, 3.3-19.5; P<0.001) compared with 3.1 (95% CI, 1.8-5.2; P<0.001) for patients without CME. Patients with intermediate uveitis and CME also had a higher OR (OR 8.4; 95% CI, 2.5-28.8; P = 0.001) compared with patients without CME (OR 1.5; 95% CI, 0.6-3.8; P = 0.342). Patients with a smoking history were at greater odds of having infectious uveitis (OR 4.5; 95% CI, 2.3-9.0; P<0.001) than noninfectious uveitis (OR 2.1; 95% CI, 1.6-2.8; P<0.001), although both were associated with smoking.
CONCLUSIONS: A history of smoking is significantly associated with all anatomic subtypes of uveitis and infectious uveitis. The association was greater in patients with intermediate uveitis and panuveitis with CME compared with those without CME. In view of the known risks of smoking, these findings, if replicated, would give an additional reason to recommend smoking cessation in patients with uveitis.",24,2010-Mar-1

Cataract is an important source of visual loss in patients with uveitis. Whether or not outcomes of cataract surgery in eyes with uveitis are worse compared with non-uveitic eyes have to date been compromised by lack of reliable estimates of benefit and harm, which require data from large cohorts.
METHODS: Electronic medical record data were extracted from eight independent UK clinical sites for eyes undergoing cataract extraction between January 2010 and December 2014. 1173 eyes with a recorded diagnosis of uveitis were compared with a reference group of 95 573 eyes from the same dataset.
RESULTS: Uveitic eyes represented 1.2% of all eyes undergoing cataract surgery. Eyes in the uveitic group had worse preoperative visual acuity (0.87 vs 0.65 logarithm of the minimum angle of resolution (logMAR) units), were from younger patients and had shorter axial lengths and a higher incidence of ocular copathology including glaucoma. A greater number had documented small pupils, required additional surgical procedures, developed more intraoperative complications and had poorer postoperative visual acuity at all time points measured up to 6 months (0.41 vs 0.27 logMAR units at 12-24 weeks).
CONCLUSIONS: This large study cohort of eyes with a diagnosis of uveitis undergoing cataract surgery highlights more precisely the complex surgical demands, copathology and worse visual outcomes in this group. These data will allow more accurate preoperative counselling and planning. Although improvement in visual acuity is achieved in most cases, prognosis should be guarded, so that patient expectations are met. Compared with the non-uveitic population, the mean postoperative visual acuity is between one and two lines worse at all time points.",24,2017-Aug-1

Recent discoveries on the role of commensal microbiota have significantly changed our understanding of human physiology. The host-microbiota interplay is now an important aspect to take into account to understand immune responses and immunological diseases. Autoimmune uveitis is a sight-threatening disease that arises without a known infectious etiology. It is unknown where and how autoreactive T cells become primed to trigger disease in the eye, which is an immune privileged site. We recently reported data supporting the notion that retina-specific T cells receive a signal in the gut from commensal microbiota-derived cross-reactive antigen(s) and trigger autoimmune uveitis in the R161H mouse model. Here we discuss our published findings, as well as our recent attempts to identify the responsible microbe(s) by using different antibiotic treatments, 16S rDNA sequencing and homology searches for candidate antigenic mimic(s) of the retinal antigen.",24,2017-Jan-02

Uveitis is a frequently occurring extra-articular manifestation of spondyloarthropathies (SpAs), ankylosing spondylitis (AS), reactive arthritis (ReA), psoriatic arthritis (PsA) and inflammatory bowel disease (IBD), occurring in both adults and children with SpA. Uveitis occurs with varying frequency according to the SpA subtype (33% in AS, 6-9% in PsA, 25% in ReA, 13% in undifferentiated SpA and 2-5% in IBD), the presence of HLA-B27 and with increasing duration of disease. The majority of cases of uveitis in SpA are attributed to acute anterior uveitis but a minority of uveitis cases occur in the posterior segment of the eye. The latter are more frequently complicated by cystoid macular oedema (CMO) and sight loss. The nature of the tissue specificity exhibited by the SpAs is poorly understood. Three current investigational approaches are discussed: high-throughput genomics to identify and confirm uveitis-specific susceptibility alleles; investigation of the role of the intestinal microbiome and its potential role in innate immune signalling in uveitis; and study of a novel IL23R-bearing cell population in several entheseal sites including the eye. The treatment for uveitis in SpAs is predominantly with topical corticosteroids for acute episodes. Among the systemic drugs used for the treatment of SpAs, infliximab, adalimumab and certolizumab are effective in reducing the frequency of uveitis but etanercept is not. Other targets in spondyloarthropathy include cytokines within the IL23/IL17 axis, of which the IL17A inhibitor secukinumab has not been shown to be effective in uveitis. Future therapeutic approaches may include small molecules such as selective and non-selective janus kinase and tyrosine kinase inhibitors.",24,2017-Dec-1

To report on experience using the anti-interleukin 6 receptor antibody tocilizumab (TCZ) to treat severe and therapy-refractory uveitis associated with juvenile idiopathic arthritis (JIA).
METHODS: Retrospective data were gathered from patients with JIA receiving TCZ treatment for uveitis. JIA and related uveitis data (disease onset, activity, structural complications, and topical and systemic antiinflammatory treatment) were evaluated at the start of TCZ (baseline) and every 3 months during TCZ therapy.
RESULTS: A total of 17 patients (14 women) with active uveitis were included (mean age 15.3 ± 6.9 yrs, mean followup time 8.5 mos). In all patients, uveitis had been refractory to previous topical and systemic corticosteroids, methotrexate (MTX), and other synthetic and biological disease-modifying antirheumatic drugs, including ≥ 1 tumor necrosis factor-α (TNF-α) inhibitor. Uveitis inactivity was achieved in 10 patients after a mean of 5.7 months of TCZ treatment (in 3 of them, it recurred during followup) and persisted in the remaining 7 patients. By using TCZ, systemic corticosteroids or immunosuppressives could be spared in 7 patients. Macular edema was present in 5 patients at baseline and improved in all of them under TCZ treatment. Arthritis was active in 11 patients at the initial and in 6 at the final followup visit.
CONCLUSION: TCZ appears to represent a therapeutic option for severe JIA-associated uveitis that has been refractory to MTX and TNF-α inhibitors in selected patients. The present data indicate that inflammatory macular edema responds well to TCZ in patients with JIA-associated uveitis.",24,2016-Dec-1

To study the value and safety of aqueous humor polymerase chain reaction (PCR) analysis for Herpes simplex, varicella zoster, cytomegalovirus, Epstein-Barr virus and Toxoplasma gondii in patients with uveitis.
METHODS: Records of 45 consecutive patients with anterior and posterior uveitis who underwent AC paracentesis with PCR were reviewed. The main outcome measure was frequency of PCR positivity. Secondary outcomes were alteration of treatment, safety of paracentesis, and correlation of keratitic precipitates with PCR positivity, RESULTS: The overall PCR positivity was 48.9 % (22/45). Therapy was changed because of the PCR results in 14/45 patients (37.7 %). One patient experienced a paracentesis related complication (1/45, 2.2 %) without long-term sequelae.
CONCLUSION: Aqueous PCR altered the diagnosis and treatment in over a third of our patients and was relatively safe. Aqueous PCR should be considered for uveitis of atypical clinical appearance, recurrent severe uveitis of uncertain etiology, and therapy refractory cases.",24,2016-Oct-28

To study the effect of the duration of anti-tubercular treatment (ATT) on the recurrence of uveitis associated with latent tuberculosis (TB).
METHODS: Retrospective review of all consecutive uveitis patients seen at a single, tertiary institution over 9 years with uveitis consistent with TB, positive tuberculin skin test with other causes ruled out, and a minimum of 6 months follow-up after completion of treatment. Clinical characteristics, treatment type, treatment duration and clinical response were recorded. Our main outcome measure was the effect of ATT duration on the recurrence of inflammation.
RESULTS: Of the 182 eligible patients, 46 received ATT of ≥ 6 month's duration; 18 patients defaulted and received < 6 months treatment. The patients' mean age was 45.3 ± 13.2 years and most were female (n=118, 57.6%) and of Chinese race (n=104, 50.7%). Patients who completed > 9 months ATT were less likely to develop recurrence compared with those not treated with ATT (OR 0.09; 95% CI 0.01 to 0.76; p=0.027), while adjusting for potential confounders such as patient demographics, anatomical location of uveitis and corticosteroid therapy.

This study reports outcomes of phacoemulsification cataract extraction and posterior chamber intraocular lens implantation within the capsular bag in patients with uveitis.
METHODS: We retrospectively reviewed the charts of 32 patients (39 eyes) with uveitis who underwent phacoemulsification cataract extraction and posterior chamber intraocular lens implantation by two surgeons at The Cleveland Clinic Foundation from January 1990 to June 1998. Patients with less than 3 months of follow-up were excluded.
RESULTS: Diagnoses of uveitis included idiopathic (15 eyes), sarcoidosis (10 eyes), pars planitis (four eyes), CMV retinitis (two eyes), Fuchs heterochromic iridocyclitis (two eyes), syphilis (two eyes), and one eye each of tuberculosis, Crohn's disease, HLA-B27 associated, and acute retinal necrosis. Average follow-up was 20 months (range, 3 to 63 months). Best-corrected visual acuity improved in 37 eyes (95%). Average improvement was 4 +/- 3 Snellen acuity lines (range, 1 to 10 lines). Thirty-four eyes (87%) attained final visual acuity better than or equal to 20/40. Visual loss occurred in one eye (3%) with CMV retinitis. No improvement in visual acuity was seen in one eye (3%) that developed a retinal pigment epithelial detachment. Posterior capsule opacification occurred in 24 eyes (62%), 12 of which required Nd:YAG capsulotomy (31%). Other postoperative complications included recurrence of uveitis (41%), cystoid macular edema (33%), epiretinal membrane formation (15%), and posterior synechiae (8%).
CONCLUSIONS: Phacoemulsification cataract extraction with posterior chamber intraocular lens implantation is safe in patients with uveitis. The incidences of recurrence of uveitis, cystoid macular edema, epiretinal membrane, and posterior synechiae were lower than those reported previously for extracapsular cataract extraction.",24,2001-May-1

A retrospective study on 1,417 uveitic patients referred to the Ocular Immunovirology Service of the University of Rome 'La Sapienza' was carried out to determine the occurrence of the various forms of uveitis. To detect also the possible changing patterns of uveitis during the last 25 years the obtained data were compared with those reported in two previous studies performed by the same author, at the same institution in 1978 and 1985. Anterior uveitis was the most frequent anatomical type of intraocular inflammation (49.12%); intermediate uveitis was diagnosed in 12.42% of all the cases and showed an increased incidence over the years (p < 0.0001). Posterior and diffuse uveitis accounted for 22.1 and 16.37% of the cases. An improvement in diagnostic definition has been confirmed by the significant decrease in the percentage of 'idiopathic uveitis' from 56.8 to 38.1% (p < 0.0001). Associated infectious conditions were detected in 17.43% of the cases. Toxoplasma gondii was the most common etiologic agent of uveitis (6.63%). An associated systemic disease was diagnosed in 15.03% of uveitic patients, and 6% of them were affected with Behçet's disease. Specific ocular diseases and clinical entities increased from 7.8 and 14.68% to 29.42% in the last 25 years (p < 0.0001), the most frequent being pars planitis (11.99%) and Fuchs' heterochromic iridocyclitis (8.32%).",24,1996-1-1

Histopathologic findings in 158 globes obtained from 139 cats by enucleation or at necropsy, with histopathologic diagnosis of uveitis, were compared, and morphology was correlated with clinical and/or histopathologic diagnosis. The most common morphologic feature was a lymphocytic-plasmacytic anterior uveal infiltrate that was either diffuse or nodular; specific cause could not be associated with this nongranulomatous anterior uveitis. In decreasing order of frequency, other common causes of uveitis in cats included feline infectious peritonitis; FeLV-associated lymphosarcoma; trauma; and lens-induced uveitis.",24,1991-Jan-01

To evaluate the role of HLA typing as a diagnostic test in patients with uveitis.
DESIGN: Perspective derived from a literature review and analysis of reported results.
METHODS: Published data on the HLA associations of several uveitis entities and their prevalence among patients and the general population were used to calculate the positive predictive value of HLA testing as a diagnostic test for these disorders.
RESULTS: For nearly all diagnostic entities evaluated (including multiple sclerosis-associated intermediate uveitis, birdshot chorioretinitis, sympathetic ophthalmic, Behçet disease, and Vogt-Koyanagi-Harada disease), the positive predictive value was low (< 0.50), indicating the limited usefulness of routinely applied HLA typing as a diagnostic test. HLA-B27 testing may be of value in identifying a previously undiagnosed or misdiagnosed spondyloarthropathy among patients with recurrent acute anterior uveitis.
CONCLUSIONS: In general, HLA typing has limited usefulness as a diagnostic test in patients with uveitis.",24,2010-Feb-1

Uveitis in childhood is a visual threatening disease with a complication rate of more than 75%. Despite extensive research, the etiology of uveitis is still unclear although the general opinion is now that uveitis is a T-cell mediated disease. The purpose of this study was to investigate the profile of cytokines, chemotactic cytokines (chemokines) and soluble adhesion molecules in the aqueous humor (AqH) of children with uveitis in order to identify the factors that control the immune response in the eye. In this clinical laboratory investigation we analyzed, with a multiplex immunoassay, 16 immune mediators in the AqH of 25 children with uveitis and 6 children without uveitis. Increased levels of interleukin-2 (IL-2), IL-6, IL-10, IL-13, IL-18, interferon-gamma, tumor necrosis factor-alpha, soluble intercellular adhesion molecule-1, RANTES, IL-8 and interferon-inducible 10-kDa protein were found in the AqH of children with uveitis compared with controls. No significant differences were found for IL-1 beta, IL-4, IL-12 p-70, soluble vascular cell adhesion molecule 1 and Eotaxin. Lower levels of IL-10 and IL-8 were found in quiet stage uveitis (surgical) samples compared with active uveitis (diagnostic) samples and in samples of patients treated with methotrexate (MTX) compared with samples of patients not treated with MTX. Lower levels of IL-10 were as well found in samples taken during the first 3 months after the diagnosis of uveitis than samples taken later during the disease process. No significant differences were found between patients treated with or without topical or systemic (perioperative and long term) corticosteroids. In conclusion, in children with uveitis, multiple intraocular cytokines, chemokines and soluble adhesion molecules are increased in the AqH regardless of active or inactive inflammation. Whether the IL-8 and IL-10 levels in AqH of children with uveitis are correlated with uveitis activity, early or late phase of the course of the disease and systemic treatment with MTX needs further investigation in a bigger study population.",24,2007-Oct-1

Human leukocyte antigen (HLA)-B27-associated anterior uveitis (AU) is the most commonly diagnosed form of AU and represents the largest entity of non-infectious uveitis around the world. The most typical ocular manifestation associated with HLA-B27 consists of unilateral AU of acute onset. The HLA-B27-associated acute AU represents a distinct clinical entity occurring typically in young adults between the ages of 20 and 40 years. HLA-B27-associated acute AU is typically unilateral and lasts usually several weeks and diminishes within 3 months in the majority of patients. The anterior chamber shows typically severe cellular reaction and flare, as well as a fibrinous exudate. Frequently, posterior synechiae are formed and occasionally hypopyon is present. The pattern of the disease is recurrent with a full remission between the attacks. Intraocular pressure during active periods is typically low due to inflammation of ciliary body and decreased aqueous production. Less typical presentations are also recognized and include the development of chronic inflammation, posterior segment involvement, episcleritis, and scleritis. An isolated retinal vasculitis in HLA-B27-positive patients may develop, mostly in those with inflammatory bowel disease. Chronic AU, which may be either unilateral or bilateral affects up to 20% of patients. Ocular complications of HLA-B27-associated AU are diverse and include commonly posterior synechiae, cataract, glaucoma and/or hypotony. The visual outcome and complications of HLA-B27-associated AAU are frequently being compared with HLA B27-negative patients with AU and show that the prognosis of HLA-B27-associated uveitis is rather favorable, as <2% developed legal blindness and <5% visual impairment. A novel algorithm called the ""Dublin Uveitis Evaluation Tool (DUET)"" has been proposed to guide ophthalmologists to refer appropriate HLA-B27-positive patients with uveitis to rheumatologists.",23,2017-Aug-1

Interleukin-6 (IL-6) is a key cytokine that is strongly up-regulated during infection and inflammation. Featuring pleiotropic activity, IL-6 is responsible for the induction of hepatic acute-phase proteins, trafficking of acute and chronic inflammatory cells, differentiation of adaptive T cell responses, homeostatic regulation, and tissue regeneration. Dysregulated IL-6 production has been associated with the development of a wide variety of systemic immune-mediated, chronic diseases, and even certain types of cancer. From the ocular perspective, significant elevation of IL-6 has been found in ocular fluids derived from diabetic macular edema, retinal vein occlusion, and refractory/chronic uveitis patients. During the last decade, tocilizumab, a neutralizing monoclonal antibody (mAb) that targets the IL-6 receptor (IL-6R), has been approved for the treatment of rheumatoid arthritis in >100 countries worldwide. Furthermore, it has been reported to be effective for the treatment of a number of autoimmune diseases including uveitis and its associated macular edema. Currently numerous candidate molecular strategies targeting the IL-6 signaling pathways are in progress through clinical trials in various disorders. Herein we discuss the basic biology of IL-6 and its pathological role in the development of immune-mediated conditions, particularly focusing on inflammatory eye diseases. It also provides an overview of the on-going clinical trials with the new anti-IL-6 mAbs and their potential use in the clinical practice.",23,2017-Oct-1

Blau syndrome is a monogenic disease resulting from mutations in nucleotide oligomerization domain 2 (NOD2) and is phenotypically characterized by granulomatous polyarthritis and uveitis. Not only there has been significant progress in disease characterization but also the biological pathways associated with NOD2 and related proteins of the innate immunity are better understood.
RECENT FINDINGS: The phenotype of Blau syndrome has proven to be more complex than initially thought. A discussion on those manifestations will be provided in the clinical sections of this review. As more patients and pedigrees are found new mutations in the NOD2 gene have emerged and we discuss them in some detail. Due to its importance in Crohn's disease NOD2 has become the focus of intense research. A brief review of more recent advances in relevant pathways is presented and published reviews referenced for the interested reader. The granulomatous character of Blau syndrome provides an opportunity to look at possible pathogenic effects of NOD2 'gain of function'. New immunohistochemical data are briefly reviewed as well.
SUMMARY: Elucidation of downstream effects of NOD2 mutations could provide valuable clues to mechanisms of arthritis and uveitis in general as well as granulomatous diseases in particular.",23,2011-Sep-1

Tissue expression of CD200 generates inhibitory or down-regulatory signals to macrophages and microglia within CNS and retina. Our interests were to investigate whether blocking CD200 receptor (CD200R) signalling in vivo results in macrophage activation and thus aggravation of EAU in Lewis rats.
METHODS: Retinal extract-immunised Lewis rats were treated day 3 and 5 post-immunisation with CD200R mAb or normal mouse serum. Phenotypic analysis of the leucocyte infiltrate and disease severity was clinically and histogically examined.
RESULTS: Rats administered with CD200R mAb developed earlier onset of EAU and more severe disease. Blocking CD200R increased retinal neuronal CD200 expression and, although disease severity was increased concomitant with an increase in NOS-2 expression, retinal macrophage numbers were not increased.
CONCLUSIONS: Contemporaneous with data from CD200KO mice, these results support the notion that CD200-CD200R signalling suppresses macrophage activation. Exacerbation of EAU in both CD200KO mice and Lewis rats when CD200-CD200R interaction is blocked suggests that this could be an avenue for therapeutic intervention.",23,2004-Jun-1

To evaluate the outcome of tumor necrosis factor-α inhibition (anti-TNF) for pediatric uveitis.
METHODS: We retrospectively assessed children (age ≤ 18 yrs) with noninfectious uveitis receiving anti-TNF at 5 uveitis centers and 1 pediatric rheumatology center. Incident treatment success was defined as minimal or no uveitis activity at ≥ 2 consecutive ophthalmological examinations ≥ 28 days apart while taking no oral and ≤ 2 eyedrops/day of corticosteroids. Eligible children had active uveitis and/or were taking higher corticosteroid doses.
RESULTS: Among 56 eligible children followed over 33.73 person-years, 52% had juvenile idiopathic arthritis (JIA) and 75% had anterior uveitis (AU). The Kaplan-Meier estimated proportion achieving treatment success within 12 months was 75% (95% CI 62%-87%). Complete absence of inflammatory signs with discontinuation of all corticosteroids was observed in an estimated 64% by 12 months (95% CI 51%-76%). Diagnoses of JIA or AU were associated with greater likelihood of success, as was the oligoarticular subtype among JIA cases. In a multivariable model, compared to those with JIA-associated AU, those with neither or with JIA or AU alone had a 75%-80% lower rate of achieving quiescence under anti-TNF, independent of the number of immunomodulators previously or concomitantly prescribed. Uveitis reactivated within 12 months of achieving quiescence in 14% of those continuing anti-TNF (95% CI 6%-31%). The incidence of discontinuation for adverse effects was 8%/year (95% CI 1%-43%).
CONCLUSION: Treatment with anti-TNF was successful and sustained in a majority of children with noninfectious uveitis, and treatment-limiting toxicity was infrequent. JIA-associated AU may be especially responsive to anti-TNF.",23,2013-Aug-1

To review issues related to the diagnosis, examination, and treatment of children with uveitis that are important for ophthalmologists.
DESIGN: Literature review.
METHOD: A review was made of pertinent reports from the medical literature, with commentary based on the authors' experiences and on discussions at an international workshop.
RESULTS: There are differences between children and adults in the differential diagnosis and manifestations of uveitis that should be considered during evaluation. There may be a higher risk of some ocular complications such as uveitic glaucoma, and the presence of other unique complications, such as amblyopia, in young patients during follow-up. With regard to treatment, children with uveitis may have unique dosing requirements and drug-associated risks such as growth retardation with systemic corticosteroids that must be considered. Examination and treatment may also be more difficult with children because of problems with patient cooperation.
CONCLUSIONS: There are unique patient care issues associated with uveitis in children that must be considered by care providers. Attention to these issues will improve the well-being of this patient population.",23,2003-Jun-1

To characterize the level of depression in patients with ocular inflammatory disease and to determine predictors of depression in this population.
DESIGN: Prospective cross-sectional survey and medical record review.
METHODS: Participants were consecutive patients with noninfectious ocular inflammatory disease in a university-based tertiary referral center. Subjects were given the self-administered Beck Depression Inventory-II (BDI-II), National Eye Institute Visual Function Questionnaire-25 (NEI VFQ-25), and additional supplemental questions. Medical records were reviewed for clinical characteristics. Univariate analyses were conducted to compare clinical characteristics between patients with and without a positive screen for depression, and a multivariate regression model was performed to determine the most significant predictors of depression.
RESULTS: Of the 104 participants, 26.9% screened positive for depression with the BDI-II. Of these subjects, only 39.3% had been previously diagnosed with depression. NEI VFQ-25 scores were significantly lower in depressed patients in all subscales except driving and color vision. Predictors of depression were inadequate emotional support, lower visual functioning (VFQ composite score), history of changing immunomodulatory treatment, and current oral corticosteroid use.
CONCLUSIONS: Depression may be a significant but underrecognized comorbid condition in patients with ocular inflammatory disease. Worse visual function was associated with depression. The authors recommend heightened awareness of potential depression in patients with ocular inflammatory disease.",23,2012-Feb-1

The ocular complications of Behçet's disease are considered one of the major criteria upon which the diagnosis is based. Its complications are frequently sight threatening and require constant attention. The ocular disease is characterized by repeated, explosive ocular inflammatory attacks which get better by themselves, so that in-between attacks there is little or no evidence of inflammatory disease in the eye. The anterior segment can be involved alone, most frequently presenting as a severe anterior uveitis, frequently with hypopyon. This is not associated with a poor visual outcome, and usually treated with topical medication to make the patient more comfortable. However, the anterior segment disease is usually accompanied by recurrent retinal vaso-occlusive disease which is sight threatening if repeated attacks occur. Treatment is with systemic medications, including corticosteroids, cyclosporine, FK506, anti-metabolites, and cytotoxic agents. Complications of the inflammation can include retinal and optic atrophy, vitreous hemorrhage, neovascular glaucoma, and retinal detachment.",23,1997-1-1

Glucocorticoids are used to treat macular edema, although the mechanisms underlying this effect remain largely unknown. The authors have evaluated in the normal and endotoxin-induced uveitis (EIU) rats, the effects of dexamethasone (dex) and triamcinolone acetonide (TA) on potassium channel Kir4.1 and aquaporin-4 (AQP4), the two main retinal Müller glial (RMG) channels controlling retinal fluid movement.
METHODS: Clinical as well as relatively low doses of dex and TA were injected in the vitreous of normal rats to evaluate their influence on Kir4.1 and AQP4 expression 24 hours later. The dose-dependent effects of the two glucocorticoids were investigated using rat neuroretinal organotypic cultures. EIU was induced by footpad lipopolysaccharide injection, without or with 100 nM intraocular dex or TA. Glucocorticoid receptor and channel expression levels were measured by quantitative PCR, Western blot, and immunohistochemistry.
RESULTS: The authors found that dex and TA exert distinct and specific channel regulations at 24 hours after intravitreous injection. Dex selectively upregulated Kir4.1 (not AQP4) in healthy and inflamed retinas, whereas TA induced AQP4 (not Kir4.1) downregulation in normal retina and upregulation in EIU. The lower concentration (100 nM) efficiently regulated the channels. Moreover, in EIU, an inflammatory condition, the glucocorticoid receptor was downregulated in the retina, which was prevented by intravitreous injections of the low concentration of dex or TA.
CONCLUSIONS: The results show that dex and TA are far from being equivalent to modulate RMG channels. Furthermore, the authors suggest that low doses of glucocorticoids may have antiedematous effects on the retina with reduced toxicity.",23,2011-Aug-11

This retrospective study investigated the efficacy of tocilizumab (TCZ), a fully humanized antibody that binds both to soluble and membrane bound IL-6 receptors, for the treatment of uveitis-related cystoid macular edema (CME) refractory to immunomodulatory therapy.
METHODS: Five refractory patients with uveitis-related CME who received TCZ between January and August 2012 were included. All patients received 8 mg/kg TCZ at 4-week intervals. Data regarding patient demographics, use of immunosuppressive drugs, biologic agents or intravitreal therapies prior to TCZ infusions were collected. Main outcome measure was central foveal thickness (CFT) measured by optical coherence tomography at 6 months. Secondary outcome measures were degree of anterior and posterior chamber inflammation (Standardization of Uveitis Nomenclature Working Group criteria) and visual acuity (logarithm of the minimum angle of resolution [log-MAR]) at month 6. Adverse events (AEs) related to TCZ therapy were also assessed.
RESULTS: Eight eyes from five patients (all females) were included. Mean age was 49.4 years (range, 30-68). Mean follow-up was 8.4 months (range, 6-12). Before TCZ, all patients received and failed conventional immunosuppressive therapy and had received at least another biologic agent. Uveitis diagnoses were Birdshot chorioretinopathy (n = 3), juvenile idiopathic arthritis (JIA)-associated uveitis (n = 1), and idiopathic panuveitis (n = 1). Mean evolution of CME was 13.4 years (range, 2-30). Mean baseline CFT (95% confidence interval) was 602 ± 236 μm at baseline, 386 ± 113 μm at month 1 (p = 0.006), 323 ± 103 μm at month 3 (p = 0.026), and 294.5 ± 94.5 μm at month 6 (p = 0.014). Median best-corrected visual acuity (BCVA) improved from 0.66 ± 0.57 at baseline to 0.47 ± 0.62 at month 6 (p = 0.035). After 6 months, an improvement of ≥ 2 lines of BCVA was observed in 50% of eyes (p = 0.028) remained stable in 25% and worsened in none of the patients. Sustained uveitis remission was achieved in all patients. No AEs were reported.
CONCLUSIONS: These data suggest that TCZ is effective for treating CME in otherwise treatment-refractory cases of uveitis.",23,2013-Nov-1

To evaluate the effect of intravitreal ranibizumab injections (Lucentis; Genentech Inc, South San Francisco, California, USA) on refractory cystoid macular edema (CME) in patients with controlled uveitis who have failed oral and regional corticosteroid treatment, the mainstays of current medical therapy.
DESIGN: Prospective, noncomparative, interventional case series.
METHODS: Seven consecutive patients with controlled uveitis and refractory CME who had failed corticosteroid treatment were studied. One eligible patient chose not to participate and another did not complete follow-up for nonmedical reasons. Intravitreal ranibizumab injections (0.5 mg) were given monthly for 3 months, followed by reinjection as needed. The primary outcome was the mean change in best spectacle-corrected visual acuity (VA) from baseline to 3 months, and the secondary objective was the mean change in central retinal thickness (CRT) on ocular coherence tomography. Six-month outcomes were also assessed.
RESULTS: At 3 months, the mean increase in acuity for the 6 patients who completed follow-up was 13 letters (2.5 lines), and the mean decrease in CRT was 357 mum. Both VA and CRT improved significantly between baseline and 3 months (P = .03 for each). Although most patients required reinjection, this benefit was maintained at 6 months. There were no significant ocular or systemic adverse effects.
CONCLUSIONS: Intravitreal ranibizumab led to an increase in VA and regression of uveitis-associated CME in patients refractory to or intolerant of standard corticosteroid therapy. Further studies of this promising treatment are warranted.",23,2009-Aug-1

With the increased use of data from electronic medical records for research, it is important to validate International Classification of Diseases, Ninth Revision (ICD-9) codes for their respective diagnoses.
OBJECTIVE: To assess the accuracy of using ICD-9 codes to identify ocular inflammatory diseases.
DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: Retrospective secondary database analysis. The setting was Kaiser Permanente Hawaii, an integrated managed care consortium that serves approximately 15% of the general Hawaiian population. Participants were patients with ICD-9 diagnosis codes that might be associated with a diagnosis of ocular inflammation seen at Kaiser Permanente Hawaii between January 1, 2006, and December 31, 2007. The data collection and analysis took place from January 2011 to August 2015.
MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: The main outcome was the positive predictive value (PPV) of ICD-9 codes for identifying specific types of ocular inflammatory disease. The PPVs were calculated by determining the ratio of the confirmed cases found by medical record review to the total number of cases identified by ICD-9 code.
RESULTS: Of the 873 patients identified by a comprehensive list of ICD-9 codes for ocular inflammatory diseases, 224 cases were confirmed as uveitis after medical record review. Using a set of uveitis-specific codes and eliminating patients with a history of ocular surgery, the overall PPV for uveitis was 61% (95% CI, 56%-66%). The PPVs for individual uveitis codes ranged from 0% to 100%, and 11 uveitis codes had a PPV exceeding 80%. Herpes zoster ophthalmicus and scleritis/episcleritis ICD-9 codes had PPVs of 91% (95% CI, 86%-95%) and 60% (95% CI, 54%-66%), respectively.
CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: Our results suggest that using ICD-9 codes alone to capture uveitis and scleritis/episcleritis diagnoses is not sufficient in the Kaiser Permanente Hawaii healthcare system, although there were specific uveitis codes with high PPVs. However, the electronic medical record can reliably be used to identify herpes zoster ophthalmicus cases. Medical record review, as was done in this study, is recommended to elucidate diagnoses for uveitis and scleritis/episcleritis.",23,2016-Sep-01

Uveitis is usually considered as a vision-threatening multiple system intraocular inflammatory disease. Among uveitis, Vogt-Koyanagi-Harada (VKH) disease and Behcet's disease (BD) are common non-infectious uveitis entities. Although the exact pathogenesis of uveitis is not yet clear, it is acknowledged that the combination of a certain genetic or epigenetic factors with an imbalance in the regulation of the immune response leads to the development of this disease. HLA genes show a strong association with both VKH disease (HLA-DR4, DRB1/DQA1) and BD (HLA-B51) in multiple ethnic populations. Candidate association studies based on a pathogenesis hypothesis laid the foundation for genetic research of uveitis and identified a large number of genes associated with VKH disease or BD including SUMO4, MCP-1, and CTLA4. Genome-wide association study (GWAS) provided a powerful tool for genome-wide level analysis to explore the genetic predisposition for uveitis and revealed several genes to be associated with uveitis including IL23R/C1orf141, STAT4 and ADO/ZNF365/EGR2. Another variant type, the so called copy number variants (CNV), in IL17F, IL23A and C4A also showed an association with uveitis. Additionally, epigenetic factors such as DNA methylation and ncRNAs play important roles in the development of uveitis. The application of new technologies such as whole exome sequencing and whole genome sequencing and other epigenetic modifications such as N6-methyl-adenosine (m6A) modification of mRNAs will be helpful to discover new pathogenic risk genes for uveitis. The understanding of the genetic and epigenetic mechanisms in uveitis may provide a foundation to find novel targets and to develop new strategies in the treatment of uveitis in the near future.",23,2020-Jan-1

To document the incidence and clinical features of syphilitic uveitis in patients coinfected with human immunodeficiency virus (HIV).
DESIGN: Retrospective chart review.
SETTINGS: Single tertiary uveitis referral center.
PATIENTS: The charts of HIV-infected patients with uveitis and a reactive fluorescent treponemal antibody absorption test seen between November 1983 and June 1995 were reviewed.
RESULTS: Syphilis was the most common bacterial cause of uveitis in this group. Thirteen patients (0.6% of the 2085 HIV-positive patients seen in the clinic during the study period) were dually infected. Twelve patients were male. Six patients (46%) had previously been treated for syphilis, 4 with intramuscular penicillin G benzathine only. Four patients (31%) had isolated anterior uveitis, 3 patients (23%) had anterior and intermediate uveitis, and 5 patients (38%) had panuveitis. One patient (8%) presented with optic nerve and retinal atrophy. Eight patients were treated with intravenous penicillin, 3 with intravenous and intramuscular penicillin, and 1 with intravenous ceftriaxone sodium. Of the 12 patients for whom follow-up examinations were available after treatment, ocular inflammation decreased in 11 (92%) and visual acuity improved in 8 (67%). Rapid plasma reagin titers decreased a median of 64-fold compared with pretreatment levels, and all patients with reactive cerebrospinal fluid who underwent pretreatment and posttreatment lumbar punctures normalized following therapy with intravenous antibiotics.
CONCLUSIONS: Syphilis is an uncommon cause of uveitis in HIV-infected patients. Anterior uveitis is the most common ocular manifestation, but panuveitis is more common than isolated anterior uveitis. Intravenous penicillin is effective therapy.",23,1997-Apr-1

At a university based referral clinic, 236 consecutive patients with uveitis were evaluated by a rheumatologist; 13% of these patients had spondyloarthritis including 17 patients with Reiter's syndrome and 13 patients with ankylosing spondylitis (AS). The uveitis associated with AS or Reiter's syndrome had distinctive characteristics; it was acute in onset, unilateral, frequently recurrent, and spared the choroid and retina. Two thirds of the patients with spondyloarthritis were not suspected or known to have Reiter's syndrome or AS before referral. Since many diseases of the joints also affect the uveal tract, the recognition of the specific pattern of uveal involvement can greatly facilitate the differential diagnosis.",23,1989-Jun-1

Nitric oxide (NO) has been implicated in the pathogenesis of several inflammatory diseases. In the present study, we investigated the potential role of NO in an ocular model of inflammation, endotoxin-induced uveitis (EIU), in Lewis rats. Injection of LPS in one footpad induces severe uveitis after 16 h, which is accompanied by an increase of NO in the aqueous and vitreous humors, as evaluated by nitrite assay. Reverse transcriptase-PCR experiments reveal a large increase of inducible NO synthase (iNOS) mRNA in the iris/ciliary body, from 2 to 24 h after LPS treatment. In the retina, maximal increase of iNOS mRNA was detected 16 h after LPS treatment. Two i.p. injections of the NOS inhibitor, NG-nitro-L-arginine methyl ester (L-NAME), which inhibits nitrite release in the aqueous and vitreous humors, profoundly reduce clinical and histologic inflammation in EIU rats. These results implicate the NO pathway in the pathogenesis of EIU and demonstrate the possibility of modulating this inflammatory disease by injection of a NOS inhibitor.",23,1995-Jun-15

Functional macrophage heterogeneity is well appreciated outside the CNS in wound healing and cancer, and was recently also demonstrated in several CNS compartments after ""sterile"" insults. Yet, such heterogeneity was largely overlooked in the context of inflammatory autoimmune pathology, in which macrophages were mainly associated with disease induction and propagation. In this article, we show the diversity of monocyte-derived macrophages along the course of experimental autoimmune uveitis, an inflammatory condition affecting the ocular system, serving as a model for CNS autoimmune pathology. Disease induction resulted in the appearance of a distinct myeloid population in the retina, and in the infiltration of monocyte-derived macrophages that were absent from control eyes. During the disease course, the frequency of CX3CR1(high) infiltrating macrophages that express markers associated with inflammation-resolving activity was increased, along with a decrease in the frequency of inflammation-associated Ly6C(+) macrophages. Inhibition of monocyte infiltration at the induction phase of experimental autoimmune uveitis prevented disease onset, whereas monocyte depletion at the resolution phase resulted in a decrease in Foxp3(+) regulatory T cells and in exacerbated disease. Thus, monocyte-derived macrophages display distinct phenotypes throughout the disease course, even in an immune-induced pathology, reflecting their differential roles in disease induction and resolution.",23,2013-Apr-01

To investigate the dynamics and distribution of toll-like receptor 4 (TLR4)-positive cells and resident tissue macrophages in the uvea during endotoxin-induced uveitis (EIU) in Wistar rats.
METHODS: Wistar rats (n=40) received a footpad injection of 200 microg of Vibrio cholera lipopolysaccharide (LPS), and the intensity of anterior segment inflammation was evaluated after the LPS injection. Ten rats each were killed 6, 12, 24 and 48 h after injection. Ten normal Wistar rats were killed as controls (0 h). The iris-ciliary body complex and choroids from each eye were removed and subdivided into segments. Immunohistochemical localization of TLR4 and a resident tissue macrophage marker, cluster of differentiation 163 (CD163), was performed on whole mount isolated iris-ciliary body complexes and choroids. TLR4+ and CD163+ cells in the iris were manually counted, and the cell density (cells/mm(2)) was calculated. The distribution patterns and phenotypes of cells expressing these two proteins were further characterized by double-labeled immunofluorescence studies.
RESULTS: The iris-ciliary body complex did not express TLR4 in normal rats. TLR4+ cells were detectable in the iris stroma 6 h after injection, and the number significantly increased (p<0.001 by one-way ANOVA) 12, 24, and 48 h after injection. The morphology of TLR4+ cells hardly changed 12-48 h after injection. CD163 was expressed in the uvea in all rats. During the inflammatory response phase (0-48 h after injection), the proportion of CD163+ tissue macrophages having a round morphology increased (p<0.001 by one-way ANOVA) concurrently with a decrease in the proportion of dendritiform CD163+ cells. These changes occurred mainly in the macrophages located in the stroma bordering the iris endothelial layer. Double-labeling immunofluorescence demonstrated the co-expression of TLR4 and CD163 in round stroma cells with TLR4 located at the cell membrane and CD163 in the cytoplasm. TLR4+ cells could not be detected in choroids in any of the rats.
CONCLUSIONS: The results of the present study indicate that TLR4 expression increased in the iris and iris tissue macrophages expressed TLR4 during EIU. This has significant implications for the understanding of ocular inflammation and for interpreting the potential role of Gram-negative bacteria in the pathogenesis of acute anterior uveitis.",23,2009-1-1

Uveitis is a heterogeneous collection of diseases with polygenic and environmental influences. This heterogeneity presents challenges in trial design and selection of end points. Despite the multitude of causes, therapeutics targeting common inflammatory pathways are effective in treating diverse forms of uveitis. These treatments, including corticosteroids and immunomodulatory agents, although often effective, can have untoward side effects, limiting their utility. The search for drugs with equal or improved efficacy that are safe is therefore paramount. A mechanism-based approach is most likely to yield the future breakthroughs in the treatment of uveitis. We review the literature and provide examples of the nuances of immune regulation and dysregulation that can be targeted for therapeutic benefit. As our understanding of the causes of uveitis grows we will learn how to better apply antibodies designed to block interaction between inflammatory cytokines and their receptors. T-lymphocyte activation can be targeted by blocking co-stimulatory pathways or inhibiting major histocompatibility complex protein interactions. Furthermore, intracellular downstream molecules from cytokine or other pathways can be inhibited using small molecule inhibitors, which have the benefit of being orally bioavailable. An emerging field is the lipid-mediated inflammatory and regulatory pathways. Alternatively, anti-inflammatory cytokines can be provided by administering recombinant protein, and intracellular ""brakes"" of inflammatory pathways can be introduced potentially by gene therapy. Novel approaches of delivering a therapeutic substance include, but are not limited to, the use of small interfering RNA, viral and nonviral gene therapy, and microparticle or viscous gel sustained-release drug-delivery platforms.",23,2014-Jan-1

To report the anatomical pattern and etiological spectrum of uveitis in an urban multi-ethnic population from Barcelona, Spain. General and specific epidemiological data for the most prevalent aetiologies are also calculated.
METHODS: A cross-sectional study of consecutive uveitis cases was performed between 1 January 2009 and 31 December 2012. Exogenous endophthalmitis, surgery-related, post-traumatic and toxic uveitis along with masquerade syndromes were excluded. Anatomical (Standard Uveitis Nomenclature criteria) and aetiological patterns (by tailored tests), age, sex, geographical origin and laterality were analysed. Mean incidence and prevalence were calculated for a mid-period reference population.
RESULTS: From 1022 patients included, 52% were anterior uveitis (AU), 23% posterior, 15% panuveitis and 9% intermediate uveitis. Aetiologically, 26% were unclassifiable, 29% infectious, 25% associated with systemic immune diseases, and 20% corresponded to ocular-specific syndromes. Among classified causes, herpesvirus (12%), toxoplasma (7%), Behçet's disease (BD) (5%), HLA-B27-isolated AU (5%), ankylosing spondylitis (5%), tuberculosis-related uveitis (TRU) (5%), birdshot chorioretinopathy (3%) and sarcoidosis (3%) were the most frequent. Non-Spanish origin was recorded in 22%, with 47% of Vogt-Koyanagi-Harada and 36% of toxoplasma cases coming from South America, 10% of BD and 11% of TRU from Africa and 24% of TRU cases from Asia. A mean annual incidence of 51.91 cases/100,000 inhabitants was found for the referral population.
CONCLUSION: In our referral area, 74% of the uveitis cases can be correctly classified. A large myriad of uveitis aetiologies with a strong geographical origin burden are found in Western urban multi-ethnic populations.",23,2015-Sep-1

Conflicting reports have led to the description of nitric oxide as a ""double-edged sword"" in animal models of autoimmunity. In this study we show that tissue damage within the eye during experimental autoimmune uveoretinitis correlates with peroxynitrite formation in infiltrating monocytes/macrophages within the outer retina together with extensive photoreceptor apoptosis and apoptosis of Fas(+) T cells within the retina. Inducible nitric oxide synthase (NOS2) expression was primarily restricted to infiltrating monocytes/macrophages in the outer retina and photoreceptor rod outer segments (target tissue), but despite showing evidence of lipid peroxidation, myeloid cells remained resistant to apoptosis. The protective effect of the NOS inhibitor N(G)-nitro-L-arginine methyl ester could be attributed to dramatically reduced photoreceptor apoptosis, absence of nitrotyrosine formation, and reduced NOS2 protein expression. However, inhibition of NOS by N(G)-nitro-L-arginine methyl ester was accompanied by a sparing of CD3(+) and CD2(+) T cells despite continued expression of Fas and Fas ligand, thus compromising functional inactivation of T cells in the target tissue. These data suggests that in addition to contributing to tissue damage in the retina through generation of reactive oxygen species, nitric oxide also seems to be required for activation-induced cell death and elimination of T cells in the retina.",23,2002-Mar-1

In this article, we report a literature-based metanalysis we have conducted to outline the clinical features of the HLA-B27 Acute Anterior Uveitis (AAU). The examined material was based on observational studies in which participants were affected by Acute Anterior Uveitis and divided into HLA B27+ and HLA B27-. We performed a search on articles with the words ""HLA B27 uveitis"" dated before May 2014. Among these, 29 articles were selected for a second review. After a further evaluation, 22 articles were analyzed. The clinical characteristics studied in the metanalysis were: (1) systemic disease; (2) sex distribution; (3) laterality; (4) visual acuity; (5) hypopion; (6) anterior chamber's fibrin; (7) elevated intraocular pressure (IOP) during inflammation; (8) glaucoma; (9) posterior synechiae; (10) cataract; (11) cystoid macular edema; (12) papillitis. We have calculated a relative risk (RR) for each outcome measured. The results obtained remark some of the peculiar features linked to the HLA B27 Acute Anterior Uveitis, such as strong association with ankylosing spondylitis (RR = 6.80) and systemic diseases (RR = 9.9), male prevalence (RR = 1.2), unilateral (RR = 1.1) or alternating bilateral (RR = 2.2) involvement, hypopion (RR = 5.5), fibrinous reaction and even papillitis (R = 7.7). Simultaneous bilateral (RR = 0.3) AAU is more frequent in HLA-B27 negative form. We report higher risk of elevated IOP and glaucoma (RR = 0.6) in B27- Acute Anterior Uveitis. No significant difference between HLA B 27 positive and negative AAU was observed according to final visual acuity and complications such as posterior synechiae, cataract, and maculare edema. We trust that this will inform on the clinical evaluation and therapeutic decision in addressing a still ill-defined ophthalmologic condition.",23,2017-1-1

This review represents the current in vitro, in vivo, animal and human investigations on the roles of IL-10 in ocular inflammatory conditions.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: The data sources were literature reviews, including Pub Med, Medline, and ISI databases (since 1989 to mid-2012). Search items were, IL-10, chemokines, cytokines, alone or in combination with, serum, aqueous, vitreous eye, ocular, ocular tissues, ophthalmic, and review.
RESULTS: Ocular effects of IL-10 depend on the sources of the secretion and sites of the action. IL-10 plays important anti-inflammatory and especially anti-angiogenic activities in ocular tissues such as the conjunctiva, cornea, retina, choroid, and orbit.
CONCLUSION: IL-10 plays major anti-inflammatory and anti-angiogenic roles in most of the ocular inflammations. Also, IL-10 plays a role in development of anterior chamber-associated immune deviation (ACAID). Any manipulation of IL-10 for treatment purposes should be considered very cautiously due to its potential hazards to the immune system.",23,2012-Dec-1

The immunosuppressant cyclosporine is widely used to treat Behçet's disease (BD). The aim of this study was to determine whether cyclosporine increases the risk of neurological involvement in BD.
METHODS: Patient files from the Ophthalmology Department for the period 2000-2005 were screened retrospectively, and the occurrence of neurological involvement and its relationship to ocular severity were evaluated.
RESULTS: A total of 454 patients with BD were seen at the Ophthalmology Department in this period, including 24 who had been referred from the Neurology Department. Excluded from the study were 47 patients who did not have uveitis and 114 patients with an inadequate follow-up. The remaining 269 patients had been treated with either cyclosporine (Group I, n=92), other immunosuppressants (Group II, n=132), or no treatment other than colchicine (Group III, n=45). Patients with neurological symptoms were sent to the Neurology Department for evaluation: 20 from Group I [10 with primary headache, 1 with depression, 1 with sinus thrombosis, and 8 with parenchymal neurological involvement (pNBD)]; 13 from Group II [10 with primary headache, 1 with pre-morbid epilepsy, 1 with sinus thrombosis, and 1 with pNBD]; and 5 from Group III with primary headache. The frequency of pNBD was significantly higher in Group I, and included atypical features such as seizures and MRI lesions as well as the typical symptoms of brainstem involvement and pleocytosis. Eye involvement tended to be more severe in Group I, and the difference remained significant both when milder cases were excluded from the analysis (6 vs. 0; p=0.03) and when severe cases were excluded (p=0.04). pNBD was significantly more frequent in patients on cyclosporine alone than in those receiving cyclosporine plus another agent.
CONCLUSION: In patients with Behçet's uveitis, cyclosporine seems to be associated with an increased risk of developing pNBD, although the reason for this is unknown. A prospective trial is needed to shed light on this problem.",23,2008-1-1

NOD2 plays an important role in the recognition of intracellular bacteria through its ability to sense the components of bacterial peptidoglycan (PGN), namely muramyl dipeptide (MDP) and muramyl tripeptide (MTP). Specific mutations in the human NOD2 gene cause Blau syndrome, an autosomal dominant form of uveitis, arthritis, and dermatitis. As a first step toward understanding the role of NOD2 in the pathogenesis of uveitis, the authors developed a mouse model of MDP-dependent uveitis.
METHODS: BALB/c mice and mice deficient in L-selectin or NOD2 received intravitreal injection of MDP, MTP, or PGN. The intravascular response within the iris and cellular infiltration was quantified by intravital microscopy and histologic assessment.
RESULTS: MDP induced an acute, ocular inflammatory response, wherein rolling and adhering leukocytes within the vasculature were significantly increased within 6 hours after MDP treatment. A minor increase in cellular infiltration occurred at 12 hours after MDP treatment. The adhesion molecule L-selectin participated in MDP-induced vascular inflammation because L-selectin knockout mice showed a significant decrease in the number of rolling cells. Importantly, NOD2 plays an essential role in ocular inflammation induced by MDP, as indicated by the fact that uveitis did not develop in Nod2 knockout mice in response to MDP. Nod2 knockout mice also showed abolished ocular inflammation in response to MTP but not to PGN treatment.
CONCLUSIONS: These findings demonstrate a novel mouse model of uveitis, wherein NOD2 plays an essential role in inflammation induced by the minimal components of PGN. Thus, innate immune responses mediated by NOD2 may participate in the development of uveitis in response to bacterial products.",23,2008-Apr-1

The incidence of uveitis associated with juvenile idiopathic arthritis (JIA) varies around the world. Our aim was to investigate the incidence and predictors of uveitis in a Nordic population-based cohort.
METHODS: Consecutive JIA cases from defined geographical areas in Denmark, Finland, Sweden and Norway with disease onset between January 1997 to June 2000 were followed for median 98 months in this prospective longitudinal cohort study. Potential clinical and immunological predictors of uveitis were identified with logistic regression analysis.
RESULTS: Uveitis occurred in 89 (20.5%) of the 435 children with regular ophtalmologic follow-up among the 500 included. Chronic asymptomatic uveitis developed in 80 and acute symptomatic uveitis in 9 children. Uveitis developed at a median interval of 0.8 (range - 4.7 to 9.4) years after onset of arthritis. Predictors of uveitis were age < 7 years at JIA onset (Odds ratio (OR) 2.1, 95% confidence interval (CI) 1.3 to 3.5), presence of antihistone antibodies (AHA) > 15 U/ml (OR 4.8 (1.8 to 13.4)) and antinuclear antibodies (ANA) (OR 2.4 (1.5 to 4.0)). Mean combined IgM/IgG AHA was significantly higher in the uveitis group (19.2 U/ml) than in the non-uveitis group (10.2 U/ml) (p = 0.002). Young age at JIA onset predicted uveitis in girls (p < 0.001), but not in boys (p = 0.390).
CONCLUSION: Early-onset arthritis and presence of AHA in girls, as well as presence of ANA in both genders, were significant predictors of chronic uveitis. The high incidence of uveitis in this long-term Nordic JIA cohort may have severe implications in a lifelong perspective.",23,2017-Aug-18

IRU is the most common form of immune reconstitution inflammatory syndrome in HIV-infected patients with cytomegalovirus retinitis who are receiving highly active antiretroviral therapy (HAART). Among patients with CMV in the HAART era, immune recovery may be associated with a greater number of inflammatory complications, including macular edema and epiretinal membrane formation. Given the range of ocular manifestations of HIV, routine ocular examinations and screening for visual loss are recommended in patients with CD4 counts <50 cells/μL. With the increasing longevity of these patients due to the use of HAART, treatment of IRU may become an issue in the future. The aim of this paper is to review the current literature concerning immune recovery uveitis. The definition, epidemiology, pathophysiology, clinical findings, complications, diagnosis, and treatment are presented.",23,2014-1-1

Juvenile rheumatoid arthritis (JRA) is the systemic disease most frequently associated in childhood uveitis. The disease may cause several ocular complications, visual impairment, and blindness. Recent studies revealed a more favorable ocular prognosis. Our purpose was to analyze the long-term visual outcome of JRA-associated uveitis.
METHODS: Ocular complications and visual outcome in adult patients with JRA-associated uveitis were evaluated. Among 18 patients included in the study, uveitis was bilateral in 12 (66.7%) and unilateral in six (33.3%), for a total of 30 eyes with ocular involvement.
RESULTS: The mean durations of JRA and its associated uveitis were 24.9 and 20.5 years, respectively. All eyes (100%) had at least one ocular complication. The most frequently observed ocular complications were cataract (83.3%), band keratopathy (60%), posterior synechia (46.7%), glaucoma (33.3%), hypotony (16.7%), and macular pathology (13.3%). Final visual acuity was impaired in 40% of the eyes, poor in 20%, and totally lost in 10%. Therefore, 70% of the eyes were either visually handicapped or totally blind. Most eyes underwent at least one surgical procedure. Inflammation was active at last examination in 63.3% of eyes. All patients were still treated topically and with systemic NSAID. Sixty-one percent of the patients were using an immunosuppressive agent.
CONCLUSION: JRA-associated uveitis still has a severe course and blinding potential. Patients suffer from uveitis and its complications even during the adulthood period. However, because our series represents a more severe subset of the disease, the outcome may be poorer than that of some other outcome studies.",23,2005-Feb-1

Interleukin-6 (IL-6) was measured in the aqueous humor and serum of Lewis rats after single and repeated injections of endotoxin into the footpad. After a single injection, a rise in serum and aqueous-humor levels of IL-6 was seen after 2 and 16 hr, respectively. The highest aqueous-humor level of IL-6 was seen 20 hr postinjection and was tenfold that seen in the serum sample taken at the same time, suggesting intraocular synthesis of this cytokine. Four hours later the most active uveitis and the highest total aqueous-humor protein level were observed. Repeated injection of endotoxin still resulted in a moderate but significant systemic release of IL-6 but no detectable IL-6 in the aqueous humor and the absence of uveitis. Intravitreal injection of endotoxin-free human recombinant IL-6 (10-10(5) U) in rats resulted in uveitis, resembling the ocular response to endotoxin. There appeared to be a prozone effect regarding the total aqueous-humor protein concentration. The largest amount of aqueous-humor protein was seen in the eyes injected with 10(2) U of IL-6, but increasing concentrations of intravitreal IL-6 showed a corresponding decrease in protein levels. In the fellow saline-injected eyes, a clear consensual response was observed with regard to the extravasation of protein, although the uveitic grade in these eyes was low or zero. Repeated intravitreal injection of IL-6 resulted in ocular unresponsiveness in nine of 11 rats.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)",23,1991-Jan-1

To evaluate the effectiveness and safety of mycophenolate mofetil (MMF) as first-line therapy combined with systemic corticosteroids in initial-onset acute uveitis associated with Vogt-Koyanagi-Harada (VKH) disease.
METHODS: This prospective study included 38 patients (76 eyes). The main outcome measures were final visual acuity, corticosteroid-sparing effect, progression to chronic recurrent granulomatous uveitis and development of complications, particularly 'sunset glow fundus'.
RESULTS: The mean follow-up period was 37.0 ± 29.3 (range 9-120 months). Visual acuity of 20/20 was achieved by 93.4% of the eyes. Corticosteroid-sparing effect was achieved in all patients. The mean interval between starting treatment and tapering to 10 mg or less daily was 3.8 ± 1.3 months (range 3-7 months). Twenty-two patients (57.9%) discontinued treatment without relapse of inflammation. The mean time observed off of treatment was 28.1 ± 19.6 months (range 1-60 months). None of the eyes progressed to chronic recurrent granulomatous uveitis. The ocular complications encountered were glaucoma in two eyes (2.6%) and cataract in five eyes (6.6%). None of the eyes developed 'sunset glow fundus', and none of the patients developed any systemic adverse events associated with the treatment.
CONCLUSIONS: Use of MMF as first-line therapy combined with systemic corticosteroids in patients with initial-onset acute VKH disease prevents progression to chronic recurrent granulomatous inflammation and development of 'sunset glow fundus'.",23,2017-Feb-1

To describe frequency, types, and clinical outcomes of extrapulmonary disorders (EPDs) in foals in which Rhodococcus equi infection was diagnosed, and to identify factors determined at the time of admission that differentiated foals that developed EPDs from foals with R equi infection identified only in the lungs.
DESIGN: Retrospective case series.
ANIMALS: 150 foals aged 3 weeks to 6 months with a diagnosis of R equi infection.
PROCEDURES: Medical records were reviewed for information on date of admission, signalment, history, clinical signs, diagnostic testing, treatment, duration of hospitalization, invoice, and outcome. For each EPD identified, further information was collected on the identification, location, treatment, and outcome of the lesion.
RESULTS: Of 150 foals with R equi infections, 111 (74%) had at least 1 of 39 EPDs. Survival was significantly higher among foals without EPDs (32/39 [82%]) than among foals with EPDs (48/111 [43%]), but many EPDs were only recognized after death. Risk factors significantly associated with EPDs included referral status, duration of clinical signs prior to admission, leukocytosis, and neutrophilia. Foals with EPDs also had a higher heart rate and BUN concentration than foals without.
CONCLUSIONS AND CLINICAL RELEVANCE: Practitioners should recognize that extrapulmonary manifestations of R equi occur with high prevalence affecting diverse organ systems, that multiple systems are generally affected when EPDs occur, and that suspicion of R equi infection should prompt evaluation and monitoring of extrapulmonary sites. Improved recognition of the presence of these disorders will help practitioners to better advise their clients in the treatment and outcome of foals with R equi infections.",22,2009-Oct-01

To investigate the anti-inflammatory impacts of piroxicam nanosuspension, in the current investigation, piroxicam:Eudragit RS100 nanoformulations were used to control inflammatory symptoms in the rabbits with endotoxin-induced uveitis (EIU). The nanoparticles of piroxicam:Eudragit RS100 was formulated using the solvent evaporation/extraction technique. The morphological and physicochemical characteristics of nanoparticles were studied using particle size analysis, X-ray crystallography, differential scanning calorimetry (DSC), Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FT-IR) and scanning electron microscopy (SEM). Drug release profiles were examined by fitting the data to the most common kinetic models. Selected nanosuspensions were used to assess the anti-inflammatory impacts of piroxicam nanoparticles in the rabbits with EIU. The major symptoms of EIU (i.e. inflammation and leukocytes numbers in the aqueous humor) were examined. All the prepared piroxicam formulations using Eudragit RS100 resulted in a nano-range size particles and displayed spherical smooth morphology with positively charged surface, however, the formulated particles of drug alone using same methodology failed to manifest such characteristics. The Eudragit RS100 containing nanoparticles displayed lower crystallinity than piroxicam with no chemical interactions between the drug and polymer molecules. Kinetically, the release profiles of piroxicam from nanoparticles appeared to fit best with the Weibull model and diffusion was the superior phenomenon. The in vivo examinations revealed that the inflammation can be inhibited by the drug:polymer nanosuspension more significantly than the microsuspension of drug alone in the rabbits with EIU. Upon these findings, we propose that the piroxicam:Eudragit RS100 nanosuspensions may be considered as an improved ocular delivery system for locally inhibition of inflammation.",22,2007-Jul-1

To analyze clinical patterns, causes, and systemic disease associations among patients with uveitis admitted to King Abdulaziz University Hospital.
METHODS: The authors retrospectively reviewed the medical records of 351 patients (600 eyes).
RESULTS: The study subjects consisted of 183 (52.1%) males and 168 (47.9%) females, with a mean age of 39.9 ± 14.2 years at presentation. The most common anatomic diagnosis was panuveitis (68.6%), followed by posterior uveitis (12.7%), anterior uveitis (12.7%), and intermediate uveitis (6.0%). The most common identifiable specific diagnoses were presumed tuberculous uveitis (PTU) (28.2%), Vogt-Koyanagi-Harada (VKH) disease (19.4%), Behçet disease (BD) (12.5%), and toxoplasmosis (8.2%). After a mean follow-up period of 29.5 ± 22.1 months, 63.5% of the eyes achieved visual acuity of 20/40 or better. Eyes from patients with PTU had the worst final visual outcome.
CONCLUSIONS: The most common anatomic diagnosis was panuveitis. PTU, VKH disease, BD, and toxoplasmosis were the most frequent specific diagnoses.",22,2010-Dec-1

Several studies have shown the capacity of interferon-alpha (IFN-alpha) to control ocular Behçet disease. The authors aimed to determine whether IFN-alpha was effective in treating patients with severe, refractory sight-threatening intraocular inflammation (uveitis) from a wider range of causes, including Behçet disease.
DESIGN: Prospective, interventional case series.
METHODS: Twelve patients with sight-threatening uveitis that failed to respond to one or more immunosuppressive regimens were enrolled to this study. Recombinant human IFN-alpha-2b was administered subcutaneously daily, and the dose was adjusted according to the clinical response. Main outcome measures were visual acuity, clinical activity of uveitis (including binocular indirect ophthalmoscopy [BIO] score and presence or absence of macular edema), and adverse effects of the treatment.
RESULTS: The mean observation period was 11 months (range, one to 29 months). A positive clinical response was observed in 83% of patients. Median visual acuity improved from 0.54 to 0.2 (logarithm of the minimum angle of resolution units; P < .001) and median BIO score decreased from 1.0 to 0.5 (P < .05) within one month of treatment. Macular edema, if present, resolved in all patients within days of treatment. The main adverse events were tiredness, lymphopenia, flu-like symptoms, and transient increase of liver enzymes. Weight loss occurred in four patients. Four patients experienced depression, one of them attempting suicide. Three patients experienced typical features of IFN-alpha-associated retinopathy, which resolved on reducing the dose.
CONCLUSIONS: IFN-alpha seems to have significant potential in treatment of severe, sight-threatening refractory uveitis from a variety of causes. A range of adverse events, including IFN-alpha-associated retinopathy, may occur and could limit the use of this immunomodulatory drug.",22,2007-Jul-1

Uveitis is an inflammatory disorder involving inflammation of the uveal tract. It is classified as anterior, intermediate, posterior or panuveitis, depending on the part of eye affected by the inflammatory process. In children, non-infectious, chronic uveitis is a relatively uncommon but serious disease, with the potential for significant long-term complications and possible blindness. Although frequently associated with an underlying systemic disease, e.g. juvenile idiopathic arthritis (JIA), a significant number of cases in children show no associated signs or symptoms, and are labelled as idiopathic. Taking into account this evidence, an anti-inflammatory therapy based on an immuno-modulatory approach seems a reasonable strategy for non-infectious chronic uveitis, in children as well as in adults. Due to a lack of controlled studies regarding uveitis in children, immunosuppressive drugs are supported only at evidence level III. The aim of this review is to report currently available medical strategies for treatment of childhood sight-threatening chronic uveitis; in addition, a step-by-step approach to the use of immunosuppressants in this context is suggested.",22,2010-Aug-1

The etiologic evaluation of uveitis is frequently unsuccessful when noninvasive methods are used. We conducted a prospective study to evaluate systematic screening for pathogens of uveitis. All patients with uveitis referred to the participating tertiary ophthalmology departments from January 2001 to September 2007 underwent intraocular and serum specimen collection. The standardized protocol for laboratory investigations included universal polymerase chain reaction (PCR)-based detection of any bacteria and mycoses, specific PCR-based detection of fastidious (difficult-to-grow) bacteria and herpes viruses, and culture of vitreous fluid. Sera were tested for fastidious bacteria. Among the 1321 included patients (1520 specimens), infection was diagnosed in 147 (11.1%) patients: 78 (53%) were caused by fastidious bacteria that included spirochetes, Bartonella species, intracellular bacteria (Chlamydia species, Rickettsia species, Coxiella burnetii), and Tropheryma whipplei; 18 by herpes viruses; and 9 by fungi. Bartonella quintana, Coxiella burnetii, Paracoccus yeei, Aspergillus oryzae, and Cryptococcus albidus were found to be associated with uveitis for the first time, to our knowledge. We recommend applying a 1-step diagnostic procedure that incorporates intraocular, specific microbial PCR with serum analyses in tertiary centers to determine the etiology of uveitis.",22,2008-May-1

To evaluate the prevalence of secondary glaucoma (SG), clinical forms of uveitis more frequently associated with glaucoma, and describe the treatment and complications encountered in a cohort of patients with glaucoma and uveitis during a 10-year period.
METHODS: The hospital records of patients with uveitis referred to the Immunology Service of the Massachusetts Eye and Ear Infirmary for a decade were reviewed for cases of SG.
RESULTS: One hundred and twenty of the 1,254 patients (9.6%) with uveitis developed SG. SG was more frequent in anterior uveitis (67%) but was also associated with posterior uveitis (13%) and pars planitis (4%). Herpetic keratouveitis (22%), Fuchs' iridocyclitis (19%), juvenile rheumatoid arthritis-associated iridocyclitis (16%), syphilis (14%), and sarcoidosis (12%) were the leading types of uveitis associated with SG. Despite aggressive medical and surgical therapy, SG was associated with progressive visual field loss and optic nerve damage in 39 patients (33%).
CONCLUSION: SG is an underappreciated, vision-threatening complication in patients with uveitis. Increased vigilance for emergence of this complicating problem during the care of patients with uveitis is warranted, and medical and surgical treatment for reducing IOP should be especially aggressive in these patients. We hypothesize that earlier, more aggressive treatment of uveitis will reduce the presence of glaucoma as an additional vision-robbing complication of uveitis.",22,1999-1-1

METHODS: Retrospective chart review at three tertiary ophthalmology clinics. Electronic medical records were reviewed between 2000 and 2017 for patients with new ocular symptoms while undergoing checkpoint inhibition therapy.
RESULTS: Eleven patients were identified. Ocular irAEs ranged from keratoconjunctivitis sicca to Vogt-Koyanagi-Harada-like findings. Average timing of irAEs from starting checkpoint inhibitor therapy was 15.7 weeks. Ocular inflammation was successfully controlled with corticosteroids in most cases, however three patients discontinue treatment as a result of ocular inflammation with decreased visual acuity, two discontinued due to progression of metastatic disease, and one discontinued due to severe systemic irAEs.
CONCLUSION: We found a wide spectrum of ocular irAEs associated with immune checkpoint inhibitors. In most cases, ocular AEs did not limit ongoing cancer treatment.",22,2020-Aug-17

Vogt-Koyanagi-Harada (VKH) syndrome is a rare condition implicating systemic immune reaction against melanocytes. The pathophysiology is unclear. A genetic predisposition has been suggested as HLA-DR4/DRB1*04 is more common among VKH patients. Drug induced VKH syndrome has been reported in advanced melanoma patients receiving immunotherapy, including ipilimumab and adoptive cell transfer of Tumor-Infiltrating Lymphocyte associated with IL-2. To date, no case of anti PD-1 -induced VKH syndrome has been described. We report here the case of a HLA-DR4/DRB1*04 patient successfully treated with anti PD-1 for advanced melanoma who developed a systemic immune reaction against melanocytes for whom we discuss a VKH-like syndrome diagnosis in a potentially genetically predisposed patient.",22,2017-1-1

The exact pathogenic mechanisms involved in autoimmune and inflammatory eye diseases are not known. However, studies during the past few years indicate that a T cell infiltrate, T cell sensitization to retinal antigens and expression of major histocompatibility complex (MHC) class II antigens are associated with this process. In this report we show that the lymphokines, IL-2 and IFN-gamma, are present in the human eye during inflammatory and autoimmune diseases. The presence of these lymphokines is associated with a lymphocyte infiltrate, predominantly of T cell origin, and with the expression of MHC class II antigens on both the infiltrating cells and ocular resident cells, that is, retinal pigment epithelial (rpe) cells and retinal vascular endothelial cells. Furthermore, in vitro studies demonstrate that IFN-gamma can enhance the expression of the HLA-DR determinant on both of these cell types. These observations suggest that lymphokine induced class II antigen expression may serve as a local amplification system in autoimmune and inflammatory eye diseases. A better understanding of the role of lymphokines in the mechanisms involved in the development of autoimmunity and inflammation may be beneficial in the treatment of these diseases.",22,1988-Sep-1

Over the last decade ocular involvement due to tuberculosis has re-emerged. In non-endemic areas the low frequency of active tuberculosis is at the origin of an underestimation of the disease. The purpose of this study is to report a group of patients with presumed tuberculous uveitis and to analyse the pre-diagnostic course, the diagnostic delay and the evolution of ocular inflammation after diagnosis and anti-tuberculous treatment.
METHODS: Criteria for presumed tuberculous uveitis included the presence of a hyperpositive tuberculin skin test with compatible uveitis and the exclusion of other possible etiologies.
RESULTS: Thirty-five patients fulfilled the diagnostic criteria for presumed tuberculous uveitis and were included in the study. The diagnosis was performed at presentation in only seven patients, while the correct diagnosis was delayed in the other 30 patients. The mean diagnostic delay was 5.7 +/- 4 years. Anti-tuberculous therapy was given for a minimum of 6 to a maximum of 24 months. Post-diagnostic mean follow-up was 30.4 +/- 13.4 months. Anti-tuberculous therapy resulted in a highly significant increase in visual acuity, from 0.53 to 0.78 (P < 0.001), a highly significant decrease of recurrences, from 100 to 10% (P < 0.001), with only three recurrences observed during the follow-up, and a highly significant decrease in intra-ocular pressure, from 18.3 to 13.7 (P < 0.001).
CONCLUSIONS: Our study tends to confirm the existence of tuberculous uveitis and supports the validity of the proposed diagnostic criteria. Recognition of the correct diagnosis and specific therapy, even with substantial delay, avoids recurrences, improves visual acuity and intra-ocular inflammation and decreases intra-ocular pressure.",22,2009-Apr-1

PARTICIPANTS: Five patients who used oral moxifloxacin therapy.
MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: In five patients, a uveitis-like episode followed oral moxifloxacin therapy, afterwards they experienced photophobia. At slitlamp investigation, the patients showed almost complete iris transillumination, not restricted to one sector, and persistent mydriasis of the pupil, with no reaction to light and no near reflex. Follow-up of 3 years in one of the patients showed no change of symptoms. Only in one patient, with a history of anterior uveitis, an anterior chamber tap was positive for herpes simplex genome. Only after the use of moxifloxacin did she experience continuous photophobia.

Noninfectious uveitis encompasses a diverse group of ocular inflammatory disorders that share an underlying immune etiology and may be associated with systemic disease or confined primarily to the eye. Uveitis is commonly classified by anatomical location of inflammation into anterior, intermediate, posterior, and panuveitis. The treatment of noninfectious uveitis consists of corticosteroids, immunosuppressive agents, and surgically placed steroid implants. We review the epidemiology, immunopathology, and clinical features of several noninfectious immune-mediated uveitides, including HLA-B27 acute anterior uveitis, juvenile idiopathic arthritis, intermediate uveitis, sarcoidosis, Behcet's disease, Vogt-Koyanagi-Harada syndrome, sympathetic ophthalmia, and white dot syndromes. We also discuss the stepwise approach to medical treatment of immune-mediated uveitis as well as the characteristics, safety, and efficacy of immunosuppressive agents used to treat ocular inflammatory disease.",22,2014-Jan-1

A highly selective technique of polymerase chain reaction (PCR) was performed for detection of Mycobacterium tuberculosis from aqueous samples of 45 patients to evaluate its role in initiating antituberculosis treatment in patients with presumed intraocular tuberculosis.
METHODS: Forty-five patients were divided into three groups. Group I included 17 patients of presumed intraocular tuberculosis, group II 13 disease controls and group III had 15 normal controls. Patients with positive PCR were offered antituberculosis chemotherapy and followed up for a minimum of 18 months.
RESULTS: Ten patients in group I, 3 in group II and none in group III were positive for Mycobacterium tuberculosis by PCR. Ten patients with positive PCR for Mycobacterium tuberculosis (8 in group I and 2 in group II) were treated with antituberculosis chemotherapy and all showed resolution of inflammation without any recurrence over 18 months of follow-up. Two PCR positive patients treated with steroids alone, however, did not show complete resolution and had recurrent attacks.
CONCLUSION: These results suggest that antituberculosis treatment in PCR positive patients leads to resolution of inflammation and elimination of recurrences, most likely by eliminating Mycobacterium tuberculosis from the intraocular tissues.",22,1998-Dec-1

To describe the demographic and clinical features, complications, treatment, and visual results in patients with childhood-onset Behçet uveitis.
DESIGN: Observational case series.
METHODS: A retrospective study was made of 36 consecutive patients with Behçet disease seen at the Uveitis Service, Department of Ophthalmology, Istanbul Faculty of Medicine, Istanbul University, between January 1975 and January 2002. Inclusion criteria were fulfillment of the classification criteria of the International Study Group for Behçet Disease and onset of uveitis at 16 years of age or younger. The medical records of 36 patients with childhood-onset Behçet uveitis were reviewed. The main outcome measures were sex, age at onset of uveitis, the initial symptom of Behçet disease, clinical ocular features, ocular complications, systemic treatment, complications of treatment, and final visual acuity.
RESULTS: Twenty-five patients were male, 11 were female. Mean age at onset of uveitis was 13.6 years. The initial symptom was oral ulcer in 63.8% of the patients. The majority of patients (83.3%) had bilateral involvement. Panuveitis was the most common form (86.2%). Retinal vasculitis and retinitis were the most common ocular findings seen in 83.3% and 68.2% of the involved eyes, respectively. Cataract, maculopathy, and optic atrophy were the most common complications seen in 46.9%, 45.4%, and 39.4% of the involved eyes, respectively. Immunosuppressive therapy was administered to 75% of the patients. Response to treatment was variable. The most common complications of systemic treatment were associated with corticosteroid therapy. Final visual acuity was worse than 0.1 in 22.7% of the involved eyes.
CONCLUSIONS: Childhood-onset Behçet uveitis was more common among males. Bilateral panuveitis with retinal vasculitis and retinitis was the most common form of ocular involvement, similar to the adult patient. The treatment is challenging, as the use oral corticosteroids is associated with significant complications and the response to conventional immunosuppressive therapy is variable.",22,2003-Dec-1

Equine recurrent uveitis (ERU) is a leading cause of vision loss in horses.
OBJECTIVES: To assess the prognosis and impact of ERU on affected horses and their owners by evaluating the signalment, treatment and outcome (including the loss of use, vision assessment and economic loss).
STUDY DESIGN: Retrospective impact study.
METHODS: Medical records of horses presenting to the North Carolina State University Veterinary Health Complex (NCSU-VHC) with ERU between 1999 and 2014 were reviewed. Signalment, clinical signs, ophthalmic examination findings, treatments and outcomes were evaluated. Owner questionnaires were completed regarding vision, job/role, monetary value, diagnostic and treatment costs, concurrent illness and outcomes.
RESULTS: Records of 224 horses (338 eyes) with ERU were reviewed. There was an overrepresentation of Appaloosas (54; 24.1%), Hanoverians (11; 4.9%) and other Warmbloods (13; 5.8%). Ninety-six eyes (28.4%) were diagnosed as blind and 38 eyes (11.2%) with glaucoma on initial evaluation. Leptospirosis titres of serum and/or aqueous humour were obtained in 88 horses and were positive in 40 horses (45.5%), with L. pomona being the most frequently isolated serovar. Globe loss at the NCSU-VHC occurred in 41 ERU eyes (12.1% of total). Owner questionnaires were evaluated in 194 horses (86.6%) and 91 horses (46.9%) were reported blind in the affected eye(s). Fifty-seven horses (29.4%) did not return to their previous role, while 61 (31.4%) performed at a reduced level. Equine recurrent uveitis decreased the monetary value of 164 horses. Twenty-nine horses (14.9%) were euthanised and 37 (19.1%) underwent change in ownership as a direct result of ERU.
CONCLUSIONS: The impact of ERU is attributed to the high frequency of blindness, globe loss and loss of function. Euthanasia and change of ownership are common sequelae to the progressive nature of ERU. These factors, along with financial costs of the disease, have a significant impact on affected horses and their owners.",22,2016-May-1

Ligands for aryl hydrocarbon receptor (AHR), such as dioxins, are highly toxic. One such ligand, TCDD, was found to exert potent immunosuppressive capacities in mice developing pathogenic autoimmune processes, including EAU, but its toxicity makes it unusable for humans. A recently identified endogenous AHR ligand, ITE, is also immunosuppressive, but is nontoxic and could therefore be useful for therapy in humans. Here, we tested ITE for its capacity to inhibit EAU and related immune responses.
METHODS: EAU was induced in B10.A mice by immunization with interphotoreceptor retinoid-binding protein (IRBP; 40 μg) in CFA. Treatment with ITE was by daily intraperitoneal injection of 0.2 mg. Disease severity was assessed by both fundoscopy and histological examination. Draining lymph node cells were tested for proliferation by thymidine uptake and for cytokine production and release by ELISA. In addition, the intracellular expression of cytokines and Foxp3 was determined by flow cytometry. Serum antibodies were measured by ELISA.
RESULTS: Treatment with ITE efficiently inhibited the development of EAU in mice, as well as the cellular immune responses against IRBP and PPD. ITE treatment inhibited the expansion of both Th1 and Th17 subpopulations, as well as their release of the signature cytokines, IFN-gamma and IL-17. The treatment moderately increased, however, the proportion of Foxp3 expressing T-regulatory cells. Antibody production was not affected by the treatment.
CONCLUSIONS: ITE, an endogenous AHR ligand, efficiently inhibits EAU development and related cellular immune responses. Being nontoxic, ITE may be considered for treatment of pathogenic immunity in humans.",22,2013-Nov-13

To evaluate the accuracy of QuantiFERON-TB Gold testing in patients with presumptive tuberculosis-ocular inflammation.
DESIGN: Prospective nonrandomized case series and clinical laboratory investigation.
METHODS: Ninety-six consecutive patients presenting with ocular inflammation between January and October 2007 were tested using QuantiFERON-TB Gold. Positive patients received a 6-month anti-tuberculosis treatment. Patient follow-up ranged from 12 months to 24 months. Treatment was considered effective at the end of follow-up, in cases of no or a 2-point decrease of ocular inflammation (SUN criteria) and systemic corticosteroids stopped or tapered to 10 mg/day.
RESULTS: Mean age was 51 ± 17 years. Types of ocular inflammation included scleritis (n = 7), panuveitis (n = 34), and posterior (n = 15), intermediate (n = 14), and anterior uveitis (n = 15). QuantiFERON-TB Gold was positive in 42 cases (44%), negative in 51 cases (53%), and undetermined in 3 cases (3%). Among positive QuantiFERON-TB Gold patients, 25 received a full anti-tuberculosis treatment, which was effective in 15 cases (60%). Associated systemic steroids were given to 6 patients and tapered to 10 mg/day or less in all cases. Median QuantiFERON-TB Gold value was significantly higher in the group with a successful therapeutic response (7.67 IU/mL [0.46 to 33.37]) compared to the group with treatment failure (1.22 IU/mL [0.61 to 4.4]), P = .026.
CONCLUSION: Results of anti-tuberculosis treatment were encouraging in QuantiFERON-TB Gold-positive ocular inflammation, especially with values over 2 IU/mL in our study, suggesting that a higher cut-off value than that given by the manufacturer should be considered to better identify ocular inflammation that can benefit from full anti-tuberculosis treatment.",22,2011-Sep-1

Intermediate uveitis (IU) and Fuchs' heterochromic cyclitis (FHC) are two chronic ocular inflammatory disorders. They differ considerably in ocular morbidity, which is higher in IU. T cell lines were derived from the vitreous humour (VH) and peripheral blood (PB) of 10 patients with IU and four patients with FHC. There was a predominance of CD8+ in all the lines. However, there was a significantly higher percentage of CD4+ T cells in the T cell lines derived from VH of IU (32.0 +/- 8.6%) compared with FHC patients (19. 2 +/- 8.9%) (P = 0.04). The VH-derived T cell lines (VDTC) produced significantly higher levels of IL-2, interferon-gamma (IFN-gamma) and IL-10, but not IL-4, compared with PB-derived T cell lines (PBDTC) in both entities. There was significantly higher IL-2 production by VDTC from IU when compared with FHC patients (1810 +/- 220 pg/ml versus 518 +/- 94 pg/ml; P = 0.009), which could account for the more aggressive clinical features of this condition. In contrast IL-10 production was significantly higher by the VDTC from FHC compared with IU patients. The high IL-10 production by T cells infiltrating VH of FHC patients could down-regulate the inflammatory responses, thereby contributing to the benign clinical course seen in these patients. The accumulation of T cells with differing cytokine profiles in the VH suggests an important role for these cytokines in the pathogenesis of these chronic uveitides.",22,1999-Jun-1

IgG4-related disease is a multi-organ fibro-inflammatory disease with characteristic histopathology showing lymphoplasmacytic infiltration, increased IgG4+ plasma cells and elevated IgG4/IgG ratios (>40%). The lacrimal gland is the most common ocular site of involvement. Scleritis and intraocular involvement in IgG4-related ophthalmic disease (IgG4-ROD) have recently been reported. The purpose of this review is to describe orbital and intraocular IgG4-ROD with a focus on publications since 2016.
RECENT FINDINGS: Case reports of scleritis and uveitis in IgG4-ROD have been described since 2012. Systemic prednisone is recommended as the first-line treatment, but immunosuppressive therapy may be required for steroid-sparing or in steroid-resistant cases. High rates of systemic IgG4-RD involvement exist in patients with bilateral IgG4-ROD or if the lacrimal gland is involved. Rituximab is the most specific immune targeted therapy available with high rates of remission.
SUMMARY: IgG4-ROD is an emerging cause of scleritis and uveitis and should be considered in any patient with multisystem inflammatory disease. New targeted immune therapies may improve outcomes and lead to clinical remission.",22,2017-Nov-1

To describe the effectiveness of periocular corticosteroid injections in the treatment of cystoid macular edema (CME) complicating noninfectious uveitis.
DESIGN: Retrospective cohort study.
METHODS: A total of 126 patients (156 eyes) were evaluated for presence of CME, visual acuity, intraocular pressure, degree of intraocular inflammation, and the presence of ocular complications. Main outcome measures included resolution of CME and visual acuity at the 1- and 3-month visits, failure of periocular injection therapy, and side effects.
RESULTS: Twenty-eight percent of the 156 eyes had anterior uveitis, 22% intermediate uveitis, and 31% panuveitis. Of these eyes, 53% demonstrated clinical resolution of CME at 1 month and 57% at 3 months after a single periocular corticosteroid injection. Forty eyes were treated with >1 periocular injection because the CME persisted 1 month after the first injection (1 additional injection in 21 eyes; 2 additional injections in 14 eyes; >2 additional injections in 5 eyes). For the 21 eyes treated with a second periocular corticosteroid injection, 81% had no CME 1 month after the second injection and 48% had no CME 3 months after the second injection. Twenty-three eyes (15%) failed periocular corticosteroid therapy. Of eyes initially responding to periocular injection, CME recurred in 53% (median time to recurrence = 20.2 weeks). A halving of the visual angle was observed in 52% and 57% at the 1- and 3-month visits after injection, respectively.
CONCLUSIONS: Fifty-three percent of eyes treated with a single periocular corticosteroid injection had clinical resolution of CME 1 month after the injection.",22,2011-Sep-1

To describe the distribution pattern and the clinical features of uveitis in two ophthalmology referral centres in Colombia.
METHODS: This was a retrospective study in which clinical records of patients attending the centres between 1996 and 2006 were systematically reviewed. Data were analysed and compared with previous reports.
RESULTS: Uveitis was found in 693 patients: 335 men (48.3%) and 358 women (51.7%). The mean age for the first presentation was 31.7 +/- 18.3 years. Unilateral (73.4%), acute (68.3%), posterior (35.9%) and non-granulomatous (90.6%) were the most common types of uveitis found in the sample. Toxoplasmosis was the most frequent cause in this study followed in order by idiopathic and toxocariasis. Vogt-Koyanagi-Harada, Behçet's disease, sarcoidosis and white dot syndromes were less common. Some causes such as systemic lupus erythematosus and tuberculosis were extremely rare. Presumed ocular histoplasmosis, onchocerciasis and Lyme disease were absent.
CONCLUSIONS: The results of this study provide the first report of clinical patterns for uveitis in Colombia. This study will enhance awareness of uveitis, and data should assist in the development of public health policies in our population for the improvement of patient outcomes.",22,2009-Jul-1

Based on a nationwide database, this study analyzed the influence of methotrexate (MTX), tumor necrosis factor (TNF) inhibitors, and a combination of the 2 medications on uveitis occurrence in juvenile idiopathic arthritis (JIA) patients.
METHODS: Data from the National Paediatric Rheumatological Database in Germany were used in this study. Between 2002 and 2013, data from JIA patients were annually documented at the participating pediatric rheumatologic sites. Patients with a JIA disease duration of <12 months at initial documentation and ≥2 years of followup were included in this study. The impact of antiinflammatory treatment on the occurrence of uveitis was evaluated by discrete-time survival analysis.
RESULTS: A total of 3,512 JIA patients (mean ± SD age 8.3 ± 4.8 years, 65.7% female, 53.2% antinuclear antibody positive, and mean ± SD age at arthritis onset 7.8 ± 4.8 years) fulfilled the inclusion criteria. Mean ± SD total followup time was 3.6 ± 2.4 years. Uveitis developed in a total of 180 patients (5.1%) within 1 year after arthritis onset. Uveitis onset after the first year was observed in another 251 patients (7.1%). Disease-modifying antirheumatic drug (DMARD) treatment in the year before uveitis onset significantly reduced the risk for uveitis as follows: MTX: hazard ratio (HR) 0.63, P = 0.022; TNF inhibitors: HR 0.56, P < 0.001; and a combination of the 2 medications: HR 0.10, P < 0.001. Patients treated with MTX within the first year of JIA had an even a lower uveitis risk (HR 0.29, P < 0.001).
CONCLUSION: The use of DMARDs in JIA patients significantly reduced the risk for uveitis onset. Early MTX use within the first year of disease and the combination of MTX with a TNF inhibitor had the highest protective effect.",22,2016-Jan-1

To present the manifestations of syphilitic uveitis in Chinese patients.
METHODS: This is a retrospective case series of 35 eyes of 19 patients with syphilitic uveitis. The data of these patients including complaints, ocular and systemic manifestations, human immunodeficiency virus status, results of auxiliary examinations, treatment, and follow-up were reviewed.
RESULTS: Nineteen consecutive Chinese patients were diagnosed with syphilitic uveitis by serologic tests. Four patients had circulating human immunodeficiency virus antibodies. Ocular involvement was found in 35 eyes. Posterior segment involvement was found in 30 eyes of 17 patients (85.7%), whereas anterior segment involvement was found in 14 eyes of 8 patients (40.0%). Thirty eyes of 17 patients (85.7%) presented with vitreous opacities and 28 eyes of 16 patients (80.0%) with retinitis. Papillitis and retinal vasculitis were found in 10 eyes of 6 patients (28.6%) and 7 eyes of 4 patients (20.0%), respectively. Multiple precipitates on the retina and posterior vitreous membrane were observed in six eyes of three patients. A large iris granuloma was observed in one eye.
CONCLUSION: Posterior uveitis was the most common ocular finding in these investigated Chinese patients with syphilis. Coinfection of syphilis and human immunodeficiency virus was less common in these patients. Syphilis should be considered in the differential diagnosis of patients presenting with large iris granulomas.",22,2012-Oct-1

To present the clinical and histopathologic findings in five cases of tuberculosis (TB) with various ocular manifestations.
DESIGN: Observational case series.
METHODS: Retrospective review of clinical findings, course, and treatment of five patients. Diagnostic techniques, including biomicroscopic, histopathologic, and molecular biologic test results, are presented.
MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Visual acuity, slit-lamp biomicroscopy, indirect ophthalmoscopy, and fluorescein angiography results.
RESULTS: The ocular manifestations of TB in our patients included panophthalmitis, endophthalmitis, posterior uveitis with choroidal tubercles, keratitis, and a lid mass. Mycobacterium tuberculosis was identified in four cases in ocular specimens using acid-fast bacilli microscopy and in three cases by culture. Rapid diagnosis using polymerase chain reaction was obtained in one case. Extraocular foci of TB were identified in three cases with an intraocular infection at presentation. No patients had the human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) and none were immunocompromised. Two eyes could not be saved using antituberculous treatment because of delayed diagnosis and treatment.
CONCLUSIONS: In this age of the HIV pandemic, TB is becoming more common. Because it is curable, heightened awareness and better understanding of the disease's ocular manifestations should be of concern to all ophthalmologists.",22,2001-Sep-1

Publication Date: 1997-Jun-1
PMID: 9191596
Results of a previous study demonstrated the presence of superoxide and nitric oxide in experimental autoimmune uveitis (EAU). These two chemical entities have recently been shown to combine rapidly to form one of the most potent known biologic oxidants, peroxynitrite. As an extension of the previous study, the current study was proposed to determine whether peroxynitrite is generated in EAU and the site and extent of any oxidative damage thereby inflicted.
METHODS: Experimental uveitis was induced in Lewis rats with retinal S-antigen. The localization of peroxynitrite was carried out by immunohistochemical detection of its nitration product, nitrotyrosine, using polyclonal rabbit antinitrotyrosine antibody. The lipid peroxides in the membrane were detected by fluorescent labeling of their secondary carbonyl products with 3-hydroxy-2-naphthoic acid hydrazide. This fluorescent product was also visualized by coupling with Fast Blue B. A confocal laser scanning microscope was used for detection.
RESULTS: In EAU, the peroxynitrite plaques were observed to concentrate in the photoreceptors but were also visible in some inner retinal areas, including ganglion cell layers, nerve fiber layers, and retinal blood vessels. The lipid peroxides were localized exclusively in the photoreceptors, concentrating in the vicinity of the infiltrating phagocytes but not localized on the phagocytic cells themselves. Similar peroxide lesions in the photoreceptors were also generated by aerobically exposing the naive, open eyecups to a radical generator, 2,2'azobis(2-amidinopropane) hydrochloride.
CONCLUSIONS: In EAU, there was a substantial concentration of peroxynitrite in the photoreceptors. The presence of this oxidant appears to correlate with the pathologic oxidation demonstrated in this area. The photoreceptors are especially prone to radical-induced lipid peroxidation caused by the high concentration of docasahexaenoic acid that is contained in these structures.",22,1997-Jun-1

Infliximab is a murine-human recombinant antitumour necrosis factor monoclonal antibody recently introduced for the treatment of autoimmune diseases in which tumour necrosis factor is thought to be a key mediator. Its role in the treatment of juvenile idiopathic arthritis-associated uveitis is as yet undefined.
METHODS: Six children with juvenile idiopathic arthritis-associated uveitis, inadequately controlled on currently available therapy, were treated with infliximab between September 2002 and November 2004. All children were required to remain on low-dose immunomodulatory treatment in conjunction with the infliximab. A retrospective review of two electronic databases containing details of ophthalmology and rheumatology visits was conducted.
RESULTS: In all six children, institution of infliximab therapy was associated with increased ease of management. Ocular inflammation and intraocular pressure control improved in all. It was also possible to reduce the dose or withdraw some glaucoma, steroid and other immunomodulatory drugs. Two children underwent intraocular surgery without noticeable flare of intraocular inflammation. No patient developed any serious systemic complications attributable to infliximab.
CONCLUSION: Infliximab may be a useful adjunct to the management of refractory juvenile idiopathic arthritis-associated uveitis. In our series it was associated with improved uveitis control and simplification of drug use as well as possibly improving safety of surgical intervention. This study suggests that its role is likely to be in conjunction with maintenance immunomodulatory treatment to provide more optimal disease control. Controlled studies are required to confirm its efficacy and safety, and the potential breadth of its use in uveitis and related disorders.",22,2005-Oct-1

Cataracts are known to develop at an accelerated rate in many forms of uveitis. Until recently, cataract surgery in such eyes was regarded as a hazardous procedure that yielded unpredictable and often discouraging results. Recent evidence from a number of reports suggests that newer surgical techniques and careful medical management allow a significant number of patients with uveitis to undergo cataract extraction successfully. Intraocular lens implantation using in-the-bag posterior chamber lens technique has been successful in selected cases. Careful patient selection, coupled with the use of an appropriate surgical technique, appear to be of major importance. Herein we review the current literature on cataract extraction in uveitis and provide guidelines for patient and technique selection based on the type of inflammation present. The management of common surgical problems and complications is discussed, as is the role of the intraocular lens. Specific surgical techniques useful in the management of eyes with cataract and uveitis are discussed.",22,1990-1-1

T helper 17 cells (Th17) are one of the main pathogenic effectors in autoimmune uveitis, and IL-17A is the signature cytokine of Th17 cells. This study aims to assess serum IL-17A levels in patients with autoimmune uveitis and evaluate associations between IL-17A levels and disease characteristics.
METHODS: Serum IL-17A levels from 87 autoimmune uveitis patients and 60 healthy controls were assessed using an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. Among this cohort, 9 patients were followed longitudinally for IL-17A levels during active and inactive stages of their disease.
RESULTS: Median serum IL-17A levels were higher among uveitis patients compared to controls (p < 0.0001). Moreover, IL-17A levels were elevated among uveitis patients with active disease compared to those with inactive disease (p = 0.0202). Among the 9 patients followed longitudinally, IL-17A levels were elevated during active disease compared to the inactive stage (p = 0.0078).
CONCLUSIONS: Serum IL-17A levels are elevated in uveitis patients, particularly in active uveitis.",22,2013-Dec-1

Experimental autoimmune uveitis (EAU) is a predominantly Th1-mediated intraocular inflammatory disease that serves as a model for studying the immunopathogenic mechanisms of uveitis and organ-specific autoimmune diseases. Despite the well-documented role of IFN-gamma in the activation of inflammatory cells that mediate autoimmune pathology, recent studies in IFN-gamma-deficient mice paradoxically show that IFN-gamma confers protection from EAU. Because of the implications of these findings for therapeutic use of IFN-gamma, we sought to reexamine these results in the rat, another species that shares essential immunopathologic features with human uveitis and is the commonly used animal model of uveitis. We generated transgenic rats (TR) with targeted expression of IFN-gamma in the eye and examined whether constitutive ocular expression of IFN-gamma would influence the course of EAU. We show here that the onset of rat EAU is markedly accelerated and is severely exacerbated by IFN-gamma. In both wild-type and TR rats, we found that the disease onset is preceded by induction of ICAM-1 gene expression and is characterized by selective recruitment of T cells expressing a restricted TCR repertoire in the retina. In addition, these events occur 2 days earlier in TR rats. Thus, in contrast to the protective effects of IFN-gamma in mouse EAU, our data clearly show that intraocular secretion of IFN-gamma does not confer protection against EAU in the rat and suggest that IFN-gamma may activate distinct immunomodulatory pathways in mice and rats during uveitis.",22,1999-Jan-01

During chronic inflammation, tertiary lymphoid tissue (TLT) can form within an inflamed organ, including the CNS. However, little is known about TLT formation in the neuroretina. In a novel spontaneous autoimmune mouse model of uveitis (R161H), we identified well-organized lymphoid aggregates in the retina and examined them for TLT characteristics. Presence of immune cells, tissue-specific markers, and gene expression patterns typically associated with germinal centers and T follicular helper cells were examined using immunohistochemistry and gene analysis of laser capture microdissected retina. Our data revealed the retinal lymphoid structures contained CD4(+) T cells and B cells in well-defined zonal areas that expressed classic germinal center markers, peanut lectin (agglutinin) and GL-7. Gene expression analysis showed upregulation of T follicular helper cell markers, most notably CXCR5 and its ligand CXCL13, and immunohistochemical analysis confirmed CXCR5 expression, typically associated with CD4(+) T follicular helper cells. Highly organized stromal cell networks, a hallmark of organized lymphoid tissue, were also present. Positive staining for phospho-Zap70 in retina-specific T cells indicated CD4(+) T cells were being activated within these lymphoid structures. CD138(+)/B220(+) plasma cells were detected, suggesting the retinal lymphoid aggregates give rise to functional germinal centers, which produce Abs. Interestingly, eyes with lymphoid aggregates exhibited lower inflammatory scores by fundus examination and a slower initial rate of loss of visual function by electroretinography, compared with eyes without these structures. Our findings suggest that the lymphoid aggregates in the retina of R161H mice represent organized TLT, which impact the course of chronic uveitis.",22,2016-Feb-01

Fuchs uveitis syndrome is a chronic, typically unilateral, ocular condition characterized by an asymptomatic mild inflammatory syndrome that can result in cataract and secondary glaucoma. Diagnosis is largely clinical because the etiology remains obscure. Fuchs uveitis syndrome is most likely the result of different insults or pathogenic mechanisms, including infections, autoimmune diseases, hereditary and sympathetic dysfunction. According to the infectious theory, the infection of herpes simplex virus, ocular toxoplasmosis, cytomegalovirus, rubella virus, and other viruses have been implicated in the pathogenesis of the disease. There is no indication for corticosteroid therapy in Fuchs patients, and treatment should be mostly reserved to cataract and glaucoma. Phacoemulsification with intraocular lens implantation is a safe procedure with good visual outcomes in patients with Fuchs uveitis syndrome. Glaucoma is often unresponsive to treatment and should actively be monitored both preoperatively and postoperatively in these patients. We discuss the current understanding of Fuchs uveitis syndrome from its clinical presentations through recommended management and provide a comprehensive description and the updated knowledge of its pathophysiology.",22,2020-1-1

To report the first case of a serpiginous choroiditis presenting after SARS-CoV-2 infection in a previously healthy young woman.
CASE DESCRIPTION: A 41-year-old woman reported blurry vision OS 1 month after a mild SARS-CoV-2 infection. Left eye fundus examination revealed multiple peripapillary atrophic lesions, adjacent to a larger diffuse, ill-defined, yellow-whitish deep amoeboid-like patch, involving the peripapillary region and extending temporally to the fovea. Multimodal imaging including fluorescein angiography, indocyanine-green angiography, fundus autofluorescence and optical coherence tomography was consistent with serpiginous choroiditis. A complete systemic work-up was performed to exclude potential infectious or inflammatory etiologies. The active choroidal lesions responded to high dose corticosteroids, with functional improvement. Immunomodulatory therapy with methotrexate was initiated for long-term management.
CONCLUSION: Serpiginous choroiditis is a rare but important sight-threatening condition that has been previously associated to viral infections, which seem to have a role in the induction and/or perpetuation of choroidal inflammation. SARS-CoV-2 infection appears to have played a role as a possible trigger for intraocular inflammation in this case. Therefore, COVID-19 patients reporting visual symptoms should be carefully evaluated in order to obtain adequate ophthalmological management to avoid irreversible visual damage.",22,2022-Jan-1

The complete nucleotide sequences of three human echovirus (EV) 11 strains and one EV19 strain, all of which caused outbreaks of enterovirus uveitis (EU), a new infant disease first identified in 1980 in Siberia, were determined. One EV11 strain which caused an outbreak of sepsis-like disease in Hungary was also sequenced. All four EV11 strains were mosaic recombinants of the prototype EV11 strain Gregory, with their non-structural coding regions and 5' NTRs being more similar to other prototype enteroviruses (EV1, EV9). However, this finding is probably a feature of all circulating enterovirus strains and may not be related to their altered virulence. A full genome sequence comparison of the three subtypes of EU-causing strains excludes the role of recent recombination in their emergence, and points to their independent emergence.",22,2004-Feb-1

Tobacco smoking has detrimental influence on human health.
AIM: The analysis of influence of tobacco smoking on retina diseases, uveitis, optic neuropathies, and thyroidassociated orbitopathy in adults and children.
METHODS: A comprehensive review of the literature performed through MEDLINE and PubMed searches, covering the years 2000-2016.
RESULTS: In adults, tobacco smoking is a strong risk factor for age-related macular degeneration, polypoidal choroidal vasculopathy, uveitis and inflamed cystoid macular edema as well as Grave`s ophthalmopathy. Tobacco smoking reduces thickness of the retina and choroid, plays a role in episcleritis, sclerits, tobacco optic neuropathy, and Leber's hereditary optic neuropathy. In children, maternal smoking is a significant risk factor for stages 3 and 4 retinopathy of prematurity, optic nerve hypoplasia among babies with a birth weight over 2500 g and thinner retinal nerve fiber layer.
CONCLUSION: Tobacco smoking plays an important role in the pathogenesis of many posterior eye segment diseases leading to blindness in adults and children.",22,2017-1-1

Systemic diseases are frequently associated with uveitis but are often not recognised by clinicians. An estimate of the prevalence in a large-scale uveitis population is essential for understanding the epidemiological profile and may be helpful for clinical practice.
DESIGN: A nationwide survey.
METHODS: Data were obtained from a national database which included the registration of uveitis cases from 23 provinces, 5 autonomous regions and 4 municipalities across mainland China. The primary outcome was identification of a systemic disease associated with uveitis.
RESULTS: From April 2008 through August 2018, 15 373 uveitis patients were included in the study. Males accounted for 52.9%, and the mean (SD) age of uveitis onset was 35.4 (15.9) years. After standardisation for age, the prevalence of systemic disease among patients with uveitis was 30.8% (95% CI, 30.1% to 31.6%). Vogt-Koyanagi-Harada disease (VKH; age-standardised prevalence, 12.7%; 95% CI, 12.1% to 13.2%), Behçet's disease (BD; 8.7%; 95% CI, 8.3% to 9.2%), ankylosing spondylitis (AS; 5.0%; 95% CI, 4.6% to 5.3%) and juvenile idiopathic arthritis (JIA; 1.2%; 95% CI, 1.0% to 1.3%) were the most common entities among 36 different forms of systemic diseases identified. The prevalence was significantly higher in males (37.0%; 95% CI, 36.0% to 38.1%) than in females (23.6%; 95% CI, 22.6% to 24.6%), and also higher in bilateral uveitis patients (41.2%; 95% CI, 40.2% to 42.2%) compared with unilateral cases (14.3%; 95% CI, 13.4% to 15.2%), and was highest in panuveitis (59.5%; 95% CI, 58.2% to 60.8%).
CONCLUSION: Approximately one third of uveitis patients in this nationwide survey have an associated systemic disease, whereby VKH, BD, AS and JIA are the most frequent entities seen in China.",21,2021-Jan-1

Green tea extract (GTE) ingested by rats exerted anti-oxidative activities in various ocular tissues as shown in our previous studies. The present work investigated anti-inflammatory effects of GTE on endotoxin-induced uveitis (EIU). EIU was generated in adult rats by a footpad injection of 1 mg/kg lipopolysaccharide (LPS). Oral administration of GTE (550 mg/kg) was given one, two or four times after LPS injection. Twenty-four hours later, LPS produced severe hyperemia and edema in the iris. Immunocytochemical examinations showed an accumulation of infiltrating cells in the aqueous humor that were immunopositive for cluster of differentiation 43 (CD43) and CD68, markers for leucocytes and macrophages, respectively. Analyses of the aqueous humor showed an increase in pro-inflammatory mediators including tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-α), interleukin-6 (IL-6) and monocyte chemoattractant protein-1 (MCP-1). GTE treatments improved the clinical manifestations and reduced infiltrating cells and protein exudation in the aqueous humor, which were not observed under half dose of GTE (275 mg/kg). The number of CD68 positive macrophages residing in the iris and ciliary was also reduced. GTE suppressed production of TNF-α, IL-6 and MCP-1 in the aqueous humor, which was associated with a down-regulation of LPS receptor complex subunits, Toll-like receptor 4 (TLR-4) and CD14, and suppression of nuclear factor-kappa Bp65 (NF-κBp65) in the iris and ciliary body. Our findings show that GTE is a potent anti-inflammatory agent against the inflammation of EIU, and suggest a potential use in treatment of acute uveitis.",21,2014-1-1

To evaluate the impact of macular edema on visual acuity and visual field sensitivity in uveitis.
DESIGN: This study utilized baseline data from the Multicenter Uveitis Steroid Treatment (MUST) Trial, a randomized, parallel treatment clinical trial comparing alternative treatments for intermediate, posterior and panuveitis.
PATIENTS & METHODS: 255 patients (481 eyes with uveitis) recruited at 23 subspecialty centers. Visual acuity, optical coherence tomography and Humphrey 24-2 visual field testing.
RESULTS: Macular edema was associated with impaired visual acuity (p < 0.01). Different phenotypes of macular edema were associated with different degrees of visual impairment: cystoid changes without retinal thickening were associated with moderately impaired visual acuity (-5 ETDRS letters), but visual acuity was worse in eyes with retinal thickening (-13 letters) and with both cysts and thickening (-19 letters). Uveitis sufficient to satisfy the study's inclusion criteria was associated with impaired visual field sensitivity, but eyes with macular edema had even worse visual field sensitivity (p < 0.01).
CONCLUSIONS: The observation that macular edema substantially reduces visual function suggests macular edema itself is an important endpoint to study in the treatment of uveitis. As uveitis and macular edema both impair visual field sensitivity as measured by Humphrey 24-2 perimetry, both should be considered when evaluating patients with uveitis and raised intraocular pressure for glaucoma.",21,2012-Jun-1

To investigate the role of CD4(+)CD25(+) Treg cells in the development of experimental autoimmune uveoretinitis (EAU).
METHODS: EAU was induced in B10RIII mice by immunization with IRBP(161-180) in complete Freund's adjuvant and evaluated clinically and pathologically on days 0, 7, 14, 21, and 28. Lymphocytes from draining lymph nodes (LNs) were subjected to flow cytometry to analyze the frequency of CD4(+)CD25(+) Treg cells. CD4(+)CD25(+) Treg cells and CD4(+)CD25(-) T cells were separated by means of magnetic-assisted cell sorting and cocultured or crossover cultured for 3 days. Proliferation of CD4(+)CD25(-) T cells was measured using a modified MTT assay. The levels of IFN-gamma and IL-17 in the supernatants were determined by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay.
RESULTS: Clinical and histopathologic results showed a severe intraocular inflammation in the immunized mice. The frequency of CD4(+)Foxp3(+) T cells and CD4(+)CD25(+)Foxp3(+) T cells in the draining LN lymphocytes was increased on day 7, reached its peak on day 14, and maintained a high level up to day 42. CD4(+)CD25(+) Treg cells obtained from mice on days 14 and 28 after immunization showed a stronger inhibitory effect on the proliferation of CD4(+)CD25(-) T cells and the production of IFN-gamma by CD4(+)CD25(-) T cells compared with those obtained from control mice. CD4(+)CD25(+) Treg cells did not affect IL-17 production. Transfer of CD4(+)CD25(+) Treg cells obtained from EAU mice was able to suppress EAU induction by IRBP(161-180) that was not observed after transfer of cells from mice that had received CFA alone, suggesting antigen specificity of the Treg response.
CONCLUSIONS: A significantly increased frequency and immunoregulatory action of CD4(+)CD25(+) Treg cells is associated with the development and regression of EAU, suggesting that CD4(+)CD25(+) Treg cells are induced during EAU and may be involved in its regression.",21,2010-Jan-1

To evaluate the 2-year outcomes of uveitic macular edema.
DESIGN: Longitudinal follow-up of a randomized cohort.
PARTICIPANTS: At baseline, 148 eyes of 117 patients enrolled in the Multicenter Uveitis Steroid Treatment (MUST) Trial had macular edema, and 134 eyes of 108 patients completed 2-year follow-up.
METHODS: Patients enrolled in the study were randomized to either systemic immunosuppression or intravitreal fluocinolone acetonide implant therapy. Macular edema was defined as thickening of the retina (center point thickness≥240 μm) on time-domain optical coherence tomography (OCT) of macula.
MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Improvement in macular edema (≥20% reduction in central point thickness on OCT), resolution of macular edema (normalization of thickness on OCT), and best-corrected visual acuity (BCVA).
RESULTS: Between randomization and 2-years' follow-up, 62% and 25% of eyes in the systemic and implant groups, respectively, received at least 1 supplemental regional corticosteroid injection. By 2-years' follow-up, macular edema improved in 71% of eyes and resolved in 60%. There were no differences between treatment groups in the proportion of eyes with macular edema improving (systemic therapy vs. implant, 65% vs. 77%; P=0.20) and resolving (52% vs. 68%; P=0.28), but eyes randomized to implant had more improvement in macular thickness (median decrease of 180 vs. 109 μm in the systemic therapy group; P=0.04). Eyes with baseline fluorescein angiographic leakage were more likely to improve than those without (76% vs. 58%; P=0.03). Overall, there was a mean 5-letter (1 line) improvement in BCVA at 2 years. Mean changes in BCVA from baseline at 2 years by macular edema response status were: resolution, +10 letters; improvement without resolution, +10 letters (P=0.92); little to no change, 6 letters (P=0.19); and worsening, -16 letters (worsening acuity; P=0.0003).
CONCLUSIONS: About two thirds of eyes with uveitic macular edema were observed to experience improvement in the edema and visual acuity with implant or systemic treatment. Fluocinolone acetonide implant therapy was associated with a greater quantitative improvement in thickness. Fluorescein angiography leakage was associated with a greater likelihood of improvement in macular edema.",21,2015-Nov-1

Conventional immunosuppressive drugs, anti-TNF alpha treatments and biotherapies are increasingly being used in non-infectious uveitis.
AREAS COVERED: The present work was led by a multidisciplinary panel of experts, including internal medicine specialists, rheumatologists and ophthalmologists, and proposes an extensive review on the use of biological agents in non-infectious uveitis.
EXPERT OPINION: In case of dependency to steroids or sight-threatening disease, conventional immunosuppressive drugs (methotrexate, azathioprine and mycophenolate mofetil) and/or biological therapies such as anti-TNF alpha treatments (adalimumab, infliximab) can be used to achieve and maintain disease quiescence. Interferon is an efficient immunomodulatory drug that can be proposed as second-line therapy in specific indications (eg. refractory macular edema, sight-threatening Behçet's uveitis). Other biologics, especially tocilizumab, are showing promising results. Local treatments (steroids, sirolimus etc.) can be used as adjuvant therapies in case of unilateral relapse. Therapeutic response must always be evaluated by clinical examination and appropriate ancillary investigations.",21,2019-May-1

The authors reviewed the outcome of extracapsular cataract extraction (ECCE) in 44 eyes of 38 patients with uveitis. Thirty-two of the 44 eyes received a posterior chamber lens implant; 87% of these achieved a stable visual acuity of 20/40 or better. Sixty-seven percent (8 of the 12 eyes) not receiving an implant achieved this level. The authors' results and current literature suggest that absolute control, preoperatively and postoperatively, of all uveitis inflammation and careful selection of patients as lens implant candidates are crucial for successful cataract surgery in uveitis patients. Complete removal of lens cortex and placement of an all-PMMA posterior chamber lens within the capsular bag are also believed to be important.",21,1989-Mar-1

To evaluate the use of biological response modifiers (BRM) in the treatment of refractory childhood uveitis.
DESIGN: Retrospective non-comparative case series of pediatric patients with uveitis treated with BRM.
PARTICIPANTS: 23 pediatric patients.
METHODS: All children (18 years or younger) who received a BRM were assessed for visual changes, time to control inflammation, and any associated adverse side effects. Thirteen patients were treated with infliximab, five with adalimumab, and five with daclizumab. All patients had bilateral eye involvement. Diagnoses of the participants included juvenile idiopathic arthritis, keratouveitis, sarcoid panuveitis, Adamantiades-Behcets disease, and idiopathic panuveitis.
MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Inflammation and visual acuity.
RESULTS: In the infliximab group 16 of 26 eyes (62%), and 10 of 13 patients (77%) demonstrated an improvement in visual acuity. Twenty of 26 eyes (77%) demonstrated an improvement in the degree of inflammation. In the adalimumab group, four of 10 eyes (40%) demonstrated an improvement in visual acuity, with five of 10 eyes (50%) demonstrating an improvement in inflammation. Four of 10 eyes (40%) in the daclizumab group demonstrated an improvement in vision with eight of 10 eyes (80%) demonstrating an improvement in inflammation.
CONCLUSION: BRM appear to be safe to use in children, and represent a useful therapeutic adjunctive drug group for treating recalcitrant childhood uveitis.",21,2007-Oct-1

METHOD: Descriptive case series.
RESULTS: A total of 12 cases of varied presentations of tubercular uveitis diagnosed over a period of 1 year of which six cases are described in detail. Presentations included choroidal tuberculomas, multifocal choroiditis, recurrent granulomatous uveitis, panuveitis with cystoid macular oedema, and serpiginous choroiditis. All cases had a chronic or recurrent course and responded very well to antitubercular treatment. Diagnosis was mainly assisted by positive tuberculin testing.
CONCLUSION: A high index of suspicion helps diagnose ocular tuberculosis in areas of low prevalence of the disease. It forms part of the differential diagnosis of any chronic or recurrent uveitis, especially in an at-risk patient. Antitubercular treatment seems highly effective.",21,2006-Sep-1

Laser flare photometry (LFP) is a new quantitative method for the evaluation of aqueous flare, making flare the only inflammatory parameter that can be evaluated precisely and objectively. The aim of this study was to characterize the inflammatory pattern of acute human leukocyte antigen-B27 (HLA-B27)-related anterior uveitis and to determine further clinical use and limitations of LFP in posterior inflammation.
METHODS: In the first part of the study, 78 episodes of HLA-B27-related acute anterior uveitis were analyzed to determine mean pretreatment (initial) flare, mean flare evolution, need for additional periocular steroids, and mean duration of an episode. In the second part of the study, the use of LFP was further tested in posterior inflammation, first by analyzing the predictive value of a subclinical LFP-detected flare increase for disease recrudescence in posterior scleritis, and then by exploring clinical applications for LFP in posterior uveitis, where LFP was essential either in the establishment of a diagnosis or in guiding therapeutic decisions.
RESULTS: Mean initial flare in HLA-B27-related acute anterior uveitis was 160 +/- 22 photons/msec, and mean duration of an episode was 18.5 +/- 15 days. A 50% and 90% flare reduction occurred after 2 and 8 days, respectively. In posterior scleritis, LFP was accurate in monitoring response to systemic steroid therapy and a small flare increase was predictive for disease recrudescence in five of six cases (predictive value 0.83, sensitivity 100%). In posterior uveitis, LFP was sensitive to monitor systemic treatments and to establish a diagnosis in unclear cases by measuring the effect of a selective therapy (therapeutic trial) on the flare level.
CONCLUSION: In acute anterior HLA-B27-associated uveitis, LFP represented a potential improvement in management by allowing precise adjustment of therapy. In uveitis of the posterior segment, our data confirm the validity of LFP to monitor response and adjust systemic therapy and to detect disease recurrence in patients with a sufficient pretreatment level of associated blood-aqueous barrier disruption (flare).",21,1997-Jan-1

Blau syndrome is a hereditary granulomatous disease caused by mutations in the CARD15 gene that is diagnosed in children of young age with exanthema/erythema, arthritis/periarthritis and/or uveitis. We report two cases of Blau syndrome in Danish Caucasian monozygotic male twins, exhibiting a heterozygous de novo R334W mutation in codon 334 of CARD15. The patients were initially diagnosed as having sarcoidosis. In both twins, symptoms (exanthema, arthritis/periarthritis) started at 1 year of age, and were followed by uveitis at 7-10 years of age. There was no involvement of the lungs or other organs. An initial course of standard antituberculous treatment had no effect on the symptoms. Hydroxychloroquine and cyclosporine A were also ineffective, and the latter caused impaired renal function. Partial symptomatic relief was obtained with prednisolone and increased benefit was observed in combination with methotrexate. Subsequent introduction of the TNF-alpha inhibitor eternacept did not discernibly benefit the clinical condition, but was associated with recurrent infections. In contrast, a trial of infliximab therapy demonstrated clinical efficacy and eliminated all symptoms, restoring a high quality of life. At follow up at 20 years of age (after 2-5 years of infliximab treatment) the twins had an almost normal physical appearance and a normal psychomotoric development, indicating a favourable short-term prognosis of the disease. Blau syndrome has pathologic, clinical and therapeutic features in common with sarcoidosis, but rarely involves the lungs or other parenchymatous organs. In children, discrimination between early onset sarcoidosis and Blau syndrome should include a CARD15 mutation analysis.",21,2006-Dec-1

Prostaglandin E (PGE) concentration the aqueous humor of an intact rabbit eye was less than 0.1 ng. per milliliter and increased to 19 +/- 3 ng. per milliliter 60 minutes following paracentesis. The rise in PGE level was associated with clinical signs of ocular inflammation. Pretreatment with triamcinolone reduced both the accumulation of PGE in the aqueous humor and the inflammatory response following paracentesis. intravitreal injection of E. coli endotoxin into rabbit eyes increases PGE level in the anterior chamber to 72 +/- 17 ng. per milliliter and induced acute uveitis. slices of iris and ciliary body (ICB) derived from either rabbit eyes with endotoxin-induced uveitis or normal eyes were incubated for 60 to 240 minutes and the rate of PGE release into the medium was measured by radioimmunoassay. after a 4 hour incubation, the PGE release from inflamed ICB was threefold higher than that of normal ICB. incubation of inflamed ICB with hydrocortisone, or Millicorten (100 mug per milliliter) for 4 hours reduced PGE accumulation in the medium by 50 and 81 per cent, respectively. Aldosterone had no effect on the rate of PGE release from inflamed ICB throughout the incubation period. Hydrocortisone or Millicorten also reduced PGE tissue content of inflamed ICB by about 74 per cent during the period of incubation. Indomethacin (100 mug per milliliter) abolished PGE accumulation. The suppressive action of hydrocortisone on PGE release into the incubation medium was prevented by the addition of arachidonic acid (2 mug per milliliter), a substrate for prostaglandin synthesis. By contrast , the inhibitory action of indomethacin was not affected by provision of arachidonic acid. We suggest that glucocorticosteroids reduce PGE accumulation by limiting the availability of the substrate for prostaglandin biosynthesis and thus suppress the inflammatory response.",21,1977-Jan-1

Clinical data suggest a role for VEGF in uveitic cystoid macular oedema (CME), even though the data on intravitreal VEGF levels in these eyes is still inconclusive. We determined intravitreal VEGF levels and treated uveitis patients with intravitreal bevacizumab.
METHODS: Intravitreal VEGF levels were measured in eight uveitis patients and 10 controls using cytometric bead array technology. In 11 eyes of a second group of uveitis patients, CME was treated using 1.25 mg bevacizumab intravitreally. Re-injections of bevacizumab were given in patients showing a transient positive effect, defined as an increase of the best-corrected vision of at least two lines on a snellen chart. Alternatively, triamcinolone was given in patients, not responding to bevacizumab.
RESULTS: Mean intravitreal VEGF concentration was 82.75+/-171.71 pg/ml (+/-SD) (range, 0.0-502.1 pg/ml), and below the detection levels in controls. A significant reduction of retinal thickness was seen at weeks 2 (P=0.001) and 4 (P=0.007). A significant improvement in VA was seen at week 2 (P=0.02). Patients presenting with a CME in baseline fluorescein-angiogram responded well towards bevacizumab treatment, unless an extensive leakage from the choroid or a leakage of the optic disk was detectable. In these patients, only intravitreally administered triamcinolone led to a reduction of the CME.
CONCLUSIONS: Our data suggest that patients presenting with a diffuse leakage from the choroid in the fluorescein angiogram or an extensive leakage of the optic disk should be treated with intravitreal triamcinolone, whereas in patients presenting only a cystoid macular oedema bevacizumab treatment seems like a good choice.",21,2009-Sep-1

Uveitis maybe induced by the use of various medications known as drug-induced uveitis (DIU), though rare it is an important cause of uveitis which one needs to be aware of. The drugs may be administered through any route including systemic, topical, and intravitreal. Ocular inflammation can be in the form of anterior, intermediate, posterior or pan uveitis, and rarely may present as episcleritis and scleritis. Identification of drug as the offending agent of uveitis is important as many a times stopping the drug may help recover the uveitis or the concomitant use of corticosteroids. An extensive literature review was done using the Pubmed. An overview of DIU is provided as it is important for us to be aware of this clinical entity.",21,2020-Sep-1

The process of inflammation is accompanied by an alteration of leukocyte-endothelial dynamics. Reciprocal changes in the endothelium and the white cell permit the leukocyte to relinquish its normal free-flowing state in order to roll, arrest, and emigrate through the endothelium. Although intravital microscopy is an established method to observe this process, the eye has been under-utilized for this purpose. Iris vasculature can be videophotographed without the artifact of trauma. We used rhodamine 6G in vivo staining of leukocytes from BALB/c mice in a model of inflammation induced by intravitreally injected endotoxin. Digital video technology was used to record observations at baseline, 2 h, and 4 h after the endotoxin injection. Off-line analysis of microhemodynamic parameters established that the percentage of venules exhibiting rolling increased significantly from 4% at baseline to 34% at 2 h and 82% at 4 h after endotoxin injection. We found a marked increase in leukocyte arrest within 4 h (601+/-119 cells per mm(2) vs. 2+/-1 cells per mm(2) in control animals). Although shear stress differs minimally between iris arterioles and venules, both rolling and arrest occurred preferentially in venules indicating that shear stress is not the dominant factor for determining cell adhesion. Compared to previous reports on intravital microscopy, our methodology includes refinements or advantages in visualizing cells that have transmigrated as well as the avoidance of surgical trauma. The resolution and quantifiable nature of this technique are such that the methodology can be applied to repetitive observation of leukocyte-endothelial dynamics during an immune response.",21,2000-Jun-23

Adalimumab was recently approved for the treatment of noninfectious intermediate uveitis, posterior uveitis, and panuveitis.
OBJECTIVE: To assess the effect of adalimumab on the visual functioning and quality of life in patients with corticosteroid-dependent noninfectious intermediate uveitis, posterior uveitis, and panuveitis.
DESIGN: A post hoc analysis of clinical trials of adults with active (VISUAL-1) and inactive (VISUAL-2) noninfectious intermediate uveitis, posterior uveitis, and panuveitis was conducted in the United States, Canada, Europe, Israel, Australia, Latin America, and Japan. A total of 217 patients (110 adalimumab, 107 placebo) in VISUAL-1 and 226 patients (115 adalimumab, 111 placebo) in VISUAL-2 were studied using intent-to-treat analyses. The clinical trials were conducted between August 10, 2010, and May 14, 2015.
INTERVENTIONS: In VISUAL-1 and VISUAL-2, patients were randomized to receive adalimumab, 80-mg, subcutaneous loading dose followed by 40 mg every other week or placebo for 80 weeks. All patients underwent prednisone tapering, with patients in VISUAL-1 receiving an initial prednisone burst.
MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: The 25-item National Eye Institute Vision Function Questionnaire (NEI VFQ-25) composite score questionnaire assessed the impact of visual impairment from the patient's perspective; scores on the questionnaire range from 0 to 100, with higher scores indicating better vision-related quality of life. The change in NEI VFQ-25 from best state achieved prior to week 6 (VISUAL-1) and from baseline state (VISUAL-2) to the final or early termination visit was determined in each group and statistically compared using analysis of variance. The temporal effects of adalimumab and placebo on NEI VFQ-25 were investigated using a longitudinal model.
RESULTS: Of the 217 patients in VISUAL-1, 124 (57.1%) were women; the mean (SD) age was 42.7 (14.9) years. Of the 226 patients in VISUAL-2, 138 (61.1%) were women; the mean (SD) age was 42.5 (13.4). In VISUAL-1, the change from final score to best score in NEI VFQ-25 was -1.30 for adalimumab and -5.50 for placebo-a difference of 4.20 (95% CI, 1.04 to 7.36; P = .01) associated with adalimumab compared with placebo. In VISUAL-2, the change from baseline NEI VFQ-25 was 3.36 for adalimumab and 1.24 for placebo-a difference of 2.12 (95% CI, -0.81 to 5.04; P = .16). In both trials, the longitudinal models showed a significant difference in NEI VFQ-25 between adalimumab and placebo of 3.07 (95% CI, 2.09 to 4.06; P < .001) and 4.66 (95% CI, 0.05 to 9.26; P = .048) in the VISUAL-1 (74.15 vs 71.08) and VISUAL-2 (82.39 vs 77.73) trials, respectively.
CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: This post hoc analysis suggests that adalimumab is associated with statistically significant and clinically meaningful improvements in patient-reported visual functioning for patients with noninfectious intermediate uveitis, posterior uveitis, and panuveitis.

To describe the clinical features in patients presenting with ocular toxoplasmosis after the fifth decade and to analyze laboratory findings in comparison to uveitis history and clinical data.
DESIGN: Prospective consecutive observational case series.
METHODS: A prospective clinical analysis of 27 consecutive patients older than 50 years of age with primary or recurrent ocular toxoplasmosis was performed during a period of 8 years. These cases account for 12% of all ocular toxoplasmosis cases irrespective of age indexed in our institution during the same period. Paired serum and aqueous humor samples were tested for anti-Toxoplasma gondii IgG, IgM, and IgA antibodies. The presence of T. gondii DNA in aqueous humor was determined by polymerase chain reaction followed by DNA hydridization method.
RESULTS: Although similar in age, two groups were distinguished clinically: 12 patients (44%) presented with usual forms of retinochoroiditis (mean +/- SD, 1.6 +/- 0.5 disk areas [DA] in size); 15 patients (56%) presented with atypical lesions, greater than 3 DA in size (mean +/- SD, 5.0 +/- 2.0 DA). The second group showed a higher rate of complications (P =.028) and a poorer visual outcome (P =.015). Twenty-four patients (89%) had intraocular IgG production, 17 (63%) had intraocular IgA production, 3 (11%) had intraocular IgM production, and 12 (44%) had a positive T. gondii DNA detection.
CONCLUSIONS: After the fifth decade, ocular toxoplasmosis remains an important cause of posterior uveitis. The combination of antibody detection by immunocapture tests with T. gondii DNA detection, both in aqueous humor, allowed the diagnosis of toxoplasmic infection in the atypical cases with large ocular lesions.",21,2002-Apr-1

Pediatric uveitis accounts for 5-10% of all uveitis. Uveitis in children differs from adult uveitis in that it is commonly asymptomatic and can become chronic and cause damage to ocular structures. The diagnosis might be delayed for multiple reasons, including the preverbal age and difficulties in examining young children. Pediatric uveitis may be infectious or noninfectious in etiology. The etiology of noninfectious uveitis is presumed to be autoimmune or autoinflammatory. The most common causes of uveitis in this age group are idiopathic and juvenile idiopathic arthritis-associated uveitis. The stepladder approach for the treatment of pediatric uveitis is based on expert opinion and algorithms proposed by multidisciplinary panels. Uveitis morbidities in pediatric patients include cataract, glaucoma, and amblyopia. Pediatric patients with uveitis should be frequently examined until remission is achieved. Once in remission, the interval between follow-up visits can be extended; however, it is recommended that even after remission the child should be seen every 8-12 weeks depending on the history of uveitis and the medications used. Close follow up is also necessary as uveitis can flare up during immunomodulatory therapy. It is crucial to measure the impact of uveitis, its treatment, and its complications on the child and the child's family. Visual acuity can be considered as an acceptable criterion for assessing visual function. Additionally, the number of cells in the anterior chamber can be a measure of disease activity. We review different aspects of pediatric uveitis. We discuss the mechanisms of noninfectious uveitis, including autoimmune and autoinflammatory etiologies, and the risks of developing uveitis in children with systemic rheumatologic diseases. We address the risk factors for developing morbidities, the Standardization of Uveitis Nomenclature (SUN) criteria for timing and anatomical classifications, and describe a stepladder approach in the treatment of pediatric uveitis based on expert opinion and algorithms proposed by multi-disciplinary panels. In this review article, We describe the most common entities for each type of anatomical classification and complications of uveitis for the pediatric population. Additionally, we address monitoring of children with uveitis and evaluation of Quality of Life.",21,2022-1-1

The pattern of uveitis seen in a caucasian population in Iowa was found to be very similar to that seen in London in spite of geographical and climatic differences in the two locations. Acute anterior uveitis was the commonest type of uveitis but fewer of the Iowa patients showed radiological evidence of ankylosing spondylitis or Reiter's syndrome. Toxoplasmosis was responsible for 9% of cases in both series. It is concluded that genetic factors are more important than geographic location in determining the types of uveitis which occur in a caucasian population.",21,1984-1-1

To evaluate the occurrence and characteristics of uveitis related to tubulointerstitial nephritis (TIN) in children.
DESIGN: Prospective, observational, multicenter, partly placebo-controlled treatment trial.
PARTICIPANTS: Nineteen children with a biopsy-proven TIN.
METHODS: Patients were treated with prednisone or followed without treatment. In addition to the nephrologic evaluations, the prospective follow-up included structured ophthalmological examinations at the onset of TIN and at 3 and 6 months after the diagnosis.
MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Occurrence, clinical features, and outcome of uveitis.
RESULTS: Some 84% (16/19) of the patients had uveitis, 83% (5/6) in the nontreatment group and 82% (9/11) in the prednisone-treated group. The remaining 2 patients, originally in the nontreatment group, were switched to the prednisone group after 2 weeks. Both of them developed uveitis. Altogether, 3 patients developed uveitis during prednisone treatment and 2 patients showed worsening of uveitis despite the systemic corticosteroid. Some 50% (8/16) of the patients with uveitis presented with no ocular symptoms; 88% (14/16) of the patients had a chronic course of uveitis. Two patients were diagnosed with uveitis before nephritis; nephritis and uveitis were diagnosed within 1 week from each other in 7 patients, and uveitis developed 1 to 6 months after the diagnosis of TIN in 7 patients.
CONCLUSIONS: There was no statistically significant difference in the occurrence of uveitis in patients with TIN in the prednisone and nontreatment groups. In this study, the occurrence of uveitis associated with TIN was considerably higher than previously reported. Uveitis related to TIN may develop late and is often asymptomatic. The ophthalmological follow-up of all patients with TIN is warranted for at least 12 months starting with 3-month intervals.

Suppressors of cytokine signaling (SOCS) are implicated in immunopathogenic mechanisms of autoimmune diseases. We show here that SOCS expression in retina is temporarily correlated with progression of experimental autoimmune uveitis (EAU), an organ-specific autoimmune disease that serves as model of human uveitis. Peak of EAU correlates with highest SOCS genes expression while disease resolution coincides with their down-regulation. Surprisingly, SOCS5 is constitutively expressed in retina. SOCS5 expression increases significantly during EAU and remains elevated even after disease resolution. Our data suggest that cytokine-inducible SOCS members may be involved in negative regulation of inflammatory cytokines activities during EAU, while constitutively expressed SOCS5 may have neuroprotective functions.",21,2005-Nov-1

To validate a scale for grading vitreous haze in uveitis using digitized photographs and standardized scoring.
DESIGN: Evaluation of clinical research methodology.
METHODS: Calibrated Bangerter diffusion filters inducing incremental decrements of spatial contrast were placed in front of the camera lens while photographing a normal eye to simulate vitreous haze. The photographs were digitized and an ordinal scale was created from 0 (none) to 8 (highest level of opacification at which fundus details could be seen). The scale steps correspond approximately to decimal Snellen visual acuities of 1.0, 0.8, 0.4, 0.2, 0.1, 0.04, 0.02, 0.01, and 0.002, with approximately 0.3 log step between each step. For validation, digitized fundus photographs of uveitis patients were displayed on a computer monitor for comparison with the standard photos. Three observers graded the test set twice under standard conditions. Interobserver and intraobserver variability and κ values for agreement greater than chance were calculated.
RESULTS: Variance component analysis determined that 87.7% of the variance in grades was attributable to the test item rather than to grader or session. The intraclass correlation between graders and grading sessions varied from 0.84 to 0.91. Simple agreement within 1 grade between graders and sessions occurred in 90 ± 5.5% of gradings. κ values averaged 0.91, which is considered near perfect.
CONCLUSIONS: A 9-step photographic scale was designed to standardize the grading of vitreous haze in uveitis patients using fundus photographs. The scale is potentially adaptable to clinical trials in uveitis.",21,2010-Nov-1

To demonstrate the manifestations and complications of uveitis, and their medical and surgical management, in a very large group of patients attending the Manchester Uveitis Clinic (MUC), a specialist uveitis clinic in the Northwest of England, UK.
METHODS: Retrospective retrieval of data on a computerized database incorporating all new referrals to MUC from 1991 to 2013.
RESULTS: A total of 3000 new patients with uveitis were seen during a 22-year period, of which 25.2% had a single acute episode, 13.6% had acute recurrent uveitis, 20.2% had chronic fluctuating uveitis, and 41.0% had chronic unremitting uveitis. The commonest complications were cataract (35% of patients), macular edema (20.5%), and glaucoma (19.5%). Oral steroids were required in 36% of patients, oral immunosuppression in 16%, and biologic treatment in 2%. Major intraocular surgery was required in 28%.
CONCLUSIONS: Oral steroid usage is not an independent risk factor for cataract formation in patients with uveitis. Oral immunosuppression usage has increased 4-fold during this study period.",21,2015-Apr-1

Psoriasis, psoriatic arthritis, and uveitis are inflammatory disorders with significant overlap in their inflammatory pathways. Limited evidence is available about the relationship between psoriatic disease and uveitis.
OBJECTIVE: To investigate the potential bidirectional relationship between psoriatic disease, including psoriasis and psoriatic arthritis, and uveitis.
DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: We performed a nationwide cohort study of the Danish population from January 1, 1997, through December 31, 2011. We included 74,129 Danish patients with psoriasis who were 18 years or older during the study period. Patients were identified through administrative registries, and information on age, sex, socioeconomic status, medication, and comorbidity was obtained using individual-level linkage of administrative registers. We performed data analysis from January 27 through March 4, 2015.
EXPOSURES: Diagnosis of mild or severe psoriasis or psoriatic arthritis for uveitis risk and diagnosis of uveitis for the risk for psoriasis or psoriatic arthritis.
MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: Diagnosis of uveitis, mild psoriasis, severe psoriasis, or psoriatic arthritis. We calculated incidence rates (IRs) and estimated IR ratios adjusted for potential confounders using Poisson regression.
RESULTS: We identified 74,129 cases of psoriasis and psoriatic arthritis and 13,114 cases of uveitis. The IRs (95% CIs) for uveitis were 2.02 (1.99-2.06), 2.88 (2.33-3.56), 4.23 (2.40-7.45), and 5.49 (3.36-8.96) for the reference population and those with mild psoriasis, severe psoriasis, and psoriatic arthritis, respectively. In the reference population, these IRs (95% CIs) were 9.37 (9.30-9.45), 1.12 (1.10-1.15), and 1.04 (1.01-1.06), and in patients with uveitis, these statistics were 15.51 (12.92-18.62), 2.66 (1.72-4.13), and 4.25 (3.00-6.01) for mild psoriasis, severe psoriasis, and psoriatic arthritis, respectively. Adjusted IR ratios (95% CIs) for uveitis were 1.38 (1.11-1.70 [P = .02]), 1.40 (0.70-2.81 [P = .34]), and 2.50 (1.53-4.08 [P < .001]) for patients with mild psoriasis, severe psoriasis, and psoriatic arthritis, respectively. For patients with uveitis, IR ratios (95% CIs) were 1.59 (1.32-1.91 [P < .001]) for mild psoriasis, 2.17 (1.40-3.38 [P < .001]) for severe psoriasis, and 3.77 (2.66-5.34 [P < .001]) for psoriatic arthritis, respectively.
CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: We found a bidirectional association between psoriatic disease and uveitis. Increased focus on eye symptoms in patients with psoriasis and psoriatic arthritis and on skin and joint symptoms in patients with prior or current uveitis may be appropriate.",21,2015-Nov-1

Sera of patients diagnosed as having the active Vogt-Koyanagi-Harada (VKH) syndrome, Behcet's syndrome or sympathetic ophthalmia as well as normal controls were evaluated by ELISA and by staining of normal human retinal tissue using the avidin-biotin-peroxidase complex (ABC) technique for anti-retinal antibodies. No anti-retinal S-antigen antibodies were detected by ELISA. However, autoimmune antibodies were found against the outer segments of photoreceptors and Müller cells in patients with the VKH syndrome, with lower titers in some patients with Behcet's syndrome, and in a few patients with sympathetic ophthalmia. These results suggested anti-retinal antibodies were present and that retinal autoimmunity may play a role in pathogenesis in varieties of posterior uveitis. In addition, the indirect immunoperoxidase staining technique may facilitate the diagnosis of VKH in uncertain cases.",21,1985-Aug-1

To compare high-definition (HD) spectral-domain optical coherence tomography [SD-OCT] (Cirrus HD-OCT; Carl Zeiss, Dublin, California, USA) with time-domain optical coherence tomography [TD-OCT] (Stratus version 4; Carl Zeiss) for imaging macula in patients of uveitis.
DESIGN: Interventional case series.
METHODS: Thirty consecutive patients (51 eyes) with uveitis of various causes with vitreous haze of 1+ or worse were treated in an institutional setting. All patients had their vitreous haze graded and OCT scans both on TD-OCT (Stratus) and SD-OCT (Cirrus). Information obtained from Cirrus OCT scans was compared with that obtained from Stratus OCT scans.
RESULTS: Overall, for all grades of media clarity, the macula was interpreted as normal in 30 eyes (58.8%) on Stratus OCT and 26 eyes (50.9%) on Cirrus OCT and abnormal in 15 eyes (29.4%) on Stratus OCT and 24 eyes (47.0%) on Cirrus OCT, whereas poor scan quality deterred any interpretation in six eyes (10.0%) on Stratus OCT and only in one eye (1.8%) on Cirrus OCT. Additional information on Cirrus OCT could be obtained in nine (21.9%) of 41 eyes with grade 1+ vitreous haze, six (75%) of eight eyes with grade 2+ vitreous haze, and one eye (50%) with vitreous haze of 3+.
CONCLUSIONS: Our preliminary results suggest that SD Cirrus HD-OCT has an advantage over TD Stratus OCT in uveitic eyes by providing better identification of normal and pathologic structure in patients with poor media clarity.",21,2008-Jun-1

The Effects of Youngsters' Eyesight on Quality of Life (EYE-Q) is a novel measure of vision-related quality of life (QOL) and function in children. We aim to determine the validity of the EYE-Q in childhood uveitis.
METHODS: We abstracted medical record data on arthritis and uveitis in a convenience sample of children with juvenile idiopathic arthritis (JIA) and/or uveitis. In addition to the EYE-Q, parents and patients completed questionnaires on overall QOL (Pediatric Quality of Life Inventory [PedsQL]), and physical functioning (Childhood Health Assessment Questionnaire [C-HAQ]).
RESULTS: Among 57 children (8 JIA, 24 JIA and uveitis, 25 uveitis alone), 102 ocular examinations were performed within 1 month of completing questionnaires. Uveitis patients had bilateral disease (69%), anterior involvement (78%), synechiae (51%), and cataracts (49%). Children with vision loss in their better eye (visual acuity [VA] 20/50 or worse) had worse EYE-Q (P = 0.006) and PedsQL (P = 0.028) scores, but not C-HAQ scores. The EYE-Q moderately correlated with logMAR VA (rs  = -0.43), PedsQL (rs  = 0.43), and C-HAQ (rs  = -0.45), but was not correlated with anterior chamber cells or intraocular pressure. The PedsQL and C-HAQ did not correlate with VA or cells. There were strong correlations between the parent and child EYE-Q (rs  = 0.62). Cronbach's α for the child report was 0.91. The EYE-Q had strong test-retest reliability (rs  = 0.75).
CONCLUSION: The EYE-Q may be an important tool in the assessment of visual outcomes in childhood uveitis and an improvement over general measures in detecting changes in vision-related function.",21,2015-Nov-1

Authors: Lin, Phoebe
Publication Date: 2019-Apr-1
PMID: 30834680
The purpose of this article is to review the literature on relationships between the intestinal microbiota and ocular inflammatory disease, specifically non-infectious uveitis and age-related macular degeneration. The importance of the intestinal microbiota in uveitis pathogenesis has been shown by multiple groups demonstrating that alterations in the microbiota induced by certain oral antibiotics results in reduced uveitis severity, and another group demonstrating that a commensal intestinal bacterial antigen activates retina-specific autoreactive T cells, potentially indicating a commensal trigger for uveitis. Additionally, commensal intestinal bacterial metabolite short chain fatty acids can be utilized to suppress autoimmune uveitis. Age-related macular degeneration is associated with intestinal dysbiosis, which is partially influenced by genetic risk alleles and AREDS supplementation. Strategies for therapeutically targeting the intestinal microbiota might involve several approaches, including the use of antibiotics, dietary changes, drugs that supplement beneficial bacterial metabolites or target causative bacterial strains, dietary strategies or faecal microbial transplantation. In summary, the intestinal microbiota are at the cross-roads of genetic and environmental factors that can promote ocular conditions such as non-infectious uveitis and age-related macular degeneration, partially via its dynamic influence on mucosal and systemic immunity. The intestinal microbiome thus represents a salient potential target for therapeutic modulation to treat these potentially blinding conditions.",21,2019-Apr-1

Behcet's disease is a clinical entity with mouth and genital ulcers, skin lesions, and both anterior and posterior uveitis as its major criteria. It has been theorized that Behcet's disease is immune complex mediated, and is characterized by multiple attacks which often lead to severe visual handicap. Behcet's disease patients with severe ocular involvement and cytotoxic and/or systemic corticosteroid agent failures were treated with cyclosporin (CsA). CsA therapy effectively abrogated the acute phase of the ocular attack and either totally prevented, or markedly reduced, the recurrences of these attacks. Generally, patients tolerated the medication well; occasionally however, renal toxicity secondary to cyclosporin therapy prevented prescription of a maximally effective therapeutic dose of the drug. CsA levels in plasma were dose-dependent for each patient, but the dosage per kg of CsA needed to obtain a specific plasma level varied greatly from patient to patient. Circulating immune complex levels were not universally elevated during the acute ocular attack. However, increases in circulating immune complex concentrations were noted after treatment with CsA was begun and the disease became clinically inactive. These data, as well as the effectiveness of CsA, an agent with predominantly anti-T cell effects, raise a question as to whether circulating immune complexes are centrally relevant to the pathogenesis of this disorder, and if T cell mediation of this disease must be contemplated.",21,1985-Jun-1

The production of large amounts of nitric oxide (NO) by inducible nitric oxide synthase (iNOS) has been described as a double-edged sword eliciting pro- or anti-inflammatory effects in different immune situations. Our aim, therefore, was to investigate its role in experimental autoimmune uveoretinitis (EAU), a model of ocular inflammation, induced in the Lewis rat following a single footpad injection of retinal Ags. iNOS enzyme was not detected in the normal Lewis rat eye, but was strongly expressed by infiltrating ED1+ macrophages during the acute inflammatory stages of EAU. Treating immunized animals with L-arginine increased urinary NO metabolite (NOx) levels, accelerated the inflammatory response, and increased disease severity, whereas treatment with the NOS inhibitor, N(G)-nitro-L-arginine methyl ester, reduced NOx excretion, delayed the onset, and reduced the clinical signs of EAU. Reverse transcription-PCR analysis of ocular tissue from untreated and treated animals detected iNOS mRNA at all stages of disease, and expression was up-regulated during peak disease. L-arginine treatment enhanced cytokine mRNA expression, particularly of IFN-gamma, which was detected earlier than in control animals, corresponding with the more rapid onset of disease and increased disease severity observed in this group. N(G)-nitro-L-arginine methyl ester had little or no effect on iNOS or inflammatory cytokine mRNA expression. These results suggest NO is central to the pathogenesis of EAU and highlight the importance of the macrophage as an effector cell in what is considered a CD4+ T cell-dependent disease. Furthermore, this study demonstrates the therapeutic potential of NOS inhibitors in the treatment of inflammatory and autoimmune mediated disease.",21,1997-Nov-15

To study the differences in aqueous cytokines in Posner-Schlossman Syndrome (PSS) patients with and without human cytomegalovirus (CMV) DNA in the aqueous humor.
METHODS: This is a prospective study. Fifty-three uveitis patients with clinical signs of PSS were enrolled and aqueous humor samples were collected. Fourteen PSS patients were positive of CMV DNA in the aqueous by polymerase chain reaction (PCR) analysis. These eyes were negative of common ocular pathogens such as herpes simplex virus, varicella-zoster virus, rubella virus and toxoplasma. Twenty-five otherwise healthy cataract patients were enrolled as controls. Cytokine concentration was measured by a magnetic color-bead-based multiplex assay and analyzed using statistical and classification approaches.
RESULTS: The average age of 53 PSS patients was 48.74±13.43 years (yrs) (mean ± standard deviation) and 66.3±15.0 yrs for the controls. The median CMV viral DNA copy number was 26000/mL aqueous (range 1400 to 85000 copies/mL) in 14 CMV positive patients as determined by quantitative PCR. PSS aqueous had significantly higher Interleukin (IL)-8 (CXCL8), monocyte chemotactic protein-1 (CCL2), macrophage inhibitory protein 1-β (CCL4), granulocyte colony-stimulating factor (GCSF) and transforming growth factor-β (TGF-β) levels than controls after adjusted by age and gender. IL-2, IL-12, tumor necrosis factor-α (TNF-α) and interferon-α (IFN-α) levels were significantly lower in PSS aqueous than controls. No difference between CMV positive PSS and CMV negative PSS aqueous was observed. Over 97% of PSS samples were distinguished from controls by elevated CXCL10 (>500 ng/mL), CXCL8 (>30 ng/mL) and CCL2 (>60 ng/mL) levels.
CONCLUSION: PSS eyes were characterized by elevated aqueous chemokine concentration. The presence of CMV viral DNA was not associated with significant change of the type of cytokine expression in PSS patients.",21,2012-1-1

Vogt-Koyanagi-Harada syndrome (VKH) is a bilateral, diffuse granulomatous uveitis associated with neurological, audiovestibular, and dermatological systems. The primary pathogenesis is T-cell-mediated autoimmune response directed towards melanocyte or melanocyte-associated antigens causing inflammation of the choroidal layer. This phenomenon usually leads to diffuse inflammatory conditions throughout most parts of eye before ocular complications ensue. The diagnosis is achieved mainly by clinical features according to the revised diagnostic criteria of VKH published in 2001, without confirmatory serologic tests as a requirement. However, ancillary tests, especially multimodal imaging, can reliably provide supportive evidence for the diagnosis of early cases, atypical presentations, and evaluation of management. Prompt treatment with systemic corticosteroids and early non-steroidal immunosuppressive drug therapy can lessen visually threatening ocular complications and bring about good visual recovery. Close monitoring warrants visual stabilization from disease recurrence and ocular complications. This article review aims not only to update comprehensive knowledge regarding VKH but also to emphasize three major perspectives of VKH: immunogenetics as the major pathogenesis of the disease, multimodal imaging, and therapeutic options. The role of anti-vascular endothelial growth factor therapy and drug-induced VKH is also provided.",21,2016-Aug-1

Leptospiral organisms have long been presumed to be associated with the presence of equine recurrent uveitis. This project was undertaken to determine the presence of Leptospira spp. in the aqueous humor of horses with uveitis to determine if there was an association with inflammation. Thirty horses were determined to have recurrent uveitis based on clinical evaluation or history. Sixteen horses were judged clinically and historically to be free of uveitis and were used as controls. Aqueous humor samples were cultured and evaluated by PCR for the presence of Leptospira DNA. Serum was collected and evaluated for the presence of antibodies against five serovars in a leptospirosis panel. Twenty-one of 30 horses with recurrent uveitis and one of 16 uveitis-free horses were positive by PCR for the presence of Leptospira DNA. Six of these 21 horses with uveitis were culture positive for leptospires from the aqueous humor. Serologic results did not correlate well with the presence of Leptospira DNA or organisms in the aqueous humor. Leptospira spp. are present in a high percentage of horses with naturally occurring recurrent uveitis.",20,2000-Jul-1

PMID: 19657978
Uveitis is defined as an intraocular inflammation induced by different etiologies. Though the precise pathogenesis is still unknown, accumulating evidence shows that both innate and adaptive immune responses may be predominant mechanisms involved in the development of uveitis. Toll-like receptors have been shown to be expressed in the human eye and play an important role in infectious uveitis. The NOD proteins, expressed mainly in the cytosol by APCs, recognize the products of bacteria and participate in the development of uveitis. HLA genes have been associated with some uveitis entities, including acute anterior uveitis (HLA-B27), Behcet disease (HLA-B51), birdshot retinochoroidopathy (HLA-A29), Vogt-Koyanagi-Harada syndrome (HLA-DR4), sarcoidosis, sympathetic ophthalmia, juvenile idiopathic arthritis, tubulointerstitial nephritis and uveitis (TINU) syndrome, and pars planitis (HLA-DR15). The exact mechanism whereby certain HLA genes predispose to a certain uveitis entity has not yet been elucidated. In addition, several studies have demonstrate that polymorphisms in certain immune response genes, such as tumor necrosis factor (TNF), MHC class I polypeptide-related sequence A (MICA), interleukin-1 (IL-1), and some chemokines, may contribute to the development of human uveitis. Polymorphisms in the gene coding for the costimulatory molecule known as cytotoxic T-lymphocyte antigen 4 (CTLA-4) were recently found in Chinese patients with VKH syndrome but not in patients with Behcet disease. Further developments in the unraveling of immune response genes may lead to a better understanding of human uveitis and will hopefully allow the development of novel treatment regimes.",20,2009-1-1

To analyze the risk factors associated with emerging intraocular inflammation (IOI) after intravitreal brolucizumab injection (IVBr) to treat age-related macular degeneration (AMD).
METHODS: This study included 93 eyes of 90 patients. The incidence of emerging IOI was analyzed. The patients were classified into IOI or non-IOI groups, and background clinical characteristics in each group were compared.
RESULTS: IOI occurred in 14 eyes of 14 cases (16%; five women, nine men [5:9]; IOI group) after IVBr; contrastingly, no IOI occurred in 76 patients (10 women, 66 men [10:66]; non-IOI group). The mean ages in IOI and non-IOI groups were 79.4 ± 8.1 and 73.8 ± 8.9 years old, respectively, and the average age in the IOI group was significantly higher than that in the non-IOI group (P = 0.0425). In addition, the percentages of females in the IOI and non-IOI groups were 43% and 13%, respectively, and IOI occurred predominantly in females (odds ratio: 4.95, P = 0.0076). Moreover, the prevalence of diabetes in the IOI and non-IOI groups was 64% and 32%, respectively, with a significant difference (odds ratio: 3.90, P = 0.0196). In contrast, the prevalence of hypertension in the IOI and non-IOI groups was 36% and 57%, respectively, with no significant difference (P = 0.15).
CONCLUSION: The comparison of clinical profiles of IOI or non-IOI cases in IVBr treatment for AMD suggests that the risk factors for IOI are old age, female sex, and history of diabetes; however, IOI with vasculitis or vascular occlusion in this cohort does not seem to cause severe visual impairment. Further studies are required to investigate potential risk factors for IOI.",20,2021-1-1

The development, progression, and recurrence of autoimmune diseases are frequently driven by a group of participatory autoantigens. We identified and characterized novel autoantigens by analyzing the autoantibody binding pattern from horses affected by spontaneous equine recurrent uveitis to the retinal proteome. Cellular retinaldehyde-binding protein (cRALBP) had not been described previously as autoantigen, but subsequent characterization in equine recurrent uveitis horses revealed B and T cell autoreactivity to this protein and established a link to epitope spreading. We further immunized healthy rats and horses with cRALBP and observed uveitis in both species with typical tissue lesions at cRALBP expression sites. The autoantibody profiling outlined here could be used in various autoimmune diseases to detect autoantigens involved in the dynamic spreading cascade or serve as predictive markers.",20,2006-Aug-1

Uveitis can occur in all segments of the eye and has multiple etiologies, (many of which remain poorly understood). Appropriate diagnosis and subsequent management can depend on elucidation of the clinical signs. Many diagnostic features are often best identified with Fluorescein angiography. However these signs are often peripheral and visualization can be difficult with traditional angiography. Optos ultra wide field scanning laser ophthalmoscope (Optos Panoramic 200MA; Optos PLC, Dunfermline, Scotland, United Kingdom) performs ultra wide angle fluorescein angiography and its benefit in uveitis was reviewed.
DESIGN: The Jules Stein Eye Institute retina division imaging database was reviewed and five common cases were selected.
METHODS: The relative benefits of wide field angiography were evaluated in each of these cases.
RESULTS: Ultra wide field angiography was found to have advantages compared to traditional angiography. It allowed clear identification of peripheral signs and accurate documentation of disease progression.
CONCLUSION: In this division ultra wide field angiography has become the investigation of choice (over traditional angiography) in cases of intermediate and posterior uveitis.",20,2009-1-1

To evaluate the safety and efficacy of gevokizumab for the treatment of Behçet's disease uveitis in a prospective, open-label, randomized phase 2 trial.
METHODS: Behçet's disease patients with new acute ocular exacerbation or at risk of exacerbation received 30 or 60 mg gevokizumab every 4 weeks intravenously or subcutaneously, on top of a stable regimen of immunosuppressives and corticosteroids (≤20 mg/day equivalent prednisolone). Patients withdrew in cases of ocular exacerbation.
RESULTS: A total of 21 patients were included (17 acute and 4 at-risk; mean duration of uveitis 45.6 ± 37.4 months). There were no serious adverse events related to gevokizumab. Recorded adverse events were mostly associated with exacerbation of uveitis or its complications. Response was evaluated for 14 acute patients and all showed rapid control of acute ocular exacerbation, mostly within 1 week, without any increase in corticosteroid dosage.

To determine whether uveitis in cats was associated with intraocular production of feline herpesvirus type 1 (FHV-1)-specific antibodies or with detection of FHV-1 DNA in aqueous humor (AH).
ANIMALS: 44 cats with idiopathic uveitis, 29 cats with uveitis attributed to Toxoplasma gondii infection, 13 FHV-1 seropositive cats without uveitis, and 9 FHV-1 seronegative cats without uveitis.
PROCEDURE: ELISA were used to detect FHV-1-specific antibodies and total IgG antibodies in serum and AH, and the Goldmann-Witmer coefficient (C-value) for intraocular antibody production was calculated. A polymerase chain reaction assay was used to detect FHV-1 DNA in AH.
RESULTS: FHV-1 seroprevalence among cats with uveitis was not significantly different from seroprevalence among cats without uveitis. Intraocular FHV-1 antibodies were never detected in cats without uveitis. Significantly more cats with idiopathic uveitis (22/44) or with toxoplasmic uveitis (11/29) had evidence of intraocular antibody production (C-value > 1) than did cats without uveitis. Only cats with idiopathic uveitis had FHV-1 C-values > 8. Among cats with evidence of intraocular antibody production, cats with idiopathic uveitis had a significantly higher median FHV-1 C-value (9.61) than did cats with toxoplasmic uveitis (2.56). Overall, FHV-1 DNA was detected in AH from 12 cats, 11 of which had uveitis.
CONCLUSIONS AND CLINICAL RELEVANCE: Results suggest that FHV-1 can infect intraocular tissues of cats and that intraocular FHV-1 infection may be associated with uveal inflammation in some cats.",20,1999-Aug-1

Ocular toxoplasmosis and Fuchs' heterochromic cyclitis are well-defined diseases that have completely different clinical courses. We studied 13 patients (seven men and six women, ranging in age from 18 to 73 years) who had Fuchs' heterochromic cyclitis and the focal necrotizing chorioretinal lesions characteristic of ocular toxoplasmosis. The reason for this association is still unknown, as is the pathogenesis of Fuchs' heterochromic cyclitis. None of the patients had ciliary injection or posterior synechiae, but 11 of the 13 (84.6%) had keratic precipitates, anterior chamber reaction, and cataracts. Six patients (38.4%) had iris transillumination, two (15.3%) had glaucoma, and four (30.7%) had lesions in the fellow eyes.",20,1982-Jun-1

The term 'uveitis' covers a broad spectrum of ocular inflammation affecting the iris, ciliary body, and/or the choroid, all of which comprise the uveal tract. Severe cases of uveitis need be treated aggressively to prevent damage caused by chronic inflammation. Untreated or poorly managed cases can lead to ciliary body dysfunction, inadequate aqueous production, chorioretinal damage, and possibly blindness.
AREAS COVERED IN THIS REVIEW: There are many medications that can be used to treat uveitis. Corticosteroids are available in several formulations: topical drops, regional injections, oral and intravenous. Immunomodulatory agents that can be used for uveitis are antimetabolites, T-cell inhibitors, alkylating agents, and biologic response modifiers. These medications, their appropriate uses, and side effect monitoring will be detailed.
WHAT THE READER WILL GAIN: There is a stepladder approach to treatment of ocular inflammation. Corticosteroids are the treatment of choice for treating acute flares. Steroid free remission is the goal of therapy and can be achieved with the use of chemotherapeutic agents. Which medications are appropriate and how to escalate therapy will be reviewed.
TAKE HOME MESSAGE: Chronic systemic corticosteroid therapy is not an acceptable long treatment plan for uveitis, unless all other medications have failed. Steroid sparing immunosuppressive therapy should be pursued as soon as acute flares of uveitis have been controlled.",20,2010-May-1

Over the past decade, the off-label use of biologic agents such as TNF-α antagonists, including infliximab and adalimumab, has improved the treatment armamentarium for refractory immune-mediated uveitis, with particular success in Behçet disease-associated uveitis. Golimumab is a novel fully human anti-TNF-α monoclonal antibody that has been approved for the treatment of rheumatoid arthritis, psoriatic arthritis, and ankylosing spondylitis, with very promising results. Herein, the authors present the use of GLM in a case of Behçet uveitis refractory to other TNF-α blockers. There are only two reports in the literature about the use of GLM in uveitis, describing four patients with JIA-associated uveitis and a case of idiopathic retinal vasculitis. To the authors' knowledge, this is the first report about the use of GLM in Behçet uveitis.",20,2013-Apr-1

Pediatric uveitis differs from adult-onset uveitis and is a topic of special interest because of its diagnostic and therapeutic challenges. Children with uveitis are often asymptomatic and the uveitis is often chronic, persistent, recurrent, and resistant to conventional treatment. Anterior uveitis is the most common type of uveitis in children; the prevalence of intermediate, posterior, and panuveitis varies geographically and among ethnic groups. Regarding etiology, most cases of pediatric uveitis are idiopathic but can be due to systemic inflammatory disorders, infections, or a manifestation of masquerade syndrome. Ocular complications include cataracts, hypotony or glaucoma, band keratopathy, synechiae formation, macular edema, optic disc edema, choroidal neovascular membranes, and retinal detachment. These complications are often severe, leading to irreversible structural damage and significant visual disability due to delayed presentation and diagnosis, persistent chronic inflammation from suboptimal treatment, topical and systemic corticosteroid dependence, and delayed initiation of systemic disease‒modifying agents. Treatment for noninfectious uveitis is a stepwise approach starting with corticosteroids. Immunomodulatory therapy should be initiated in cases where quiescence cannot be achieved without steroid dependence. Patients should be monitored regularly for complications of uveitis along with systemic and ocular adverse effects from treatments. The goals are to achieve steroid-free durable remission, to reduce the risk of sight-threatening complications from the uncontrolled ocular inflammation, and to avoid the impact of lifelong burden of visual loss on the child and their family. Multidisciplinary management will ensure holistic care of affected children and improve the support for their families.",20,2018-1-1

Immune privilege (IP), a term introduced to explain the unpredicted acceptance of allogeneic grafts by the eye and the brain, is considered a unique property of these tissues. However, immune responses are modified by the tissue in which they occur, most of which possess IP to some degree. The eye therefore displays a spectrum of IP because it comprises several tissues. IP as originally conceived can only apply to the retina as it contains few tissue-resident bone-marrow derived myeloid cells and is immunologically shielded by a sophisticated barrier - an inner vascular and an outer epithelial barrier at the retinal pigment epithelium. The vascular barrier comprises the vascular endothelium and the glia limitans. Immune cells do not cross the blood-retinal barrier (BRB) despite two-way transport of interstitial fluid, governed by tissue oncotic pressure. The BRB, and the blood-brain barrier (BBB) mature in the neonatal period under signals from the expanding microbiome and by 18 months are fully established. However, the adult eye is susceptible to intraocular inflammation (uveitis; frequency ~200/100,000 population). Uveitis involving the retinal parenchyma (posterior uveitis, PU) breaches IP, while IP is essentially irrelevant in inflammation involving the ocular chambers, uveal tract and ocular coats (anterior/intermediate uveitis/sclerouveitis, AU). Infections cause ~50% cases of AU and PU but infection may also underlie the pathogenesis of immune-mediated ""non-infectious"" uveitis. Dysbiosis accompanies the commonest form, HLA-B27-associated AU, while latent infections underlie BRB breakdown in PU. This review considers the pathogenesis of uveitis in the context of IP, infection, environment, and the microbiome.",20,2020-1-1

Abatacept (ABA), a selective T cell costimulation modulator that binds to CD80 and CD86 on antigen-presenting cells, was investigated for its antiinflammatory effect in treating severe chronic uveitis associated with juvenile idiopathic arthritis (JIA).
METHODS: Our retrospective study was conducted by members of the Multinational Interdisciplinary Working Group for Uveitis in Childhood (MIWGUC). Patients with JIA who are receiving ABA treatment for active uveitis were included. In all patients, uveitis had been refractory to previous topical and systemic corticosteroids, immunosuppressives, and at least 1 tumor necrosis factor-α inhibitor. A standardized protocol was used to document uveitis (MIWGUC) and arthritis. Baseline visit and visits at 3, 6, 9, and 12 months before and after ABA start were evaluated. Primary outcome measure was defined as achievement of uveitis inactivity; secondary outcome measures were tapering of corticosteroid and/or immunosuppressive treatment, and occurrence of complications.
RESULTS: In all, 21 patients (16 female) with active uveitis (n = 21) and arthritis (n = 18) were included (mean age 11.8 ± 3.6 yrs). In 7 of 18 patients with active arthritis at baseline, inactivity was achieved following ABA treatment. Uveitis inactivity was achieved in 11 patients, but recurred later in 8 of them, and remained active in another 10 cases. Systemic corticosteroids or immunosuppression were tapered in 3 patients, but uveitis recurred in all of them during further followup. Ocular complications secondary to uveitis were present in 17 patients at baseline, while 3 patients developed new ocular complications during followup.
CONCLUSION: A sustained response to ABA was uncommon in patients with severe and refractory uveitis.",20,2015-Apr-1

Since January 1990, data from uveitis patients have been systematically stored in a computer data bank. During the period from January 1990 to March 1993, 435 new patients (185 female and 250 male, mean age 43 years; range 6-92) were seen at the Uveitis Clinic of the Hôpital Jules Gonin. These 435 patients (630 eyes) were subdivided into anterior uveitis (268 patients--62%), intermediate uveitis (47 patients--11%), posterior uveitis (89 patients--20%) and panuveitis (31 patients--7%). The incidence of uveitis for the referral area considered was calculated to be 17 per 100,000 inhabitants per year. A specific diagnosis was found in 312 cases (72%). The most frequently diagnosed entities were HLA-B27-associated acute anterior uveitis (67 cases--15.4%), uveitis associated with acute herpes zoster ophthalmicus (40 cases--9.2%), toxoplasmosis (39 cases--9%), typical pars planitis (29 cases--6.7%), sarcoidosis (29 cases--6.7%), Fuchs' heterochromic cyclitis (27 cases--6.2%), herpetic anterior uveitis (21 cases--4.8%) and acute retinal necrosis (11 cases--2.5%).

Metagenomic deep sequencing (MDS) demonstrates that persistent and active rubella virus (RV) infection is associated with Fuchs heterochromic iridocyclitis (FHI).
OBJECTIVE: To assess the utility of MDS in identifying RV infection in patients with uveitis.
DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: This case series assessed 6 patients diagnosed by MDS with RV-associated uveitis at a tertiary uveitis referral center in the United States.
EXPOSURES: Prior RV infection.
MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: Clinical examination findings, slitlamp photography, corneal confocal imaging, and infectious pathogen genome obtained from RNA sequencing.
RESULTS: Six white men (age range, 36-61 years) were diagnosed with RV-associated uveitis by MDS. Three patients exhibited iris heterochromia associated with their uveitis in classic FHI fashion. The other 3 patients had less classic FHI features and exhibited anterior vitritis. Three patients had in vivo corneal confocal microscopy, with 2 demonstrating stellate keratic precipitates in addition to endothelial infiltration, spotlike holes, and enlarged intercellular boundaries. Of these 3 patients, 1 patient exhibited polymorphism and polymegathism of the endothelial cells.
CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: These findings suggest that persistent RV infection is associated with recurrent or chronic anterior or anterior-intermediate uveitis as well as corneal endothelial cell damage. Ophthalmologists should consider RV infection as a potential cause of hypertensive anterior and intermediate uveitis.",20,2019-Apr-01

Intermediate uveitis (IU) is described as inflammation in the anterior vitreous, ciliary body and the peripheral retina. In the Standardization of Uveitis Nomenclature (SUN) working group's international workshop for reporting clinical data the consensus reached was that the term IU should be used for that subset of uveitis where the vitreous is the major site of the inflammation and if there is an associated infection (for example, Lyme disease) or systemic disease (for example, sarcoidosis). The diagnostic term pars planitis should be used only for that subset of IU where there is snow bank or snowball formation occurring in the absence of an associated infection or systemic disease (that is, ""idiopathic"").

To assess the association between BNT162b2 mRNA coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) vaccine and the risk of active noninfectious uveitis (NIU).
DESIGN: Retrospective, population-based study.
PARTICIPANTS: Two million six hundred two thousand five hundred fifty-seven people who received the first vaccine dose between December 20, 2020, and April 30, 2021, and 2 441 719 people who received the second vaccine dose between January 10, 2021, and April 30, 2021.
METHODS: Events of active NIU were included if they occurred within 21 days after either vaccine dose. Active NIU was defined as newly active or worsening ocular inflammation requiring initiation or increase in local or systemic corticosteroids. Observed cases were compared with the expected number, based on the experience of the population in 2019.
MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Age- and sex-adjusted standardized incidence ratios (SIRs) and attributable risks after BNT126b2 vaccination.
RESULTS: Overall, 100 and 88 events of active NIU were recorded within 21 days after the first and second vaccine doses, respectively. Using the experience of the population in 2019 as a reference, after the first dose, the estimated age- and sex-adjusted SIR was 1.41 (95% confidence interval [CI], 1.15-1.71) along with a 21-day attributable risk of 1.12 cases per 100 000 vaccinees. After the second dose, the SIR was 1.31 (95% CI, 1.05-1.62), with an estimated attributable risk of 0.86 cases per 100 000 vaccinees. Anterior uveitis was the most common site of inflammation, occurring in 90.96% of eyes, and idiopathic uveitis was the most common cause (56.38%).
CONCLUSIONS: This study suggests that the BNT162b2 mRNA COVID-19 vaccine may be associated with an increased risk of active NIU. However, considering the small effect size and study limitations, this study does not provide proof for a cause-and-effect relationship. The small estimated attributable risks suggest that the impact on public health is relatively minor.",20,2022-Oct-1

To review current evidence for the treatment of ocular toxoplasmosis (OT).
DESIGN: Narrative review and expert recommendations.
METHODS: Meta-analysis and selected original articles from the medical literature were reviewed critically. Expert recommendations were analyzed.
RESULTS: Numerous observational studies suggest a benefit of short-term antimicrobial therapy for toxoplasmic retinochoroiditis in immunocompetent patients, although its efficacy has not been proven in randomized clinical trials. A randomized clinical trial revealed that intermittent trimethoprim/sulfamethoxazole treatment could decrease the rate of recurrence in high-risk patients. Intravitreal injection of clindamycin and dexamethasone was an acceptable alternative to the classic treatment for OT in a randomized clinical trial.
CONCLUSIONS: Opinions about therapy differ and controversy remains about its type, efficacy, and length. Intravitreal therapy may be promising for OT. A recent description of the presence of parasitemia in patients with active and inactive ocular toxoplasmosis raises new questions that need to be explored.",20,2011-Oct-1

Mice with targeted deletion of STAT3 in CD4(+) T-cells do not develop experimental autoimmune uveitis (EAU) or experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis (EAE), in part, because they cannot generate pathogenic Th17 cells. In this study, we have used ORLL-NIH001, a small synthetic compound that inhibits transcriptional activity of STAT3, to ameliorate EAU, an animal model of human posterior uveitis. We show that by attenuating inflammatory properties of uveitogenic lymphocytes, ORLL-NIH001 inhibited the recruitment of inflammatory cells into the retina during EAU and prevented the massive destruction of the neuroretina caused by pro-inflammatory cytokines produced by the autoreactive lymphocytes. Decrease in disease severity observed in ORLL-NIH001-treated mice, correlated with the down-regulation of α4β1 and α4β7 integrin activation and marked reduction of CCR6 and CXCR3 expression, providing a mechanism by which ORLL-NIH001 mitigated EAU. Furthermore, we show that ORLL-NIH001 inhibited the expansion of human Th17 cells, underscoring its potential as a drug for the treatment of human uveitis. Two synthetic molecules that target the Th17 lineage transcription factors, RORγt and RORα, have recently been suggested as potential drugs for inhibiting Th17 development and treating CNS inflammatory diseases. However, inhibiting STAT3 pathways completely blocks Th17 development, as well as, prevents trafficking of inflammatory cells into CNS tissues, making STAT3 a more attractive therapeutic target. Thus, use of ORLL-NIH001 to target the STAT3 transcription factor, thereby antagonizing Th17 expansion and expression of proteins that mediate T cell chemotaxis, provides an attractive new therapeutic approach for treatment of posterior uveitis and other CNS autoimmune diseases mediated by Th17 cells.",20,2012-1-1

Hypopyon uveitis has inflammatory, infective, and neoplastic causes and a high association with systemic disease. Careful questioning of the patient and detailed examination of the eye for other signs is necessary to guide the differential diagnosis and relevant investigations. Because the underlying causes require very different types of investigation and, if missed, can have serious sequelae for the patient, a rational approach based on the understanding of the causes of hypopyon uveitis is imperative.

Interphotoreceptor retinoid-binding protein (IRBP), a glycoprotein specific for the retina and pineal gland, induces inflammatory changes in these two organs in immunized animals. We report here on the identification of an immunodominant determinant of bovine IRBP that is highly immunogenic and immunopathogenic in the Lewis rat. The peptide, which comprises the sequence 1169-1191 of bovine IRBP, was shown to be immunodominant by its capacity to stimulate lymphocytes sensitized against whole IRBP. A comparison was made between peptide 1169-1191 and another peptide, 1158-1180, which is nondominant but is immunogenic and immunopathogenic in the Lewis rat. Peptide 1169-1191 was found to be superior in its immunological capacities; the minimal dose of 1169-1191 needed to induce cellular immune response or disease in Lewis rats (0.02-0.1 nmol/rat) is congruent to 1,000 times smaller than that of 1158-1180. In addition, unlike the ocular disease induced by 1158-1180, the disease produced by 1169-1191 resembled that induced by whole IRBP in its kinetics and histopathological features. The immunological activity of 1169-1191 in the Lewis rat was localized to the 10 residues at the COOH terminus; no such activity was exhibited by the truncated peptide 1169-1188, which comprises the 20 residues at the NH2 terminus of the full peptide. The usefulness of this unique experimental system in analyzing the role of immunodominance in peptide immunogenicity and immunopathogenicity is underscored.",20,1989-Jun-01

Literature review for indocyanine green angiography and evaluate the role of indocyanine green angiogram (ICGA) in patients with posterior uveitis seen at a tertiary referral eye care centre. Detailed review of the literature on ICGA was performed. Retrospective review of medical records of patients with posterior uveitis and dual fundus and ICGA was done after institutional board approval. Eighteen patients (26 eyes) had serpiginous choroiditis out of which 12 patients had active choroiditis and six patients had healed choroiditis, six patients (12 eyes) had ampiginous choroiditis, six patients (12 eyes) had acute multifocal posterior placoid pigment epitheliopathy, eight patients (10 eyes) had multifocal choroiditis, four patients (eight eyes) had presumed ocular histoplasmosis syndrome, four patients (eight eyes) had presumed tuberculous choroiditis, two patients (four eyes) had multiple evanescent white dot syndrome and two patients (four eyes) had Vogt Koyanagi Harada (VKH) syndrome. The most characteristic feature noted on ICGA was the presence of different patterns of hypofluorescent dark spots, which were present at different stages of the angiogram. ICGA provides the clinician with a powerful adjunctive tool in choroidal inflammatory disorders. It is not meant to replace already proven modalities such as the fluorescein angiography, but it can provide additional information that is useful in establishing a more definitive diagnosis in inflammatory chorioretinal diseases associated with multiple spots. It still needs to be determined if ICGA can prove to be a follow up parameter to evaluate disease progression.",20,2013-Apr-1

The irreversible loss of visual acuity in macular edema is usually attributed to permanent loss of photoreceptor cells, although there is hardly any information on changes in photoreceptor function in macular edema. The purpose of this study was to assess photoreceptor function in various stages of macular edema and to relate the findings to visual acuity and angiographic changes.
METHODS: Directional sensitivity (optical Stiles-Crawford effect) and visual pigment density of foveal cones was measured with a custom-built scanning laser ophthalmoscope (SLO) in 19 eyes of 19 patients. Twelve eyes exhibited macular edema: five of inflammatory origin, and seven of diabetic origin. Seven eyes with an intraocular inflammatory disease without clinical or angiographic evidence of edema were also included (four of which had previous macular edema and one of which had shown development of macular edema at the 1-year follow-up). Results of SLO measurements were related to findings using fluorescein angiography and Snellen visual acuity, both assessed at the time of SLO measurement and 6 months thereafter.
RESULTS: Eyes with macular edema exhibited diminished directional sensitivity of photoreceptor cells in the fovea compared with eyes without (P = 0.02). Visual pigment density of eyes with macular edema was decreased and associated with both initial and follow-up visual function and with the angiographic macular edema grade at follow-up. Abnormal directional sensitivity and pigment density were already present in eyes with slight edematous changes and normal visual acuity.
CONCLUSIONS: Eyes with inflammatory or diabetic macular edema showed decreased directional sensitivity and visual pigment density in the macular area. These findings may support a role for SLO measurements in detecting retinal damage due to macular edema.",20,2000-Nov-1

Soluble antigen (S-Ag) is a member of the arrestin family of protein with which it shares a high level of homology. It is an immunologically privileged retinal antigen that can elicit experimental autoimmune uveitis (EAU) and is thought to be a target for ocular inflammatory diseases. This study was conducted to identify in humans, the immunogenic determinants of human S-Ag and to establish whether a specific response profile occurs in particular ocular inflammatory conditions.
METHODS: Peripheral blood lymphocyte responses were measured against a panel of 40 overlapping synthetic peptides of human S-Ag in patients with chronic uveitis and compared with control subjects. Patients with Behçet disease, sarcoidosis, Vogt-Koyanagi-Harada, and sympathetic ophthalmia were tested.
RESULTS: A limited number of immunodominant determinants were identified for Behçet disease and sarcoidosis. These were all located at sites of limited homology with other known arrestins. In addition, several individual patients had prominent proliferative responses to multiple determinants well above that of control subjects. This determinant spread was observed in all disease entities except sympathetic ophthalmia, which did not show any immunoreactivity to S-Ag. Significant response shifts were also noted over time in two patients.
CONCLUSIONS: The results indicate that there are specific immunodominant determinants to human S-Ag in patients with certain forms of uveitis. However, in individual patients, response is not limited to these determinants. In the chronic stage of disease, response is spread over many determinants.",20,2001-Dec-1

In addition to optic neuritis (ON), multiple sclerosis (MS) may also involve the eye with a typically bilateral intermediate uveitis. The aim of this pilot study was to evaluate the efficacy of type I interferons (IFN) for the treatment of MS associated uveitis.
METHODS: In this non-randomised, retrospective observational case series 13 patients (eight female, five male) with proved MS and associated uveitis from five uveitis centres who were treated with interferon beta1a were included. Visual acuity (VA), cell count in the aqueous humour and vitreous, as well as the presence of cystoid macula oedema (CMO) were observed.
RESULTS: All except one patient had a bilateral form of intermediate uveitis (total of 24 eyes). Seven patients had documented CMO before IFN treatment (n = 13 eyes). Median duration of treatment was 24.6 months (range 7.9-78.7). VA improved in 17 eyes (comparing VA before therapy and at last follow up); while 10 eyes (36%) improved >or=3 Snellen lines. Aqueous cell count improved by 1.2 (SD 1.1) grades in all eyes. Vitreous cell count improved by 1.7 (1.4) in all eyes. Only two patients still had minimal CMO on last follow up angiographically. CMO resolved after or during IFN treatment in nine eyes.
CONCLUSIONS: IFN has been shown to have beneficial effects in patients with MS and/or ON. As shown in the models of experimental allergic encephalomyelitis (EAE) and uveitis, the neurological and ophthalmological manifestations seem to share similar pathogenic mechanisms. Treatment of MS associated uveitis with IFN appears to have beneficial effects on VA, intraocular inflammation activity, and the presence of CMO.",20,2005-Oct-1

Little attention has been paid to clinical features of cytomegalovirus (CMV) infections in individuals without human immunodeficiency virus (HIV).
OBJECTIVE: To describe the clinical manifestations and comorbidities of patients without HIV infection who have CMV-associated posterior uveitis or panuveitis.
DESIGN AND SETTING: Retrospective observational case series in an academic research setting.
PARTICIPANTS: The medical records were reviewed of 18 patients (22 affected eyes) diagnosed as having posterior uveitis or panuveitis who had aqueous positive for CMV by polymerase chain reaction techniques.
MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Demographic data, clinical manifestations, and associated systemic diseases were recorded.
RESULTS: Ocular features included focal hemorrhagic retinitis (n = 13) and peripheral retinal necrosis (n = 7). Two eyes had no focal retinal lesions but manifested vasculitis and vitritis. All patients exhibited vitreous inflammation. Inflammatory reactions in anterior segments developed in 14 of 22 eyes (64%). Retinal vasculitis was observed in 16 of 22 eyes (73%) and included mostly arteries (in 13 of 16 eyes [81%]). Eleven of 18 patients were taking immunosuppressive medications (5 for hematologic malignant diseases, 4 for systemic autoimmune diseases, and 2 following organ transplants). One additional patient was diagnosed as having non-Hodgkin lymphoma 3 months after the onset of CMV-associated panuveitis, and another patient had primary immunodeficiency disorder. Of the remaining 5 patients, 2 had diabetes mellitus, and 3 had no associated systemic diseases and exhibited no evidence of immune deficiency.
CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: Cytomegalovirus-associated infections of posterior eye segments can develop in patients without HIV infection who have compromised immune function of variable severity but may occur also in individuals who have no evidence of immune insufficiency. Cytomegalovirus infections located in posterior eye segments in patients without HIV infection caused intraocular inflammatory reaction in all cases and demonstrated more variable clinical presentation than classic CMV retinitis observed in patients with HIV infection.",20,2013-May-1

The profound impact that vision loss has on human activities and quality of life necessitates understanding the etiology of potentially blinding diseases and their clinical management. The unique anatomic features of the eye and its sequestration from peripheral immune system also provides a framework for studying other diseases in immune privileged sites and validating basic immunological principles. Thus, early studies of intraocular inflammatory diseases (uveitis) were at the forefront of research on organ transplantation. These studies laid the groundwork for foundational discoveries on how immune system distinguishes self from non-self and established current concepts of acquired immune tolerance and autoimmunity. Our charge in this review is to examine how advances in molecular cell biology and immunology over the past 3 decades have contributed to the understanding of mechanisms that underlie immunopathogenesis of uveitis. Particular emphasis is on how advances in biotechnology have been leveraged in developing biologics and cell-based immunotherapies for uveitis and other neuroinflammatory diseases.",20,2021-1-1

Masquerade syndromes are classically defined as entities which emulate inflammatory conditions but which are in fact due to a neoplastic process. Careful history and examination in concert with appropriate ancillary investigations and histopathologic evaluation of tissue specimens are required in order to make the correct diagnosis. Many conditions may result in an appearance mimicking an inflammatory condition. The authors review neoplastic conditions which may be considered masquerades. The most common of these is primary intraocular lymphoma or primary central nervous system lymphoma, occurring predominately in older individuals. Diagnostic strategies, therapy, and prognosis are reviewed in detail. Other conditions that can be considered masquerade syndromes are reviewed as well, including lymphomatous and nonlymphomatous conditions, such as melanoma, retinoblastoma, juvenile xanthogranuloma, metastatic lesions, and paraneoplastic syndromes, among others.",20,2002-1-1

Ocular disease occurs in approximately a third of sarcoidosis patients. The rate of disease varies around the world, with Japanese sarcoidosis patients having ocular disease in more than 70% of cases. If untreated, ocular disease can lead to permanent visual impairment, including blindness. The most common manifestation is uveitis, with anterior involvement often being self-limiting, whereas posterior involvement can be chronic. The diagnosis of ocular sarcoidosis in patients with known sarcoidosis usually requires a specific examination by an ophthalmologist. For patients presenting with uveitis of unknown etiology, criteria have been proposed for diagnosing ocular sarcoidosis. The treatment of ocular disease ranges from topical therapy to systemic treatments such as methotrexate. Recent reports have demonstrated that monoclonal antibodies blocking tumor necrosis factor can be quite effective for chronic refractory ocular sarcoidosis.",20,2010-Aug-1

Spontaneous equine recurrent uveitis (ERU) is an incurable autoimmune disease affecting the eye. Although retinal-autoantigen specific T-helper 1 cells have been demonstrated to trigger disease progression and relapses, the molecular processes leading to retinal degeneration and consequent blindness remain unknown. To elucidate such processes, we studied changes in the total retinal proteome of ERU-diseased horses compared to healthy controls. Severe changes in the retinal proteome were found for several markers for blood-retinal barrier breakdown and whose emergence depended upon disease severity. Additionally, uveitic changes in the retina were accompanied by upregulation of aldose 1-epimerase, selenium-binding protein 1, alpha crystallin A chain, phosphatase 2A inhibitor (SET), and glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP), the latter indicating an involvement of retinal Mueller glial cells (RMG) in disease process. To confirm this, we screened for additional RMG-specific markers and could demonstrate that, in uveitic retinas, RMG concomitantly upregulate vimentin and GFAP and downregulate glutamine synthetase. These expression patterns suggest for an activated state of RMG, which further downregulate the expression of pigment epithelium-derived factor (PEDF) and begin expressing interferon-gamma, a pro-inflammatory cytokine typical for T-helper 1 cells. We thus propose that RMG may play a fatal role in uveitic disease progression by directly triggering inflammatory processes through the expression and secretion of interferon-gamma.",20,2007-Jun-1

To describe the clinical characteristics and course of 16 patients with uveitis associated with multiple sclerosis (MS).
METHODS: The records of 1254 patients with uveitis were reviewed. Sixteen of these patients had MS. The history, review of systems, ocular findings, and clinical test results of each of these 16 subjects were analyzed. The mean follow-up time was 38 months.
RESULTS: Most patients with MS-associated uveitis were white females between 20 and 50 years of age. The diagnosis of MS preceded the onset of uveitis in 56%, followed it in 25%, and was made concurrently in 19% of the cases. In 94%, the uveitis was bilateral. Pars planitis was the most frequent form of uveitis in our study population (81%); concomitant anterior chamber inflammation was common and was granulomatous in nature 56% of the time. Forty-one percent of the eyes with MS-associated uveitis had 20/30 or better initial visual acuity. Among these treated patients, significant loss of visual acuity was uncommon.
CONCLUSIONS: MS-associated uveitis should be suspected in white female patients with bilateral uveitis, especially if pars planitis is present. These patients often retain useful vision for many years if treated.",20,2004-Jun-1

The aim of this prospective randomized clinical study was to evaluate the prevalence of ocular involvement in patients with inflammatory bowel disease (IBD).
MATERIALS AND METHODS: We prospectively evaluated 116 patients who went to the gastroenterology clinic with endoscopically proven IBD between December 2001 and February 2005. All patients were examined for evidence of ocular manifestations of IBD. Twenty patients had Crohn's disease and 96 had ulcerative colitis. The examination consisted of slit-lamp examinations, tonometry, visual acuity, and indirect ophthalmoscopy.
RESULTS: The mean age of the 116 patients with IBD who were enrolled was 40.6 +/- 14.4 years (range 16 to 75). Twelve of 20 patients (60%) with Crohn's disease and 22 of 96 patients (22.92%) with ulcerative colitis had ocular involvement. The most common ocular findings were conjunctivitis (8.62%) and blepharitis (6.9%) followed by uveitis (5.17%), cataract (5.17%), and episcleritis (3.45%). Extraintestinal complications were seen in 12 (35.3%) of 34 patients with ocular involvement and in 16 (19.5%) of 82 patients without ocular involvement.
CONCLUSION: Because the ocular complaints of IBD patients are often nonspecific, it may be helpful to performed eye examinations as a routine component in the follow-up of these patients. It is well-known that early diagnosis and treatment of ocular involvement may prevent serious ocular complications that could be associated with significant visual morbidity. In addition, clinicians should be aware that some ocular diseases, such as uveitis and scleritis, might precede a diagnosis of ulcerative colitis or Crohn's disease.",20,2007-Sep-1

To describe the clinical outcome of refractory ocular Behçet disease with adalimumab therapy.
METHOD: Retrospective review of records.
RESULTS: Twenty-one eyes of 11 male patients with ocular Behçet disease received adalimumab therapy. Of the 21 eyes, 17 had improvement of visual acuity by more than 3 lines after the average follow-up of 10.8 months. Ten out of 11 patients showed complete resolution of inflammation by 4 weeks. The dosages of corticosteroids and immunosuppressive drugs were reduced in most of the patients and stopped altogether in 3 and 6 patients, respectively. One patient on infliximab showed improvement of inflammation after switching over to adalimumab. No serious side effects were observed in any of the patients.
CONCLUSION: Adalimumab appears to be effective in Behçet disease. It has been shown to improve visual acuity and also to have a corticosteroid and immunosuppressive sparing effect. It can induce and maintain sustained remission of the disease.",20,2010-Jun-1

Ocular symptoms of transthyretin (TTR)-related familial amyloidotic polyneuropathy (FAP) suggest that ciliary pigment epithelium (CPE) may synthesize TTR and its TTR may lead to amyloid formation in addition to TTR from vessels and retinal pigment epithelium (RPE). To clarify sites of TTR synthesis in ocular tissues, we performed in situ hybridization and reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) for qualitative detection of TTR mRNA. In addition, we quantified levels of TTR mRNA expression by means of real-time quantitative RT-PCR. Furthermore, although TTR is an anti-acute phase protein in serum level, no reports on changes in TTR expression in ocular tissues during acute inflammation exist. To investigate changes in TTR expression in ocular tissues during inflammation, we induced uveitis by endotoxin challenge in rabbits and used real-time quantitative RT-PCR to examine changes in TTR mRNA expression in ocular tissues. In situ hybridization and RT-PCR qualitatively demonstrated TTR mRNA not only in RPE but also in CPE. Real-time quantitative RT-PCR showed that the level of TTR mRNA expression in the CPE was about one-third of that in the RPE. TTR mRNA expression in ocular tissues decreased as the degree of inflammation increased. These results suggest that TTR synthesized in the CPE may lead to ocular manifestations, especially glaucoma, in FAP. TTR mRNA also acts as an anti-acute phase reactant in ocular tissues.",20,2005-Sep-1

To identify and quantify the prevalence of patients with uveitis receiving systemic immunosuppression in Scotland.
METHODS: Anonymised data were prospectively collected on all patients with uveitis requiring systemic immunosuppression. Seven health boards participated over a 4-month period between 1 August 2005 and 30 November 2005.
RESULTS: 373 patients were identified, of whom 205 (55%) were female. The mean age was 46.4 (range 7-97 years). Using the data from the seven participating health boards, an estimated Scottish prevalence of 9 per 100 000 was calculated. Prevalence varied between 2 and 59 per 100 000. In National Health Service Grampian, all patients with uveitis, whether sight-threatening or not, are followed up at a specialist clinic. Extrapolating this figure to Scotland gives a prevalence of 25 per 100 000.
DISCUSSION: The data from National Health Service Grampian suggest that there is a significant shortfall in the number of patients identified by survey. If the ""missing population"" exists, then where are they? Some might be receiving appropriate treatment at non-specialist clinics, although simple under-reporting may play a part. Greater concern is for those patients receiving inappropriate treatment for their uveitis, or for those within the community who are either oblivious to or in self denial of their condition.",20,2007-Jan-1

Inflammatory intraocular eye diseases, grouped under the term uveitis are blinding conditions, believed to be mediated by pathogenic autoimmune processes that overcome the protective mechanisms of the immune privilege status of the eye. An animal model for these diseases, named experimental autoimmune uveitis (EAU), is induced by initiation of immunity against ocular-specific antigens, or it develops spontaneously in mice with T-cells that transgenically express TCR specific to the target eye antigen(s). T-Cells specific to ocular antigens are generated in the thymus and their majority are eliminated by exposure to their target antigen expressed in this organ. T-cells that escape this negative selection acquire pathogenicity by their activation with the target antigen. In spontaneous EAU, the microbiota play crucial roles in the acquisition of pathogenicity by providing both antigenic stimulation, by molecules that mimic the target ocular antigen, and an additional stimulation that allows invasion of tissues that harbor the target antigen. The pathogenic process is physiologically inhibited by the peripheral tolerance, composed of antigen-specific T-regulatory (Treg) lymphocytes. Deleting the Tregs enhances the ocular inflammation, whereas adoptively transferring them suppresses the pathogenic response. Potential usage of Treg cells for suppression of autoimmune diseases in humans is under intensive investigation.",20,2018-1-1

The role of uveitis, an uncommon ocular disease, is often neglected in research and treatment of autoimmune conditions. The study described the spectrum of uveitis at a referral center in North Italy, and compared that to a previously published series of patients.
METHODS: We reviewed all patients with uveitis diagnosed from 2013 to 2015 at the Immunology Eye Unit, Arcispedale S. M. Nuova-IRCCS, Reggio Emilia, Italy. We examined patient characteristics, disease spectrum, and etiologies.
RESULTS: In total, 990 cases of uveitis were identified, who were mostly female (59%) with a median age at presentation of 44 years (interquartile range = 29-57). Anterior uveitis was most frequent (53.5%), followed by panuveitis (22.8%), posterior (16.2%), and intermediate uveitis (5.5%). Anterior herpetic uveitis (15.6%), Fuchs uveitis (9.7%), and HLA-B27 positive anterior uveitis (7.7%) were the most common specific diagnoses. Compared with the previous series, we observed an increased incidence of uveitis, and a different pattern of diagnoses. Rates of herpetic, HLA-B27 positive uveitis, and presumed ocular tuberculosis were higher, but Fuchs uveitis was less frequent.
CONCLUSIONS: The pattern of uveitis appears to be changing, very likely due to population-level increases in infectious diseases, to the availability of new diagnostic tests and to the interdisciplinary approach used in patient diagnosis.",20,2018-Feb-1

Uveitis is a complex intraocular inflammatory disease resulting from several aetiological entities that are linked to geographical, genetic and socioeconomic variables. The purpose of this study was to provide an overview of the distribution patterns of uveitis as seen in a nationwide referral centre at a community hospital in Reggio Emilia, northern Italy, and to compare our data with those reported in previously published international series. The records of 1064 patients of Italian origin with uveitis referred to the Immunology Ocular Unit of the Arcispedale S. Maria Nuova Hospital in Reggio Emilia from 2002 to 2008 were classified and analysed. Data regarding sex, race, residence, age at presentation and at onset of uveitis, ocular involvement, clinical characteristics, ocular condition, and systemic disease associations were collected. The mean age at onset of uveitis was 41 years (range: 1-94), and the male-to-female ratio was 1:1.2. Anterior uveitis was the most common location (51.2%), followed by posterior uveitis (23.4%), panuveitis (19.6%), and intermediate uveitis (5.8%). The most frequent entities included Fuchs uveitis (22.7%), herpetic anterior uveitis (9.9%), toxoplasmosis (6.9%), HLA-B27-associated anterior uveitis (5.3%), and Behçet's disease (5.3%). The distribution we observed of the most common disease entities conformed to previous international series. In our series, Fuchs uveitis represented the most common diagnosis (22.7%, 45% of anterior uveitis). The high percentage of specific diagnosis (74%) can be explained by the establishment of new disease categories over time as well as by a systematic multi-disciplinary diagnostic approach.",20,2010-Oct-1

Human autoimmune uveitides are diverse and complex. Animal models have been developed for studying the pathogenesis of uveitis because of the difficulties in obtaining tissues from a patient's inflamed eye for experiments. There are animal models for experimental uveitis that provoke inflammation of different tissues of the eye and represent different forms of uveitis. Since inflammatory cells can infiltrate any part of the uvea and spill over to nonuveal tissues, such as retina, various antigens have been used to induce uveitis. Most of those models that represent autoimmune forms of uveitis are induced with proteins specific for photoreceptor cells (S-antigen, IRBP, rhodopsin, recoverin, phosducin). Nonretinal antigens, including melanin-associated proteins and myelin basic protein, are also good inducers of uveitis in animals.",20,2002-1-1

The varying clinical appearance within a group of 103 patients with Fuchs' Heterochromic Uveitis (FHU) is discussed. Bilateral cases accounted for 7.8% of patients. Cataract was found in 80.2% of cases after 8.8 years mean follow-up, and glaucoma affected 26.2% of patients. The most important diagnostic criteria are the typical pattern of iris atrophy and depigmentation, the characteristic intraocular inflammation, and complicated cataract. These are described in detail. The correct diagnosis of FHU is important because it affects future management and prognosis. The presence or absence of macroscopic heterochromia is not a helpful component of the ocular examination and should play little part in diagnosis. FHU does not necessarily present in its classical form, and may first resemble acute anterior uveitis or pars planitis. The syndrome may be the end stage of a number of different conditions.",20,1991-1-1

Behçet's disease is characterized by three primary components: iridocyclitis (historically with hypopyon), aphthous lesions in the mouth, and ulceration of the genitalia. Erythema nodosum, arthropathy and thrombophlebitis often accompany these manifestations, but the ocular symptoms may be the most important and serious manifestations of the disease. Central nervous system involvement, most often due to necrotizing vasculitis, may be the most protean manifestation of the disease, leading to death. The frequency of ocular manifestations is 70-85% in patients with the disease; the underlying disease mechanism in all organ systems is an occlusive vasculitis. Although the most common ocular symptom is that of anterior uveitis, often with hypopyon as a very late sign, the presence of necrotizing retinal vascular lesions is well known and often obscured by the severity of the anterior reaction. Definitions, incidence, clinical characteristics, differential diagnosis, and management of Behçet's ocular disease are discussed, as are the interrelationships of the different organ manifestations. The ophthalmologist should be familiar with the full spectrum of disease presentation since he or she may be the first physician to encounter the Behçet's patient.",20,1982-1-1

Ginkgo biloba extract (GBE) contains many different flavone glycosides and terpenoides. Several previous studies have demonstrated that GBE exhibits a wide variety of biological activities, including an antioxidant action, on which we focused our attention. The aim of the present study was to investigate the efficacy of GBE on endotoxin induced uveitis in rats. The anti-inflammatory potency of GBE in vivo was compared with that of prednisolone. In addition, we also investigated nitric oxide (NO), prostaglandin E2 (PGE2), tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-alpha) and the expression of iNOS in a mouse macrophage cell line (RAW 264.7) treated with GBE in vitro to clarify the anti-inflammatory effect.
METHODS: EIU was induced in male Lewis rats by a footpad injection of lipopolysaccharide (LPS). Immediately after the LPS inoculation, either 1, 10 or 100 microg of GBE were injected intravenously. 24hr later, the aqueous humor was collected from both eyes, and the number of infiltrating cells, protein concentration and NO level in the aqueous humor was determined. The RAW 264.7 cells were pretreated with various concentrations of GBE for 24hr and subsequently incubated with LPS for 24hr. Levels of NO, PGE2 and TNF-alpha were determined by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. The expression of iNOS protein was analyzed by Western blotting method.
RESULTS: GBE treatment in vivo decreased the concentrations of protein and NO in the aqueous humor of EIU rats. The anti-inflammatory effect of 1 mg GBE was as strong as that of same dose prednisolone. It also significantly reduced the concentration of PGE2, TNF-alpha and NO production in the medium of RAW 264.7 cells compared to that of the LPS group in vitro. The expression of iNOS protein in the 1000 microg ml(-1) of GBE treated cells decreased significantly.
CONCLUSION: The present results indicate GBE suppresses the inflammation of EIU by blocking the iNOS protein expression and its anti-inflammatory effect on eye is comparable with the effect of prednisolone used in similar doses.",20,2004-Aug-1

To evaluate the outcome of trabeculectomy with antiproliferative agents in patients with uveitic glaucoma
METHODS: A retrospective chart review of 44 eyes of 44 patients with uveitic glaucoma who underwent trabeculectomy with mitomycin C or 5-fluorouracil. The authors defined complete success as an intraocular pressure of 21 mm Hg or lower without pressure-lowering medications, qualified success as an intraocular pressure of 21 mm Hg or lower with medications, and failure as an intraocular pressure of more than 21 mm Hg with medications, loss of light perception, or the need for reoperation.
RESULTS: The cumulative probability of complete or qualified success was 78% at 1 year and 62% at 2 years. At 2 years, success rates were 39% in males and 71% in females (P = 0.02), 74% in white patients and 55% in black patients (P = 0.58), and 45% in patients with idiopathic uveitis and 74% in patients with sarcoid uveitis (P = 0.17). Sixteen of 31 (51.6%) phakic patients developed new cataracts or had progression of existing cataracts and required cataract extraction. Four of 16 eyes (25%) lost intraocular pressure control and needed repeat trabeculectomy after undergoing cataract surgery.
CONCLUSIONS: Patients with uveitic glaucoma can have good outcomes after trabeculectomy with antiproliferative agents. Male gender was the only statistically significant risk factor for trabeculectomy failure. Cataract management in the presence of a filtering bleb poses a treatment dilemma between improvement of visual acuity and loss of intraocular pressure control.",20,2002-Jun-1

Equine recurrent uveitis (ERU) is the most serious eye disease in horses worldwide. Despite the fact that ERU is generally considered to be immune mediated, a detailed description of the histopathology of the posterior part of ERU eyes is lacking. Here, we examined sections of paraffin-embedded eyes using histological and immunhistological methods. Twenty seven eyes of 20 horses with ERU and 30 eyes of 15 healthy control horses were included in this study. We could consistently demonstrate an involvement of the retina and the choroid in all examined eyes of horses with spontaneous ERU. In eyes with minimal histopathological changes, the infiltrates consisted almost exclusively of T-cells. Histopathological changes start with the destruction of the photoreceptor outer segments, which often leads to focal retinal detachment. In more severely affected eyes, there is additional disintegration of the ganglion cell layer and the inner nuclear layer. In almost all examined eyes, lymphoid follicle formation could be demonstrated. Typical localizations of these follicles were the iris stroma and the choroid underneath the transition zone of the retina without photoreceptor cells to the region containing photoreceptor cells. These follicles consist of a T-cell rich periphery with a small center of CD3-negative lymphocytes. In cases with extreme histopathological changes, the retinal architecture is widely disintegrated with massive infiltration of the retina, the choroid, and the ciliary body by several types of inflammatory cells. Necrotic remnants of the retina are end-stage findings and there is only a minor inflammatory infiltration left. This study provides clear evidence that the retina is involved in all stages of ERU. Inflammation is mainly driven by T-cells as T-cells were demonstrated in mild stages of the disease and are also the predominating cell type in all other stages of ERU.",20,2002-Aug-1

To document the clinical presentation, treatment, and visual outcome of sarcoid uveitis and to determine the timing and potential risk factors of sarcoidosis progression to symptomatic systemic disease from the time of sarcoid uveitis diagnosis.
DESIGN: Retrospective, interventional case series.
METHODS: Subjects: Patients with dual diagnoses of uveitis and presumed/biopsy-proven sarcoidosis.
PROCEDURE: Retrospective review of 143 patient records from the Royal Victorian Eye and Ear Hospital and Eye Surgery Associates in Melbourne, Australia, between October 1990 and April 2014 coded with the dual diagnoses of uveitis and sarcoidosis. Only patients with uveitis and presumed or biopsy-proven sarcoidosis (N = 113) were included.
MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Ascertainment of rate and time (months) to the development of symptomatic systemic sarcoidosis from uveitis onset; comparison of the patient demographics, characteristics of uveitis, treatment, and visual outcome between those who developed systemic sarcoidosis and those who remained systemically asymptomatic.
RESULTS: Uveitis was the initial presenting complaint of sarcoidosis in 78.8% (n = 89). Twenty-three patients had concurrent undiagnosed systemic disease at presentation and 29 subsequently developed symptomatic sarcoidosis in an organ uninvolved at uveitis onset. The median time to the development of symptomatic systemic sarcoidosis was 12 months. No statistically significant association was ascertained between any particular uveitis characteristic and extraocular sarcoidosis progression.
CONCLUSION: Uveitis was the initial presentation of sarcoidosis in the vast majority of our subjects. Concurrent undiagnosed systemic sarcoidosis was common at the time of uveitis onset. A high index of suspicion for subsequent systemic progression should also be maintained, especially within the first 5 years of the uveitis diagnosis.",20,2019-Feb-1

To assess the prevalence of hypotony in patients with severe forms of uveitis.
METHODS: The Multicenter Uveitis Steroid Treatment (MUST) Trial, a randomized study, enrolled 255 patients. Patients with hypotony at the baseline visit were identified.
RESULTS: Twenty (8.3%) of 240 patients with sufficient data had hypotony. Hypotony was more common in patients with uveitis ≥5 years duration (odds ratio [OR] = 5.0; p < .01), and in eyes with a history of ocular surgery (vitrectomy vs. none, OR = 3.1; p = .03). Hypotony was less in patients with older age of uveitis onset (>51 years vs. <51 years, OR = 0.1; p = .02), in Caucasian patients (OR = 0.1; p < .01) compared to African American patients. Hypotonous eyes were more likely to have visual impairment (OR = 22.9; p < .01).
CONCLUSIONS: Hypotony is an important complication of uveitis and more commonly affects African-American patients, those with uveitis onset at a younger age, and those with longer disease duration. It is associated with visual impairment.",20,2012-Apr-1

The problems of Behçet's disease in Japan have been reviewed with particular emphasis on the ophthalmologic aspects: the historical background for the Japanese works, diagnostic critieria, epidemiology, some statistics, ocular symptomatology, ocular histopathology, etiology, pathophysiology, and treatment. Behçet's disease is the most frequent entity in endogenous uveitis in Japan. Patients are found throughout the country, and the prevalence rate averages seven to eight per 100,000 population: the rate is higher in the northern than in the southern districts. The diagnosis is made on the basis of a combination of clinical symptoms that are divided into the major and minor criteria symptoms. The major criteria comprise the ocular involvement, aphthous ulcers of the oral mucous membrane, genital ulcers, and skin lesions. These symptoms recur often as attacks and the disease follows a chronic course. The ocular involvement is found in 83% to 95% in males and 67% to 73% in females; the male to female ratio in the number of patients is 1.78. Both into the anterior segment type and the fundus and panophthalmic types. The anterior segment type shows serous iridocyclitis with the classic type of hypopyon appearing in about 12% of the attacks. This type is found in about 20%, more often in females than in males, and the visual prognosis is more favorable than in the fundus and panophthalmic types. In the latter two types, attacks of retinal angitis resulting in intensive retinal edema, yellowish-white exudate, and hemorrhages recur particularly in the macular region, and the visual prognosis is poor. More than 50% of male patients lose visual acuity to less than 0.1 in five years, but this is the case in only 10% of female patients. Consequently, Behçet's disease is the cause of blindness in about 12% of acquired blindness in adults. The ocular histopathology during the attack is characterized by severe angitis with intensive infiltration of neutrophil leucocytes largely in the uveal tract and the retina; the latter is severely affected and loss of visual cells and other neural elements results. The etiology of this disease still remains unknown but genetic predisposition is suggested since this disease is strongly linked with HL-A-B5. Environmental factors are also considered. Various abnormalities are found in the blood chemistry, blood cells (particularly in neutrophil leucocytes), immunologic mechanism, fibrinolytic and blood clotting system, and hormonal system. Chemotractic factors are found in the aqueous humor. These changes are particulary enhanced just before and during the ocular attacks. Systemic corticosteroids are deleterious to the visual prognosis, but cyclophosphamide and colchicine appear to suppress attacks and help patients maintain the visual acuity. However, these drugs are toxic, particulary to the reproductive organs, and the patients must be informed of this side effect and be allowed to make a decision before they are used.",20,1979-1-1

To characterize the risk and risk factors for intraocular pressure (IOP) elevation in pediatric noninfectious uveitis.
DESIGN: Multicenter retrospective cohort study.
PARTICIPANTS: Nine hundred sixteen children (1593 eyes) younger than 18 years at presentation with noninfectious uveitis followed up between January 1978 and December 2007 at 5 academic uveitis centers in the United States.
METHODS: Medical records review by trained, certified experts.
MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Prevalence and incidence of IOP of 21 mmHg or more and 30 mmHg or more and incidence of a rise in IOP by 10 mmHg or more. To avoid underascertainment, outcomes were counted as present when IOP-lowering therapies were in use.
RESULTS: Initially, 251 (15.8%) and 46 eyes (2.9%) had IOP ≥21 mmHg and ≥30 mmHg, respectively. Factors significantly associated with presenting IOP elevation included age of 6 to 12 years (versus other pediatric ages), prior cataract surgery, pars plana vitrectomy, duration of uveitis ≥6 months, contralateral IOP elevation, presenting visual acuity worse than 20/40, and topical corticosteroid use (in a dose-response relationship). The median follow-up was 1.25 years (interquartile range, 0.4-3.66). The estimated incidence of any observed IOP elevation to ≥21 mmHg, to ≥30 mmHg, and increase in IOP by ≥10 mmHg was 33.4%, 14.8%, and 24.4%, respectively, within 2 years. Factors associated with IOP elevation included pars plana vitrectomy, contralateral IOP elevation (adjusted hazard ratio [aHR], up to 9.54; P < 0.001), and the use of topical (aHR, up to 8.77 that followed a dose-response relationship; P < 0.001), periocular (aHR, up to 7.96; P < 0.001), and intraocular (aHR, up to 19.7; P < 0.001) corticosteroids.
CONCLUSIONS: Intraocular pressure elevation affects a large minority of children with noninfectious uveitis. Statistically significant risk factors include IOP elevation or use of IOP-lowering treatment in the contralateral eye and local corticosteroid use that demonstrated a dose-and route of administration-dependent relationship. In contrast, use of immunosuppressive drug therapy did not increase such risk. Pediatric eyes with noninfectious uveitis should be followed up closely for IOP elevation, especially when strong risk factors such as the use of local corticosteroids and contralateral IOP elevation are present.",20,2015-Oct-1

To determine whether infliximab induces the development of Foxp3+ T regulatory (Treg) cells in patients with Behçet's disease.
METHODS: The subjects were patients with refractory uveitis caused by Behçet's disease, Vogt-Koyanagi-Harada disease, or ocular toxoplasmosis and healthy volunteers. Purified CD4+ T cells were obtained from patients with uveitis who were treated with colchicine, cyclosporine, or infliximab. Flow cytometry was used to analyze the expression of Foxp3 on CD4+ T cells.
RESULTS: Foxp3 was expressed in a small percentage of CD4+ T cells (<5%) from healthy subjects and from patients with active uveitis caused by Behçet's disease, Vogt-Koyanagi-Harada disease, or ocular toxoplasmosis. The percentage of Foxp3+ cells among CD4+ T cells was significantly decreased in patients with active uveitis compared with patients with inactive uveitis in the remission stage. Foxp3 was expressed at a similar level in CD4+ T cells from healthy donors, colchicine-treated patients, and cyclosporine-treated patients, whereas infliximab-treated patients expressed much higher percentages of Foxp3+ cells. Patients who had a high population of Foxp3+ cells during infliximab treatment did not experience any subsequent episodes of acute uveitis. On the other hand, patients with a low population of Foxp3+ cells did experience ocular inflammatory episodes. T cells exposed to infliximab in vitro greatly expressed Foxp3 and produced TGFβ, and the Treg cells significantly suppressed the activation of bystander T cells in vitro.
CONCLUSIONS: Anti-TNF-α therapy may be useful for patients with ocular complications of Behçet's disease who have a decreased percentage of peripheral Treg cells.",20,2011-Jan-21

Uveitis is characterized by intraocular inflammation involving the uveal tract; its etiologies generally fall into two broad categories: autoimmune/inflammatory or infectious. Corticosteroids  are a powerful and important class of medications ubiquitous in the treatment of uveitis. They may be given systemically or locally, in the form of topical drops, periocular injection, intravitreal suspension, or intravitreal implant. This review describes each of the currently available corticosteroid treatment options for uveitis, including favorable and unfavorable characteristics of each as well as applicable clinical trials. The main advantage of corticosteroids as a whole is their ability to quickly and effectively control inflammation early on in the course of uveitis. However, they can have serious side effects, whether localized to the eye (such as cataract and elevated intraocular pressure) or systemic (such as osteonecrosis and adrenal insufficiency) and in the majority of cases of uveitis are not an appropriate option for long-term therapy.",20,2020-Jun-1

To investigate the presence of biomarkers in aqueous humor (AH) from patients with uveitis associated with juvenile idiopathic arthritis (JIA).
METHODS: AH (N = 73) AND SERUM (N = 105) SAMPLES FROM 116 CHILDREN WERE ANALYZED USING SURFACE ENHANCED LASER DESORPTION/IONIZATION TIME OF FLIGHT MASS SPECTROMETRY (SELDI-TOF MS).
THE SAMPLES WERE DIVIDED INTO THE FOLLOWING GROUPS: JIA, silent chronic anterior uveitis (AU), other uveitis entities, and noninflammatory controls. Statistical biomarker identification was performed using the SELDI-ToF Biomarker Analysis Cluster Wizard followed by multivariate statistical analysis. Biochemical identification of biomarkers was performed by polyacrylamide gel protein separation, followed by liquid chromatography tandem mass spectrometry. ELISA was performed in a number of AH samples representing all four study groups.
RESULTS: In the JIA group, one AH protein peak at mass/charge (m/z) 13,762 had qualitative and quantitative differences in expression compared with the other uveitis entities and the controls, but not to the group of silent chronic AU. Its quantitative expression in AH of patients with JIA and other silent chronic AU was positively associated with uveitis activity. The protein at m/z 13,762 in AH was identified as transthyretin (TTR). The TTR concentration in AH differed significantly between the study groups (P = 0.006) with considerably higher TTR concentrations in JIA and silent chronic AU samples positive for m/z 13,762 than those of the other uveitis and control groups.
CONCLUSIONS: TTR is a potential intraocular biomarker of JIA- associated uveitis. Its role in the pathogenesis of silent chronic AU with and without arthritis needs further investigation.",20,2013-May-01

We tested the long-term effects of different regimens of mesenchymal stem cell (MSC) administration in a recurrent experimental autoimmune uveitis (rEAU) model in rats, and compared the efficacy of MSC to that of dexamethasone (DEX).
METHODS: One or two courses of MSC treatments were applied to R16-specific T cell-induced rEAU rats before or after disease onsets. The DEX injections were given for 7 or 50 days continuously after disease onsets. Clinical appearances were observed until the 50th day after transfer. On the 10th day, T cells from control and MSC groups were analyzed by flow cytometry. Supernatants from the proliferation assay and aqueous humor were collected for cytokine detection. Functions of T cells and APCs in spleens also were studied by lymphocyte proliferation assays.
RESULTS: One course of MSC therapy, administered after disease onset, led to a lasting therapeutic effect, with a decreased incidence, reduced mean clinical score, and reduced retinal impairment after 50 days of observation, while multiple courses of treatment did not improve the therapeutic benefit. Although DEX and MSCs equally reduced the severity of the first episode of rEAU, the effect of DEX was shorter lasting, and DEX therapy failed to control the disease even with long periods of treatment. The MSCs significantly decreased T helper 1 (Th1) and Th17 responses, suppressed the function of antigen-presenting cells, and upregulated T regulatory cells.
CONCLUSIONS: These results suggested that MSCs might be new corticosteroid spring agents, while providing fewer side effects and longer lasting suppressive effects for recurrent uveitis.",20,2014-Aug-14

To investigate whether transforming growth factor-beta 2 (TGF-beta 2), a strong immunosuppressive factor normally present in aqueous humor, is involved in the inflammatory process of clinical uveitis.
METHODS: Mature TGF-beta 2 levels were determined in aqueous humor samples of 9 patients with Fuchs' heterochromic cyclitis, aqueous humor samples of 21 patients with other uveitis entities, and vitreous fluid samples of 19 patients with uveitis by using a commercially available sandwich ELISA: Total TGF-beta 2 levels in ocular fluids were measured after heat activation. Aqueous humor samples from patients with cataract and glaucoma and vitreous fluid samples from eye bank eyes were tested as controls. Albumin levels, determined by radial immunodiffusion, were used as a measure of the disruption of the blood aqueous barrier.
RESULTS: Significantly lower mature TGF-beta 2 levels were detected in aqueous humor samples of patients with uveitis, compared to the two control groups without intraocular inflammation. Samples of patients with uveitis without detectable mature TGF-beta 2 did contain latent TGF-beta 2 levels (504 to 6024 pg/ml). In aqueous humor, there was a significant negative correlation between mature TGF-beta 2 and albumin levels. No mature TGF-beta could be detected in vitreous fluid. Total TGF-beta 2 levels in vitreous fluid were significantly lower in samples from patients with uveitis than in samples from eye bank eyes.
CONCLUSION: These results indicate that the mature TGF-beta 2 levels in aqueous humor and the total TGF-beta 2 levels in vitreous fluid are reduced during ocular inflammation. In aqueous humor, this might be caused by binding of mature TGF-beta to serum proteins, for instance, alpha 2-macroglobulin, or by a disturbance in the activation process of latent TGF-beta 2.",20,1994-Sep-1

A single injection of 100 micrograms of lipopolysaccharide from Salmonella typhimurium in the foot pads of Lewis rats induced acute inflammation of the eye. Clinically, the disease started as early as 0.5 h and peaked 18 h after the inoculation. The aqueous protein concentration was increased after the inoculation. Histopathologically, cellular infiltrates and proteinaceous exudates were observed in the anterior segment (anterior chamber, iris and ciliary body). In addition to those changes described in previous reports, the examination of the posterior segment showed retinal vasculitis, hemorrhagic exudates, focal destruction of photoreceptor cells and choroidal infiltration.",20,1992-1-1

This review surveys publications from peer-reviewed literature published since 2001on the matter of uveitis associated with juvenile idiopathic arthritis.
RECENT FINDINGS: Uveitis associated with juvenile idiopathic arthritis (JIA) continues to blind substantial numbers of children every year, even in the most developed of societies. This is so because of delayed diagnosis (as a consequence of the silent, asymptomatic nature of ocular inflammation in some patients), and because of delayed referral by general ophthalmologists of children with JIA-associated uveitis to ocular immunologists prepared to move on to systemic immunomodulatory therapy in those instances where the child's uveitis is chronic or continues to recur with each attempt at tapering corticosteroid. The evidence for this is vast.
SUMMARY: Progress in the matter of reducing the prevalence of blindness secondary to this disease will require the increasing willingness of the world's ophthalmologists to refer patients with JIA-associated uveitis much earlier in the course of his or her disease for consideration of immunomodulatory therapy, and will require legislation mandating visual acuity testing in children attending day care centers.",19,2003-Dec-1

The purpose of this study was to determine classification criteria for multiple evanescent white dot syndrome (MEWDS).
DESIGN: Machine learning of cases with MEWDS and 8 other posterior uveitides.
METHODS: Cases of posterior uveitides were collected in an informatics-designed preliminary database, and a final database was constructed of cases achieving supermajority agreement on diagnosis using formal consensus techniques. Cases were split into a training set and a validation set. Machine learning using multinomial logistic regression was used in the training set to determine a parsimonious set of criteria that minimized the misclassification rate among the infectious posterior, or panuveitides. The resulting criteria were evaluated in the validation set.
RESULTS: A total of 1,068 cases of posterior uveitides, including 51 cases of MEWDS, were evaluated by machine learning. Key criteria for MEWDS included: 1) multifocal gray-white chorioretinal spots with foveal granularity; 2) characteristic imaging on fluorescein angiography (""wreath-like"" hyperfluorescent lesions) and/or optical coherence tomography (hyper-reflective lesions extending from retinal pigment epithelium through ellipsoid zone into the retinal outer nuclear layer); and 3) absent to mild anterior chamber and vitreous inflammation. Overall accuracy for posterior uveitides was 93.9% in the training set and 98.0% (95% confidence interval: 94.3-99.3) in the validation set. Misclassification rates for MEWDS were 7% in the training set and 0% in the validation set.
CONCLUSIONS: The criteria for MEWDS had a low misclassification rate and appeared to perform sufficiently well for use in clinical and translational research.",19,2021-Aug-1

To evaluate the success of single-agent immunosuppression for patients with the posterior uveitides, birdshot chorioretinitis, multifocal choroiditis with panuveitis, and punctate inner choroiditis.
DESIGN: Retrospective case series.
METHODS: setting: Tertiary care uveitis practices. population: Patients initiated on immunomodulatory therapy. intervention: Patients were treated with prednisone 1 mg/kg and mycophenolate 2 g daily. Prednisone was tapered after 1 month. Immunosuppression was escalated to mycophenolate 3 g daily, with addition of a second agent, as needed, to achieve treatment success. outcome measure: Treatment success, defined as no disease activity with prednisone dose ≤10 mg daily, at 6, 12, and 24 months.
RESULTS: Twenty-seven patients were followed. Mean presentation and 2-year follow-up acuities were 20/41 and 20/42, respectively. For birdshot chorioretinitis, mean (±standard deviation) quantitative Goldmann visual field scores improved from 761 ± 69 degrees (IV/4 isopter) and 496 ± 115 degrees (I/4 isopter) at presentation to 784 ± 57 degrees and 564 ± 125 degrees, respectively. Prednisone was successfully tapered in 95% of patients; mean prednisone doses at 1 and 2 years were 5.3 ± 4.1 and 5.7 ± 4.8 mg/day, respectively. At 2 years, prednisone was discontinued in 11% of patients. Treatment success was achieved in 74% of patients on 1 immunosuppressant, and in an additional 21% of patients on 2 agents, for an overall 95% success rate at 2 years.
CONCLUSIONS: Posterior uveitides can be treated with 1 agent in most patients, but the data suggest a need to escalate therapy to higher mycophenolate doses, and in one fifth of cases to add a second agent to maintain disease suppression with acceptably low prednisone doses.",19,2014-Dec-1

Glaucoma is a potentially blinding complication of uveitis, where intraocular inflammation, secondary corticosteroid response, and varying types and degrees of angle abnormalities contribute to its pathogenesis. Management of uveitic glaucoma remains challenging. Treatment is targeted at reducing the inflammation and lowering the intraocular pressure. Recent studies have highlighted the role of viruses, such as cytomegalovirus, herpes simplex virus, and more recently Ebola virus, in the pathogenesis of uveitic glaucoma. Antiviral therapy may be beneficial in eyes with detectable viral DNA. The success of glaucoma surgery is decreased in eyes with uveitic glaucoma, and surgical interventions are associated with a higher incidence of postoperative complications. Novel glaucoma surgical and laser treatments may improve the predictability of surgery for uveitic glaucoma, but these require further evaluation.",19,2015-1-1

To report the course of uveitis disease activity during pregnancy and the postpartum period in women with noninfectious uveitis.
DESIGN: Observational case series.
METHODS: The medical records of women with noninfectious uveitis and pregnancy during follow-up at a large eye hospital were retrospectively reviewed. Patients with pregnancy were included in the study if follow-up was adequate to document the presence or absence of flare-ups in uveitis activity during the pregnancy and/or postpartum period.
RESULTS: Seventy-six pregnancies among 50 women were included in the study. Thirty-three pregnancies were in women with Vogt-Koyanagi-Harada disease, 19 were in women with Behcet disease, and 24 were in women with idiopathic uveitis. A flare-up in uveitis activity occurred within the first 4 months of pregnancy in 49 of 76 cases (64%) and later in pregnancy in 17 cases (22%); no flare-up occurred during pregnancy in 21 cases (28%). An early pregnancy flare-up was typical of Vogt-Koyanagi-Harada disease and idiopathic uveitis. A flare-up within 6 months of delivery occurred in 38 of 59 cases (64%) that had adequate examination data available from the postpartum period. The postpartum flare-up was especially typical of Behcet disease.
CONCLUSIONS: Many women with noninfectious uveitis will experience a flare-up in disease activity within the first 4 months of pregnancy. Later pregnancy appears to be a time of relative disease inactivity. Many will experience a rebound in activity within 6 months of delivery.",19,2003-Jul-1

Diagnosis of intraocular-central nervous system (CNS) lymphoma is commonly made by identifying malignant lymphocytes in the vitreous. However, such cells are in the minority in the vitreous cellular infiltrate (most are reactive lymphocytes), and therefore lack of cytologic support from biopsied vitreous samples in patients suspected of having intraocular-CNS lymphoma may occur. Recent data suggest that interleukin-10 (IL-10) levels are elevated in the serum and vitreous of patients with non-Hodgkin's lymphoma, whereas IL-12 and IL-6 levels are elevated in patients with uveitis of non-neoplastic etiology. The authors evaluated the usefulness of measuring vitreous levels of IL-6, -10, and -12 in the diagnosis of intraocular-CNS lymphoma.
DESIGN: Prospective case series.
PARTICIPANTS: Seventeen patients with intraocular inflammation who underwent a diagnostic or therapeutic vitrectomy: 4 patients with intraocular-CNS lymphoma and 13 patients with uveitis unrelated to a neoplasm.
INTERVENTION: Eighteen vitreous specimens were obtained prospectively. Concentrations of IL-6, -10, and -12 were measured by enzyme immunosorbent assay, and relative ratios of the interleukins were calculated. Cytopathologic examination and flow cytometry of vitreous cells were also performed.
MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: The ratio of IL-10/IL-12 and IL-10/IL-6 was calculated to assess any association of intraocular-CNS lymphoma and high vitreous IL-10 relative to IL-6 and IL-12 levels.
RESULTS: The IL-10/IL-6 and IL-10/IL-12 ratio was greater than 1 in 8 of 14 vitreous specimens obtained from 13 patients with non-neoplastic uveitis. One of the four specimens from patients with cytologically proven intraocular-CNS lymphoma had vitreous IL-10/IL-6 and IL-10/IL-12 ratios of less than 1.
CONCLUSION: Although a helpful diagnostic tool, an elevated vitreous IL-10 to IL-6 or IL-12 ratio is not always associated with intraocular-CNS lymphoma.",19,1999-Dec-1

Inflammatory leukocyte accumulation is a common feature of major ocular diseases, such as uveitis, diabetic retinopathy, and age-related macular degeneration. Vascular adhesion protein-1 (VAP-1), a cell surface and soluble molecule that possesses semicarbazide-sensitive amine oxidase (SSAO) activity, is involved in leukocyte recruitment. However, the expression of VAP-1 in the eye and its contribution to ocular inflammation are unknown. Here, we investigated the role of VAP-1 in an established model of ocular inflammation, the endotoxin-induced uveitis (EIU), using a novel and specific inhibitor. Our inhibitor has a half-maximal inhibitory concentration (IC(50)) of 0.007 microM against human and 0.008 microM against rat SSAO, while its IC(50) against the functionally related monoamine oxidase (MAO) -A and MAO-B is >10 microM. In the retina, VAP-1 was exclusively expressed in the vasculature, and its expression level was elevated during EIU. VAP-1 inhibition in EIU animals significantly suppressed leukocyte recruitment to the anterior chamber, vitreous, and retina, as well as retinal endothelial P-selectin expression. Our data suggest an important role for VAP-1 in the recruitment of leukocytes to the immune-privileged ocular tissues during acute inflammation. VAP-1 inhibition may become a novel strategy in the treatment of ocular inflammatory diseases.",19,2008-Apr-1

Equine recurrent uveitis (ERU) is an inflammatory eye disease with high similarity to uveitis in man. It is the only spontaneous animal model for uveitis and the most frequent eye disease in horses affecting up to 10% of the population. To further investigate the pathophysiology of ERU we now report the establishment of an inducible uveitis model in horses. An ERU-like disease was elicited in seven out of seven horses by injection of interphotoreceptor retinoid-binding protein (IRBP) in complete Freund's adjuvant. Control horses did not develop uveitis. The disease model is characterized by a highly reproducible disease course and recurrent episodes with an identical time course elicited in all horses by repeated IRBP injections. The histology revealed the formation of lymphoid follicle-like structures in the eyes and an intraocular infiltration dominated by CD3(+) lymphocytes, morphological patterns typical for the spontaneous disease. Antigen-specific T cell proliferation of PBL was monitored prior to clinical uveitis and during disease episodes. An initial T cell response to IRBP-derived peptides was followed by epitope spreading to S-antigen-derived peptides in response to subsequent immunizations. Thus, horse experimental uveitis represents a valuable disease model for comparative studies with the spontaneous disease and the investigation of immunomodulatory therapeutic approaches after onset of the disease.",19,2002-Sep-1

To analyze the clinical and visual outcome of 55 consecutive patients with juvenile idiopathic arthritis (JIA)-associated uveitis examined 7 and 24 years after the onset of the eye disease.
METHODS: A retrospective study.
RESULTS: Fifty-five out of 350 patients with JIA developed uveitis (15.7%). Forty-six (84%) of these had oligoarthritis, 6 (11%) had polyarthritis, and 3(5%) had systemic disease. Cataract was present in 42% at 7 years and in 51% at 24 years. Uveitic glaucoma was present in 5% at 7 years and in 22% at 24 years. After 24 years, 27 patients (49%) still had active uveitis.
CONCLUSIONS: In half of these patients the uveitis was still active after 24 years of eye disease. In the group of patients with active disease, cataract and secondary glaucoma increased significantly between years 7 and 24 of disease.",19,2009-1-1

To assess the evidence that pars plana vitrectomy (PPV) is useful in improving vision, reducing disease activity, or ameliorating cystoid macular edema (CME) in patients with uveitis.
DESIGN: Review of the literature.
METHODS: A Medline search was conducted for relevant articles published in English, German, or French. Articles were analyzed for content and evidence level.
RESULTS: A total of 44 interventional case series published between 1981 and 2005 were identified that included 1575 patients (1762 eyes). Evidence level was grade CII-3 indicating possibly improved clinical outcomes with fair or poor evidence. The average age of patients was 36 years with a median duration of uveitis before surgery of 48 months and a median follow-up of 1.9 years. Intermediate uveitis was present in 841 eyes. Cystoid macular edema and cataract were common co-morbidities, and there were large numbers of additional surgical procedures. Visual outcomes in 39 articles were stated as improved in 708 eyes (68%), unchanged in 202 eyes (20%), and worsened in 124 eyes (12%). Reduction in systemic medication following PPV was reported in 25 studies. The median reported percentage of patients per study with CME was 36% preoperatively and 18% postoperatively.
CONCLUSIONS: Based on the evidence in the literature, PPV is possibly relevant to the outcomes of improving vision and reducing inflammation and CME. Randomized, controlled, collaborative trials or hypothesis-based case series with precise outcome measures that incorporate control groups would improve the quality of evidence supporting PPV as an adjunct to the medical treatment of uveitis.",19,2005-Dec-1

Reactive gliosis is a well-established response to virtually every retinal disease. Autoimmune uveitis, a sight threatening disease, is characterized by recurrent relapses through autoaggressive T-cells. The purpose of this study was to assess retinal Müller glial cell function in equine recurrent uveitis (ERU), a spontaneous disease model resembling the human disease, by investigating membrane proteins implicated in ion and water homeostasis. We found that Kir2.1 was highly expressed in diseased retinas, whereas Kir4.1 was downregulated in comparison to controls. Distribution of Kir2.1 appeared Müller cell associated in controls, whereas staining of cell somata in the inner nuclear layer was observed in uveitis. In contrast to other subunits, Kir4.1 was evenly expressed along equine Müller cells, whereas in ERU, Kir4.1 almost disappeared from Müller cells. Hence, we suggest a different mechanism for potassium buffering in the avascular equine retina and, moreover, an impairment in uveitis. Uveitic retinas showed significantly increased expression of AQP4 as well as a displaced expression from Müller cells in healthy specimens to an intense circular expression pattern in the outer nuclear layer in ERU cases. Most interestingly, we detected the aquaporin family member protein AQP5 to be expressed in Müller cells with strong enrichments in Müller cell secondary processes. This finding indicates that fluid regulation within the equine retina may be achieved by an additional aquaporin. Furthermore, AQP5 was significantly decreased in uveitis. We conclude that the Müller cell response in autoimmune uveitis implies considerable changes in its potassium and water physiology.",19,2011-May-1

This study aimed to investigate the predisposition of common pre-miRNA SNPs with Behcet's disease (BD), Vogt-Koyanagi-Harada (VKH) syndrome and acute anterior uveitis (AAU) associated with ankylosing spondylitis (AS). A two-stage association study was carried out in 859 BD, 400 VKH syndrome, 209 AAU(+)AS(+) patients and 1,685 controls all belonging to a Chinese Han population. Genotyping, the expression of miR-196a and Bach1 (the target gene of miR-196a), cell proliferation, cytokine production were examined by PCR-RFLP, real-time PCR, CCK8 and ELISA. In the first stage study, the results showed significantly increased frequencies of the miR-196a2/rs11614913 TT genotype and T allele in BD patients (adjusted P(c) = 0.024, OR = 1.63; adjusted P(c) = 5.4 × 10(-3), OR = 1.45, respectively). However, no significant association of the tested SNPs with VKH and AAU(+)AS(+) patients was observed. The second stage and combined studies confirmed the association of rs11614913 with BD (TT genotype: adjusted P(c) = 6×10(-5), OR = 1.53; T allele: adjusted P(c) = 8×10(-6), OR = 1.35; CC genotype: adjusted P(c) = 0.024, OR = 0.68). A stratified analysis showed an association of the rs11614913 TT genotype and T allele with the arthritis subgroup of BD (P(c) = 5.3 × 10(-3), OR = 1.89; P(c) = 0.015, OR = 1.56, respectively). Functional experiments showed a decreased miR-196a expression, an increased Bach1 expression and an increased production of IL-1β and MCP-1 in TT cases compared to CC cases (P = 0.023, P = 0.0073, P = 0.012, P = 0.002, respectively). This study shows that a functional variant of miR-196a2 confers risk for BD but not for VKH syndrome or AAU(+)AS(+) by modulating the miR-196a gene expression and by regulating pro-inflammatory IL-1β and MCP-1 production.",19,2013-Dec-1

Juvenile idiopathic arthritis (JIA) is the commonest rheumatic disease in children and JIA-associated uveitis its most frequent extra-articular manifestation. The uveitis is potentially sight-threatening and thus carries a considerable risk of morbidity with associated reduction in quality of life. The commonest form of uveitis seen in association with JIA is chronic anterior uveitis, which is almost always asymptomatic in the initial stages. Therefore, screening for JIA-associated uveitis in at-risk patients is essential. The aim of early detection and treatment is to minimise intraocular inflammation and to avoid complications that lead to visual loss, which can result from both disease activity and medications. The sight-threatening complications of JIA-associated uveitis include cataracts, glaucoma, band keratopathy, and macular oedema. There is increasing evidence for the early introduction of systemic immunosuppressive therapies to reduce topical and systemic use of glucocorticoids. A recently published randomised controlled trial of adalimumab in JIA-associated uveitis now provides convincing evidence for the use of this biologic in patients who fail to respond adequately to methotrexate. Tocilizumab and abatacept are being investigated as alternatives in children inadequately treated with anti-tumour necrosis factor drugs.",19,2017-Aug-1

Uveitis is a major cause of sight loss across the world. The reliable assessment of intraocular inflammation in uveitis ('disease activity') is essential in order to score disease severity and response to treatment. In this review, we describe how 'quantitative imaging', the approach of using automated analysis and measurement algorithms across both standard and emerging imaging modalities, can develop objective instrument-based measures of disease activity.
METHODS: This is a narrative review based on searches of the current world literature using terms related to quantitative imaging techniques in uveitis, supplemented by clinical trial registry data, and expert knowledge of surrogate endpoints and outcome measures in ophthalmology.
RESULTS: Current measures of disease activity are largely based on subjective clinical estimation, and are relatively insensitive, with poor discrimination and reliability. The development of quantitative imaging in uveitis is most established in the use of optical coherence tomographic (OCT) measurement of central macular thickness (CMT) to measure severity of macular edema (ME). The transformative effect of CMT in clinical assessment of patients with ME provides a paradigm for the development and impact of other forms of quantitative imaging. Quantitative imaging approaches are now being developed and validated for other key inflammatory parameters such as anterior chamber cells, vitreous haze, retinovascular leakage, and chorioretinal infiltrates.
CONCLUSIONS: As new forms of quantitative imaging in uveitis are proposed, the uveitis community will need to evaluate these tools against the current subjective clinical estimates and reach a new consensus for how disease activity in uveitis should be measured. The development, validation, and adoption of sensitive and discriminatory measures of disease activity is an unmet need that has the potential to transform both drug development and routine clinical care for the patient with uveitis.",19,2017-May-01

Behçet's disease is a chronic multisystem disorder characterized by relapsing inflammation for which the underlying histopathology is an occlusive vasculitis. The disease has a high prevalence in the Mediterranean region, Far and Middle Eastern countries. It is clinically characterized by oral and genital ulcerations, ocular inflammatory involvement, skin lesions, vascular involvement and numerous other systemic manifestations. Uveitis is by far the most common ocular manifestation of Behçet's disease. It typically presents in the form of relapsing-remitting panuveitis with retinal vasculitis that may result in severe visual loss. Management of Behçet's uveitis relies on corticosteroid therapy, conventional immunosuppressive drugs and biological agents and requires a close collaboration between ophthalmologist and internist. A better understanding of auto-inflammatory process and of the role of cytokines implicated in the pathogenesis of Behçet's disease will enable researchers to develop more specific and effective therapy.",19,2019-Apr-1

Paraproteinemic crystalline keratopathy is an uncommon complication of multiple myeloma and other plasma cell dyscrasias. A case of 16 years' duration was associated with an IgG kappa monoclonal gammopathy and recurrent uveitis. The corneal changes were unusually extensive and distributed throughout all corneal layers. The deposits consisted of diffuse, small, polymorphic aggregates, which were iridescent in the superficial cornea, mat elsewhere, and associated with a diffuse stromal haze; specular microscopy showed additional features. Both corneas were thickened. The deposits failed to stain histochemically, except patchily with Masson Trichrome. There was extensive immunohistochemical labeling for IgG, kappa, and surprisingly, lambda. Ultrastructurally, pleomorphic deposits were found in every corneal cell; paracrystalline deposits with internal banding were seen only in the basal epithelium. Keratocytes and endothelial cells were damaged and reduced in number. Disease recurred in a corneal graft. Three main types of paraproteinemic keratopathy can be distinguished. The deposits probably represent various metabolic products of the monoclonal protein. This is not necessarily a benign condition; hematologic control may be necessary on purely ophthalmological criteria.",19,1988-Feb-1

To determine the prevalence and outcome of chronic uveitis in patients with juvenile rheumatoid arthritis (JRA).
METHODS: A retrospective analysis of 760 patients with JRA followed in 4 pediatric rheumatology centers. Patients with chronic uveitis were identified and their medical and ophthalmologic records were reviewed.
RESULTS: Seventy-four patients with uveitis were identified. The prevalence of uveitis was 9.3%. The mean interval from the onset of JRA to the onset of uveitis was 21 months, and 90% of the patients who developed uveitis did so within the first 4 years of their disease. Visual complications (synechiae, band keratopathy, cataract, or glaucoma) developed in 31% of the patients with uveitis. Complications were more common in patients who presented with uveitis early in the course of their JRA. Complications were also more common in antinuclear antibody (ANA) negative than in ANA positive patients. Visual loss to 20/50 or worse occurred in only 11% of patients with uveitis, and no patient became blind.
CONCLUSION: In a very large cohort of patients with JRA, uveitis was uncommon and poor visual outcome was rare. Visual complications did not necessarily result in a poor outcome.",19,1997-Oct-1

Viral anterior uveitis (VAU) needs to be suspected in anterior uveitis (AU) associated with elevated intraocular pressure, corneal involvement, and iris atrophic changes. Common etiologies of VAU include herpes simplex, varicella-zoster, cytomegalovirus, and rubella virus. Clinical presentations can vary from granulomatous AU with corneal involvement, Posner-Schlossman syndrome, Fuchs uveitis syndrome, and endothelitis. Due to overlapping clinical manifestations between the different viruses, diagnostic tests like polymerase chain reaction and Goldmann-Witmer coefficient analysis on the aqueous humor may help in identifying etiology to plan and monitor treatment.",19,2020-Sep-1

RESULTS: Mean age at onset of uveitis was 8.54 +/- 3.98 years; 54.5% of the patients were girls. Anterior uveitis occurred in 47.8%, intermediate in 19.4%, posterior in 24.9%, panuveitis in 7.8%. Ocular involvement was bilateral in 67.8%. Infectious uveitis represented 31% of all cases. Causes of severe visual loss were cataract, macular scars, macular edema/maculopathy, and secondary glaucoma. At follow-up 79.3% of eyes maintained a visual acuity between 20/32 and 20/20.
CONCLUSIONS: Uveitis is rarer in children than in adults. Patients with anterior uveitis comprised the largest group. Posterior uveitis in the pediatric population has a lower incidence than some decades ago. Visual prognosis of pediatric uveitis is improving, owing to an earlier diagnosis and a correct treatment.",19,2009-1-1

To retrospectively assess the frequency of ocular relapse and the possibility of long-term remission in patients treated with interferon (IFN) for severe uveitis associated with Behçet disease.
METHODS: All patients were treated with an initial dosage of 3 million IU IFN three times a week. The main outcome measure was the number of relapses per person per year before, during, and after IFN treatment.
RESULTS: Of 36 patients (67 eyes), 31 (86.1%) responded to IFN. The mean follow-up was 8.19 years. Twenty-one out of 36 patients discontinued IFN and 76% of these have not relapsed within 5.05 years after discontinuation. The mean relapse per person per year decreased significantly from 1.39 to 0.0496 (p = 1.82×10
CONCLUSION: IFN efficiently decreases the relapse rate and seems to permit long-term remission even after discontinuation.",19,2017-Feb-1

Mouse models of experimental autoimmune uveitis (EAU) mimic unique features of human uveitis, and serve as a template for preclinical study. The ""classical"" EAU model is induced by active immunization of mice with the retinal protein IRBP in adjuvant, and has proved to be a useful tool to study basic mechanisms and novel therapy in human uveitis. Several spontaneous models of uveitis induced by autoreactive T cells targeting on IRBP have been recently developed in IRBP specific TCR transgenic mice (R161H) and in AIRE(-/-) mice. The ""classical"" immunization-induced EAU exhibits acute ocular inflammation with two distinct patterns: (i) severe monophasic form with extensive destruction of the retina and rapid loss of visual function, and (ii) lower grade form with an acute onset followed by a prolonged chronic phase of disease. The spontaneous models of uveitis in R161H and AIRE(-/-) mice have a gradual onset and develop chronic ocular inflammation that ultimately leads to retinal degeneration, along with a progressive decline of visual signal. The adjuvant-dependent model and adjuvant-free spontaneous models represent distinct aspects and/or various forms of human uveitis. This review will discuss and compare clinical manifestations, pathology as well as visual function of the retina in the different models of uveitis, as measured by fundus imaging and histology, optical coherence tomography (OCT) and electroretinography (ERG).",19,2015-1-1

Equine recurrent uveitis is a severe and frequent blinding disease in horses which presents with auto-reactive invading T-cells, resulting in the destruction of the inner eye. Infiltration of inflammatory cells into the retina and vitreous is driven by currently unknown guidance cues, however surgical removal of the vitreous (vitrectomy) has proven therapeutically successful. Therefore, proteomic analyses of vitrectomy samples are likely to result in detection of proteins contributing to disease pathogenesis. Vitreous from healthy and ERU diseased horses were directly compared by quantitative mass spectrometry based on label-free quantification of peak intensities across samples. We found a significant upregulation of complement and coagulation cascades and downregulation of negative paracrine regulators of canonical Wnt signalling including the Wnt signalling inhibitors DKK3 and SFRP2. Based on immunohistochemistry, both proteins are expressed in equine retina and suggest localisation to retinal Müller glial cells (RMG), which may be the source cells for these proteins. Furthermore, retinal expression levels and patterns of DKK3 change in response to ERU. Since many other regulated proteins identified here are associated with RMG cells, these cells qualify as the prime responders to autoimmune triggers.",19,2012-Jul-19

This review aims to summarize the current knowledge concerning the clinical features, diagnostic work-up and therapeutic approach of ocular toxoplasmosis focusing mainly on the postnatally acquired form of the disease.
METHODS: A meticulous literature search was performed in the PubMed database. A supplementary search was made in Google Scholar to complete the collected items.
RESULTS: Ocular toxoplasmosis is one of the most frequent infectious etiologies of posterior uveitis. It typically presents with retinochoroiditis. Setting an accurate diagnosis depends to a considerable degree on detecting characteristic clinical characteristics. In addition to the evaluation of clinical features, the diagnosis of toxoplasmosis relies at a large degree on serologic testing. The detection of the parasite DNA in the aqueous or vitreous humor can provide evidence for a definitive diagnosis. The current mainstay for the treatment, if necessary, is the use of oral antibiotic with systemic corticosteroids. Recent evidence suggests other therapeutic approaches, such as intravitreal antibiotics can be used.
CONCLUSION: Recent developments in the diagnostic and therapeutic approach have contributed to preventing or limiting vision loss of patients suffering from ocular toxoplasmosis. Further studies are required to provide a better understanding of epidemiology, pathogenesis, diagnosis, and treatment with a significant impact on the management of this challenging clinical entity.",19,2022-Jan-1

Cyclosporin A has been shown to be an effective inhibitor of T cell-mediated diseases. We show here that cyclosporin A was capable of totally preventing the clinical appearance of experimental autoimmune uveitis in Lewis rats, even when administered on an every-other-day schedule (10 mg/kg) or when begun seven days after immunization (40 mg/kg). At lower doses of the drug, a modulation of the disease was seen with evidence of a more chronic, granulomatous process. A long-lasting unresponsive state to the immunizing antigen was not uniformly induced with cyclosporin A if therapy was begun seven days after S antigen immunization. Because of cyclosporin A's effective control of this experimental model that is induced by an antigen to which certain patients with uveitis demonstrate cell-mediated immune responses, cyclosporin A may be an effective mode of therapy for T cell-mediated intraocular inflammatory disease.",19,1982-Jul-1

Juvenile idiopathic arthritis (JIA) is the most common systemic disease causing uveitis in childhood, with a prevalence of 10 per 100 000 persons. JIA often takes a severe inflammatory course, and its complications often endanger vision.
METHODS: This review is based on pertinent articles retrieved by a selective literature search up to 18 August 2014 and on the current interdisciplinary S2k guideline on the diagnostic evaluation and anti-inflammatory treatment of juvenile idiopathic uveitis.
RESULTS: Uveitis arises in roughly 1 in 10 patients with JIA. Regular eye check-ups should be performed starting as soon as JIA is diagnosed. 75-80% of patients are girls; antinuclear antibodies are found in 70-90%. The risk to vision is higher if JIA begins in the preschool years. As for treatment, only a single, small-scale randomized controlled trial (RCT) and a small number of prospective trials have been published to date. Topical corticosteroids should be given as the initial treatment. Systemic immunosuppression is needed if irritation persists despite topical corticosteroids, if new complications arise, or if the topical steroids have to be given in excessively high doses or have unacceptable side effects. If the therapeutic effect remains inadequate, conventional and biological immune modulators can be given as add-on (escalation) therapy. Treatment lowers the risk of uveitis and its complications and thereby improves the prognosis for good visual function.
CONCLUSION: Severely affected patients should be treated in competence centers to optimize their long-term outcome. Multidisciplinary, individualized treatment is needed because of the chronic course of active inflammation and the ensuing high risk of complications that can endanger vision. Future improvements in therapy will be aided by prospective, population-based registries and by basic research on biomarkers for the prediction of disease onset, prognosis, tissue damage, and therapeutic response.",19,2015-Feb-06

To study the efficacy and tolerance of certolizumab pegol (CZP) in active uveitis.
METHODS: Retrospective case series at 4 referral centers. Patients treated with CZP for active uveitis during at least 6 months were eligible. Inflammation by SUN scores, visual acuity (VA) (logMAR), and central macular thickness (CMT) were compared from baseline until final follow-up. Quiescence was defined as 0+ to 0.5+ in anterior chamber and vitreous haze scores and no CMT increase.
RESULTS: Four males and 3 females (14 eyes) were included, mean age 42.4 ± 8.8 years. All were long-lasting chronic-relapsing uveitis with prior failure to other anti-TNF-α. After a mean follow-up of 10.4 ± 4.8 months, 5/7 patients (71.4%) achieved quiescence with CZP. VA improved significantly from +0.52 ± 0.68 to +0.45 ± 0.68 (p = 0.032) at 1 month and to +0.44 ± 0.64 (p = 0.035) at 6 months. No adverse events were found.
CONCLUSION: CZP can be an effective alternative in refractory uveitis.",19,2016-1-1

Corticosteroids (CS) are considered to be the mainstay of therapy in noninfectious uveitis. They can be administered only after excluding an infectious origin or a possible masquerade syndrome. Different CS preparations can be used with various modes of administration: topical, periocular, intraocular, systemic or a combination of the above routes. Their indications depend upon numerous factors, among them the type (involving or not the posterior segment), the severity, the uni-/bilaterality, the chronicity of the intraocular inflammation. The induction treatment must be aggressive in order to overcome the intraocular inflammation as rapidly as possible avoiding permanent tissue damage. The dosage regimen is then tapered according to the clinical response and after a minimum period of quiescence. The maintenance CS treatment should not exceed 6-12 months under the threat of severe adverse effects. In chronic cases, high-dosage CS monotherapy cannot be used; it is important to add an immunomodulatory treatment on time when a long-term therapy is needed to control the disease. Although CS represent the first line of treatment, the type of clinical response to CS is not a reliable indicator of the effectiveness of immunomodulation: a noninfectious uveitis unresponsive to CS may respond to immunomodulation alone or combined with CS.",19,2012-1-1

Several studies suggest a role for IL-6 in the pathogenesis of uveitis. Earlier we have shown that aqueous humour obtained from patients with uveitis contained raised levels of IL-6. In the study described here we investigated the IL-6 levels in vitreous fluid samples obtained from 75 uveitis patients with different uveitis entities. Vitreous samples from 14 patients with proliferative intraocular disorders (PID) and 29 eye bank eyes were used as controls. All the samples were tested in the IL-6 B9 bioassay as well as in a sensitive ELISA for IL-6. Raised IL-6 levels were detected in the vitreous fluid of uveitis patients as well as patients with PID, implicating IL-6 as a common inflammatory mediator. The highest mean level of IL-6 was found in the vitreous fluid of patients with acute retinal necrosis. The mean IL-6 levels measured by the ELISA were higher compared to the levels measured by the B9 bioassay. This may be caused by the presence of B9 bioassay inhibitory factors in the vitreous fluid of these patients.",19,1992-1-1

The incidence and prevalence of juvenile idiopathic arthritis (JIA) vary widely across the world but data in East Asia is lacking. Uveitis is a serious cause of morbidity in JIA. This study aimed to analyze the incidence and prevalence of JIA, and the characteristics of JIA-associated uveitis in Taiwan.
METHODS: A population-based cohort study was conducted using the Taiwan National Health Insurance Research Database. Each patient was individually tracked from 1999 to 2009 to identify the diagnosis of JIA and uveitis using the International Classification of Diseases diagnostic codes. Multivariate logistic regression was used to determine the risk factors and complications of uveitis in patients with JIA.
RESULTS: The study cohort had 2636 cases of JIA and included juvenile rheumatoid arthritis (57.7%), enthesitis-related arthritis (ERA) (39.2%), and psoriatic arthritis (3.1%). The average annual incidence of JIA and JIA-associated uveitis were 4.93 (range, 3.93-6.23) and 0.25 (range, 0.12-0.37) cases per 100,000 population, respectively. The average period prevalence of JIA was 33.8 cases per 100,000 population. Uveitis occurred in 4.7% of patients with JIA, while JIA-associated uveitis was complicated by cataract (11.2%) and glaucoma (24.8%). Enthesitis-related arthritis was significantly associated with uveitis (OR: 3.47; 95% CI: 2.24-5.37) (p<0.0001). Uveitis diagnosed before JIA was the most significant risk factor for complications of glaucoma or cataract (OR: 3.54; 95% CI: 1.44-8.72) (p = 0.006).
CONCLUSIONS: The incidence of JIA is low but that of JIA-associated uveitis is increasing. Higher percentage of males in patients with ERA and the strong association between ERA and uveitis are unique for children with JIA in Taiwan. Uveitis diagnosed before arthritis is an important risk factor for complications. Continuous ophthalmologic follow-up is needed for children with JIA or uveitis of unknown etiology.",19,2013-1-1

To report the outcomes of tocilizumab treatment for refractory ocular inflammatory diseases.
METHODS: A retrospective case series of 17 patients (28 eyes) diagnosed with recalcitrant ocular inflammatory diseases including uveitis (10 cases), scleritis (six cases) and orbital pseudotumour (one case), who received tocilizumab between April 2010 and March 2015. All patients were initiated with treatment of 4 mg/kg or 8 mg/kg tocilizumab. The primary outcome was absence of inflammation and achievement of steroid sparing at 6 and 9 months. Secondary outcomes were change in visual acuity and major adverse effects of tocilizumab causing discontinuation of the treatment.
RESULTS: Mean age at initiation of tocilizumab was 41 ± 16 years. Prior to tocilizumab treatment, all patients underwent unsuccessful conventional immunosuppressive therapy while 94% of patients (16/17) failed treatment with various biological agents. After tocilizumab administration, control of inflammation and steroid sparing were achieved in 63% and 71% of uveitis patients at 6 and 9 months, while 50% of scleritis patients achieved the primary outcome at 6 and 9 months. Mean duration of tocilizumab therapy was 12.6 ± 10.0 (range, 2-35) months. Three of four patients who had a follow-up of at least 18 (range, 18-35) months experienced quiescent inflammation for up to 32 months of tocilizumab use until last visit. Four patients (24%) discontinued tocilizumab due to serious side effects including neutropenia, unacceptable dizziness and nausea, severe angioedema and severe abdominal pain.
CONCLUSION: Our series demonstrated moderate efficacy of tocilizumab in recalcitrant uveitis and scleritis. Serious adverse effects were not uncommon.",19,2016-Sep-1

The utility of an evaluation for systemic disease in a patient with uveitis is controversial. To address this issue, we reviewed the records of 236 consecutive patients with uveitis who were referred primarily by ophthalmologists to an internist in a university-based clinic. Patients were referred for a variety of purposes, including differential diagnosis, treatment recommendations, and desire for a second opinion. The study population included 121 male patients and 115 female patients. In 40% of all patients, a systemic disease thought to be causally related to the eye inflammation was diagnosed or its diagnosis was confirmed. While 53% of patients with anterior uveitis had a causally related systemic illness, only 17% of patients with posterior uveitis and 22% of patients with chorioretinitis had an associated systemic disease. The most frequently diagnosed systemic diseases were Reiter's syndrome, ankylosing spondylitis, Sjögren's syndrome, and sarcoidosis. These diagnoses were usually not known prior to referral. An internist can make a significant contribution to the evaluation of many patients with uveitis. Furthermore, most diagnoses can be established by a thorough history and physical examination, without extensive laboratory testing.",19,1989-May-1

The current study investigates the role of regulatory T (Treg) cells in the pathogenesis of ocular attack in patients with Behcet's disease (BD). Nineteen BD patients with ocular complications (BDo), including 11 BD patients with ocular attack (BDa) and eight BD patients with inactive ocular complications (BDi), were studied. Four BD patients without ocular complications (BDwo) were also evaluated as controls. All patients were prospectively followed by our outpatient clinic between autumn 2004 and spring 2005. CD4+ CD25+bright T cells (Treg cells) from peripheral blood were measured by flow cytometry. The percentages of Treg cells in CD4+ T cells from BDo were significantly decreased before ocular attack compared with those after ocular attack. Moreover, surprisingly, these levels before attack were significantly lower than normal level, whereas the percentages of Treg cells in both BDi and BDwo patients were normal. Treg cells were significantly decreased in BDa before active ocular attack. These findings suggest that Treg cells play an important role in ocular attack in BD patients. In addition, decreased percentages of Treg cells may be a predictive marker of ocular attack in BD patients allowing treatment of BD patients before an ocular attack.",19,2008-1-1

To report three cases of presumed Vogt-Koyanagi-Harada (VKH) disease with unilateral ocular manifestations.
METHODS: This retrospective study reviewed the long-term follow-up observations of three patients who attended the uveitis clinic at Tokyo Medical University Hospital. The patients were followed for 5-16 years with systemic clinical, ophthalmologic and laboratory examinations. Ophthalmoscopic findings, extraocular manifestations, visual acuity, and response to corticosteroid administration were evaluated.
RESULTS: Three patients had characteristic clinical features of VKH involving only one eye, including diffuse choroiditis, serous retinal detachment, focal areas of delayed choroidal perfusion, multifocal areas of pinpoint leakage, macular oedema, and optic nerve staining. All patients received systemic corticosteroid therapy during the acute phase of the disease. During the follow-up period (5-16 years), all three patients developed sunset-glow fundus and nummular chorioretinal depigmented scars in the affected eye only, as well as systemic complications of deafness, vitiligo, and poliosis.
CONCLUSION: The clinical and laboratory features of all three patients were typical of VKH disease except for the unilateral involvement. It is important for ophthalmologists to recognize unilateral VKH disease, even though it is a rare clinical variant of the disease.",19,2009-Aug-1

Caveolin-1 (Cav-1), the signature protein of caveolae, modulates inflammatory responses, and innate immunity. However, Cav-1's role in retinal inflammation has not been rigorously tested. In this study, we examined the effect of Cav-1 ablation on the sensitivity of the retina to inflammation.
METHODS: Cav-1 knockout (KO) mice were challenged by intravitreal injection of lipopolysaccharide (LPS) and inflammatory cell recruitment was assessed by flow cytometry and immunohistochemistry. Leukostasis was assessed in retinal flatmounts after perfusion with FITC-labeled Concanavalin A (FITC-ConA). Chemoattractants were measured by multiplex immunoassays. Blood-retinal barrier (BRB) breakdown was assessed quantitatively by a FITC-dextran permeability assay. The ratio of extravascular to total immune cells was determined by CD45 immunohistochemistry of retinal flatmounts.
RESULTS: Inflammatory challenge resulted in significant blunting of proinflammatory cytokine (monocyte chemoattractant protein-1 [MCP-1/CCL2], CXCL1/KC, IL-6, and IL-1β) responses as well as reduced inflammatory BRB breakdown in Cav-1 KO retinas. Paradoxically, Cav-1 deficiency resulted in significantly increased recruitment of immune cells compared with controls as well as increased leukostasis. A similar ratio of extravascular/total leukocytes were found in Cav-1 KO and wild-type (WT) retinas suggesting that Cav-1 deficient leukocytes were as competent to extravasate as those from WT mice. We found increased levels of circulating immune cells in naïve (not challenged with LPS) Cav-1 KO mice compared with controls.
CONCLUSIONS: Caveolin-1 paradoxically modulates inflammatory signaling and leukocyte infiltration through distinct mechanisms. We hypothesize that Cav-1 expression may enhance inflammatory signaling while at the same time supporting the physical properties of the BRB.",19,2014-Aug-26

The acidic mammalian chitinase (AMCase) is significantly increased in tears of human allergic conjunctivitis. The aim of the study was to investigate the effects of chitinase inhibitors, allosamidin and caffeine versus dexamethasone, in rabbit endotoxin-induced uveitis (EIU). EIU was induced in rabbits by a single intravitreal injection of 100ng/10microl lipopolysaccharide (LPS). Drugs at four different concentrations (0.1, 0.01, 0.001 and 0.0001mM) were topically applied to the rabbit eye five times in 24h. Tears were collected at 0, 6 and 24h after LPS to measure the AMCase activity. The effect of treatment was also evaluated at the same time by slit lamp examination. Tear AMCase activity increased 6 and 24h after LPS injection. The AMCase activity was significantly inhibited in all treated groups with all doses of allosamidin and caffeine except with the lowest concentration. A higher AMCase inhibition at 24h was found with allosamidin and caffeine compared to dexamethasone. Moreover, topical administration of allosamidin, caffeine and dexamethasone produced a remarkable reduction of inflammatory signs, in the order: dexamethasone>caffeine>allosamidin. AMCase inhibitors showed in this rabbit model of uveitis a notable control of inflammatory response with a significant reduction of AMCase activity in tears with caffeine and allosamidin. These results support the key role of AMCase in the pathogenesis of human ocular inflammatory diseases and the therapeutic effect of AMCase inhibitors on experimental uveitis.",19,2008-Mar-1

Recent studies revealing active mechanisms of immune privilege in neural tissues have diminished the putative role of passive tolerance. To examine the significance of Ag localization in the retina on immune privilege, the immune responses of transgenic mice expressing high and low levels of beta-galactosidase (beta-gal) in the photoreceptor cells of the retina were compared with those of normal mice and those of mice expressing moderate levels of beta-gal systemically. Immunization with beta-gal induced experimental autoimmune uveoretinitis indistinguishable from that induced by known photoreceptor cell autoantigens, including destruction of photoreceptor cells, in transgenic mice with high level retinal expression. Retinal expression had no apparent effect on the immune responses to beta-gal, showing that tolerance was not elicited by levels of retinal beta-gal sufficient to serve as a target for autoimmune disease. Mice with systemic expression exhibited reduced lymphoproliferative responses following immunization with beta-gal and did not develop autoimmune disease. T cells prepared from normal mice immunized with beta-gal transferred experimental autoimmune uveoretinitis to the transgenic mice with high level retinal beta-gal expression, but no disease was found in mice with systemic transgene expression under these conditions. The results of our experiments are most consistent with sequestration being the primary mechanism of retinal immune privilege. The results also show that beta-gal can serve as an immunopathogenic neural autoantigen, and that T cells raised by immunization of normal mice with a foreign Ag can be immunopathogenic in certain transgenic recipients.",19,1999-Jul-15

To investigate the incidence and clinical characteristics of Behçet disease in children.
METHODS: The authors retrospectively reviewed the charts of 3382 patients with Behçet disease from October 1986 to December 2005 at Ankara University Medical School Behçet Unit and/or Atmaca private clinic.
RESULTS: 110 children were diagnosed with Behçet disease. The 110 children represented 3.3% of the total number of Behçet patients that were reviewed. 62.7% were girls and 37.3% were boys. The mean age at initial manifestation was 11.63 ± 3.46 years and at diagnosis was 14.15 ± 2.13 years. Ocular involvement was found in 30.9% of the children. Of these, 61.8% were bilateral and 38.2% were unilateral. Anterior uveitis was found in 18 eyes (32.8%), posterior uveitis in 24 eyes (43.6%), and panuveitis in 13 eyes (23.6%).
CONCLUSION: Behçet disease should be considered in the differential diagnosis of childhood uveitis, particularly in endemic areas. The collaboration of pediatricians, rheumatologists, dermatologists, ophthalmologists, and other specialists when necessary is required in the diagnosis and management of children with Behçet disease.",19,2011-Apr-1

Tumor necrosis factor-alpha is known to play an important role in various immune-mediated ocular diseases. Infliximab, a chimeric monoclonal antibody against tumor necrosis factor-alpha, has been used for the treatment of various chronic systemic and ocular inflammatory diseases. The purpose of this study was to evaluate the effect of intravitreal injection of infliximab on the visual acuity and central macular thickness in patients with chronic noninfectious uveitis.
METHODS: Ten eyes of 7 patients with chronic persistent noninfectious uveitis who were nonresponsive to conventional previous medications during the previous 3 months were included in this study. The patients received intravitreal injection of 1.5 mg/0.15 mL infliximab. Mean best-corrected visual acuity and mean central macular thickness 1 day before and 4 weeks after the injection were evaluated and compared.
RESULTS: Mean logarithm of the minimum angle of resolution before and after injection was 1.37 ± 0.43 and 0.67 ± 0.56, respectively, with statistically significant improvement after injection (P = 0.005). The mean central macular thickness before and after injection was 673.20 ± 338.39 μm and 456.40 ± 317.46 μm, respectively, with a significant decrease in the central macular thickness after the injection (P = 0.005).
CONCLUSION: Intravitreal injection of infliximab may improve the visual acuity and decrease the central macular thickness in patients with chronic noninfectious uveitis and significant visual loss and central macular edema.",18,2010-Oct-1

Uveitis-Glaucoma-Hyphaema Syndrome (UGH syndrome, or ""Ellingson"" Syndrome) is a rare condition caused by the mechanical trauma of an intraocular lens malpositioned over adjacent structures (iris, ciliary body, iridocorneal angle), leading to a spectrum of iris transillumination defects, microhyphaemas and pigmentary dispersion, concomitant with elevated intraocular pressure (IOP). UGH Syndrome can also be characterized by chronic inflammation, secondary iris neovascularization, cystoid macular edema (CME). The fundamental step in the pathogenesis of UGH syndrome appears to arise from repetitive mechanical iris trauma by a malpositioned or subluxed IOL. These patients have uncomplicated cataract implants and return for episodes of blurry vision weeks to months after surgery. This may be accompanied by pain, photophobia, erythropsia, anterior uveitis, hyphaema along with raised intraocular pressure. A careful history and examination, as well as appropriate investigations can confirm the diagnostic. Treatment options are IOL Explantation exchange, topical and systemic medication, and cyclophotocoagulation, the placement of a Capsular Tension Ring to redistribute zonular tension and Anti-vascular endothelial growth factor (anti-VEGF) Therapy.",18,2017-1-1

Coccidioidomycosis has been recognized as a common systemic disease since the late 1930's. The occurrence of ocular lesions associated with the systemic infection is uncommon. The anterior segment manifestations appear to be a mild hypersensitivity response; the disease may present as a chronic granulomatous iridocyclitis. In the posterior eye, the manifestations may range from asymptomatic focal chorioretinitis (somewhat similar to the peripheral atrophic lesions of the ocular histoplasmosis syndrome) to a fulminating granulomatous process involving the entire eye. The ocular lesions can occur in the asymptomatic form of systemic coccidioidomycosis. Diagnosis may be confirmed by skin tests and serologic tests. Amphotericin B is usually the drug of choice when treatment is required; however, its adverse effects may be severe, and other drugs, notably Miconazole and Ketoconazole, are being investigated as potential alternatives.",18,1980-1-1

To report the long-term efficacy and safety of the interleukin-6 receptor antagonist tocilizumab for refractory uveitis-related macular edema (ME).
DESIGN: Retrospective cohort study.
PARTICIPANTS: Eyes with uveitis seen at a single tertiary referral center for which ME was the principal cause of reduced visual acuity.
METHODS: Data were obtained by standardized chart review.
MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Central foveal thickness (CFT) measured by optical coherence tomography, degree of anterior and posterior chamber inflammation (Standardization of Uveitis Nomenclature Working Group criteria), and visual acuity (logarithm of the minimum angle of resolution [logMAR]) were recorded during tocilizumab therapy at months 1, 3, 6, and 12.
RESULTS: Eleven eyes from 7 patients (all women) were included. Mean age was 43.4 years. Mean duration of ME was 14.2 years. Mean follow-up with tocilizumab therapy was 15.2 months (range, 12-18 months). Before tocilizumab therapy, conventional immunosuppressive therapy and 1 or more biologic agents failed in all patients. Uveitis diagnoses were birdshot chorioretinopathy (n = 3), juvenile idiopathic arthritis-associated uveitis (n = 3), and idiopathic panuveitis (n = 1). Mean CFT was 550 ± 226 μm at baseline, 389 ± 112 μm at month 1 (P = 0.007), 317 ± 88 μm at month 3 (P = 0.01), 292 ± 79 μm at month 6 (P = 0.006), and 274 ± 56 μm at month 12 of follow-up (P = 0.002). Mean logMAR best-corrected visual acuity improved from 0.67 ± 0.53 at baseline to 0.4 ± 0.56 at month 12 (P = 0.008). Tocilizumab therapy was withdrawn in 2 patients because of sustained remission at month 12. In both patients, ME relapsed 3 months after tocilizumab withdrawal. Reinitiation of tocilizumab therapy led to good uveitis control and ME resolution. Tocilizumab generally was well tolerated and no serious adverse events were reported.
CONCLUSIONS: In this study, tocilizumab was effective in the treatment of refractory inflammatory ME. No serious adverse events were observed.",18,2014-Dec-1

In this study, nanoformulations of methylprednisolone acetate (MPA) were formulated by using a copolymer of poly(ethylacrylate, methyl-methacrylate and chlorotrimethyl-ammonioethyl methacrylate) to study their impacts on the inhibition of inflammatory symptoms in rabbits with endotoxin-induced uveitis (EIU).
METHODS: A modified quasiemulsion solvent diffusion technique was used for the preparation of the nanoparticles. The drug-release profiles and physicochemical characteristics of the nanoformulations were studied by means of X-ray crystallography, differential scanning calorimetry, and Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy. Particle-size analysis yielded mean diameters of approximately 380, 460, and 580 (nm) for copolymer nanoparticles at the ratios of 1:2.5, 1:5, and 1:10, respectively. Major clinical symptoms of EIU (e.g., morphologic changes, leukocytes numbers, and protein levels within the aqueous humor) were examined.
RESULTS: Upon the physicochemical characterizations, no crystal changes or chemical interactions were observed for the copolymer nanoparticles. The 1:2.5 ratio of drug polymer resulted in the most controlled release of MPA. The in vivo examinations revealed that the endotoxin-induced inflammation can be inhibited by the copolymer nanosuspension more significantly than by the microsuspension of MPA itself in the rabbits with EIU.
CONCLUSIONS: Based on our findings, we suggest that the copolymer nanosuspension may favor the localized, controlled ocular delivery of MPA for the prevention of inflammatory symptoms in ocular diseases.",18,2007-Oct-1

We previously reported that after exposure to inflammatory cytokines, such as IL-17 and IFN-γ, RPE cells express increased amounts of suppressor of cytokine signaling, leading to general suppression of the inflammatory response. Here, we demonstrate that RPE cells expressed increased levels of PD-L1 in response to IL-17, IFN-γ, or Poly I:C. These PD-L1(hi) RPE cells inhibited the pathogenic activities of IRBP-specific T cells, which usually induced uveitis when injected into naïve mice (EAU). The suppressed pathogenicity of these uveitogenic T cells after exposure to PD-L1(hi) RPE cells could be partially reversed by anti-PD-L1 antibodies. Nevertheless, IRBP-specific T cells pre-exposed to PD-L1(hi) RPE cells displayed substantial suppressor activity, which strongly inhibited the activation of fresh IRBP-Teffs in response to subsequent antigenic challenge and when transferred into naïve mice, inhibited the induction of EAU by IRBP-Teff transfer. These findings suggest that inflammatory cytokine-triggered up-regulation of PD-L1 on RPE constitutes a critical factor for inducing infiltrated uveitogenic T cells with regulatory activities, which may accelerate the natural resolution of T cell-mediated intraocular inflammation.",18,2010-Dec-1

To describe ocular syphilis presentations to a tertiary referral eye hospital over a 5-year period and to document HIV coinfection frequency.
METHODS: A retrospective chart review was conducted of consecutive ocular syphilis presentations to Sydney Eye Hospital from 2007 to 2012. Inclusion criteria were positive syphilis serology, ocular inflammation on clinical examination and appropriate syphilis treatment. Outcome measures were clinical features at presentation and best-corrected visual acuity (BCVA) at interval follow-up.
RESULTS: Thirty-seven eyes of 25 patients were included in the series. Patients were predominantly male (92.0%, p<0.05) with mean age 43.7±14.0 years. Eight (32.0%) patients had confirmed HIV coinfection, three newly diagnosed with HIV. Twelve (32.4%) eyes demonstrated anterior segment involvement with anterior uveitis. Twenty-five (67.6%) eyes demonstrated posterior segment involvement, including panuveitis, acute syphilitic posterior placoid chorioretinitis, retinitis, necrotising retinitis, punctate retinitis and optic neuritis. There was a significant improvement in BCVA for involved eyes (p<0.05) at 1 month and 2-3 months follow-up.
CONCLUSIONS: The clinical findings of 37 eyes with ocular syphilis demonstrated a broad spectrum of clinical manifestations. Rates of HIV coinfection were high, with patients exhibiting both anterior and posterior segment inflammation. Visual outcome improved following syphilis treatment.",18,2015-Sep-1

To assess the visual acuity outcome after treatment, in patients with differing types of uveitis associated with sarcoidosis, and to determine the types of sight-threatening complications.
METHODS: This was an retrospective, non-comparative, interventional study of patients who had uveitis with a confirmed diagnosis of sarcoidosis and a minimum follow-up duration of 6 months from presentation. The worst affected eye at presentation was selected for the study. Complications causing impaired vision were documented, changes in visual acuity after completion of treatment were measured, and the risk of 'poor outcome' (visual acuity 6/12 and less) was compared in the various types of uveitis, using 'exact' multiple logistic regression to control confounding by other prognostic factors.
RESULTS: Seventy-five patients were studied. The spectrum of ocular inflammation in sarcoidosis is wide. Presentation may be acute and non-granulomatous or chronic and granulomatous with posterior segment involvement being varied. Poor visual outcome was significantly more frequent in multifocal choroiditis (5/7, 71.4%), and in panuveitis without multifocal choroiditis (13/28, 46.4%), compared to only 3/24 (12.5%) patients with anterior uveitis. The excess risks remained significant after adjustment for confounding effects of other prognostic factors including age, sex and manifest systemic sarcoidosis. Causes of visual loss were cataract, glaucoma, macular oedema, vitreous haemorrhage and retinal detachment.
CONCLUSION: Multifocal choroiditis is a less common manifestation of uveitis associated with sarcoidosis but appears to be associated with a worse visual prognosis despite immunosuppressive therapy.",18,2003-Aug-1

To examine the clinical manifestations of syphilitic uveitis in a population and review trends in incidence at a tertiary referral centre.
METHODS: A retrospective, non-comparative interventional case series of 22 consecutive patients with syphilitic uveitis who were managed in the Ocular Inflammation and Immunology Services of the Singapore National Eye Centre between 1995 and 2006.
RESULTS: Twenty-two patients (mean age 52.7 years, range 18-78) with a positive serum fluorescent treponemal antibody absorption test (100%) and negative HIV serology were reviewed. Non-granulomatous anterior uveitis was the commonest presenting finding (18/29 eyes, 62.06%). Posterior uveitis was seen in four (13.7%), intermediate uveitis in three (10.3%) and panuveitis was seen in eight (27.5%) eyes at presentation. Vitritis (19 eyes, 65.4%) was the commonest posterior segment finding. The majority (86.4%) had latent syphilis at the time of ocular involvement. An increasing trend in the number of cases of ocular syphilis in the past decade was not observed.
CONCLUSIONS: Despite resurgence in infectious syphilis, this centre did not see a dramatic rise in cases of syphilitic uveitis. Ocular syphilis presented most frequently as a non-granulomatous inflammation. Therefore, syphilis serology should be sought even for cases of anterior uveitis.",18,2008-May-1

To describe recent evidence from the literature concerning optimal treatment of cataract in patients with concomitant uveitis.
RECENT FINDINGS: Optimal treatment of cataract in the setting of uveitis requires optimal management of uveitis, including appropriate diagnostic workup and scrupulous attention to preoperative preparation, intraoperative technique, and postoperative management. Recent literature suggests high rates of recurrence of certain forms of uveitis (such as ocular toxoplasmosis) after surgery, suggesting that perioperative prophylaxis may be warranted. Placement of intraocular lenses in the setting of certain forms of uveitis, such as juvenile idiopathic arthritis-associated uveitis, remains controversial. Although excellent outcomes can be achieved with many types of intraocular lenses, several recent studies have suggested that the incidence of postoperative complications may be lower in patients receiving acrylic intraocular lenses compared with other materials. Recent long-term outcome studies in cohorts of uveitis patients undergoing cataract surgery suggest very good outcomes in the majority of patients.
SUMMARY: Provided the unique challenges of cataract surgery in the setting of uveitis are recognized and appropriately addressed, excellent visual outcomes can be achieved in most patients.",18,2009-Jan-1

Endotoxin induced uveitis in the mouse provides a useful animal model for acute anterior uveitis in humans. We have investigated the susceptibility of endotoxin-induced uveitis among various mouse strains, and have examined the relationship between genetic background and the resultant inflammatory response to endotoxin. We studied ten strains with differing major histocompatibility-2 genes, lipopolysaccharide response gene, and strains with mast cell depletion and its sham control. Anterior uveitis was induced by injecting 300 micrograms of Salmonella typhimurium endotoxin into one hind footpad. Mice were then killed 8, 12, 16, 20, 24, 48 and 72 hr after endotoxin injection, and vertical sections of the eyes through the pupil-optic nerve axis were evaluated for ocular inflammation. C3H/HeN mice developed severe uveitis. In contrast, C3H/HeJ mice (lipopolysaccharide response gene-) did not develop uveitis even though it has the same genetic background and shares the same major histocompatibility-2 haplotype with C3H/HeN mice (lipopolysaccharide response gene+). The strain that was mast-cell deficient (W/Wv) developed minimal uveitis; however, W/+ mice, with mast cells, developed more inflammation at 48 and 72 hr after endotoxin injection. C3H.SW and FVB/N mice also developed severe uveitis, and BALB/C, CBA/J, and B10.A developed mild uveitis. In conclusion, there is a wide variation in the magnitude and susceptibility to endotoxin among mouse strains. Multiple factors appear to influence this variability, including non-histocompatibility-2 genetic background, the lipopolysaccharide response gene, and the presence of mast cells.",18,1995-Nov-1

To compare clinical features of uveitis in patients affected by psoriasis and psoriatic arthritis (PsA).
METHODS: A retrospective case-control study.
RESULTS: 117 patients were affected by uveitis and psoriasis or PsA (92 and 25 patients, respectively) from 2003 to 2013. Axial PsA was associated with unilateral uveitis onset compared to the peripheral pattern (p < 0.03). The prevalence of eyes with at least one complication involving anterior segment was significantly more represented in the PsA group than the psoriasis one (p = 0.024). Anterior segment complications were more frequently associated with posterior ones in PsA patients than in psoriasis patients (p = 0.005). Most common complications in total sample at baseline examination were cataract (29.7%), ocular hypertension (17%), macular edema (7%), and pupillary seclusion (4.4%).
CONCLUSION: Uveitis in patients with psoriasis and PsA may have distinguishing clinical features. PsA patients have more ocular complications than those with psoriasis. Both groups need an ophthalmological examination to promptly detect ocular co-morbidity.",18,2017-1-1

The current issues in the management of uveitis associated with juvenile arthritis revolve mainly around the treatment of mild disease and how to treat patients with more severe disease. The aims of this study were to determine the incidence of uveitis in a cohort of patients with juvenile arthritis as well as the nature of treatment and the risk factors for visual loss.
METHODS: Review of the charts of 71 patients with juvenile arthritis, as defined by the American Academy of Rheumatology, seen between 1992 and 2001 at a combined rheumatology and ophthalmology clinic. Information collected included the patient's sex, age at diagnosis of arthritis and uveitis, and date of diagnosis of arthritis and uveitis. The rheumatologic diagnosis, results of serologic testing, and details of systemic and topical treatments were also recorded.
RESULTS: There were 47 girls and 24 boys ranging in age from 16 months to 13 years. The median age at diagnosis of juvenile arthritis was 4 years and 1 month. Twenty-seven patients (38%) had uveitis. The median age at uveitis onset was 5.9 years, with an average interval of 18 months from the diagnosis of arthritis; 11 patients had uveitis at the time of arthritis diagnosis. There was a positive relation between anti-nuclear antibody positivity and the development of uveitis (p < 0.05). Thirteen (48%) of the 27 patients with uveitis had mild anterior segment inflammation, with fewer than 25 cells in the anterior chamber. This group had spontaneous resolution of uveitis without topical therapy. All the patients without uveitis had a final visual acuity of 6/9 or better. Five of the patients with uveitis had a final visual acuity of 6/36 or worse. Cataract was the most common complication affecting visual outcome. Cataract extraction initially improved the visual acuity, but posterior segment complications and glaucoma compromised the final visual outcome.
INTERPRETATION: We found an incidence of uveitis of 38% with long-term follow-up of patients with juvenile arthritis; the uveitis was diagnosed an average of 18 months after the arthritis. Almost half of the patients with uveitis had minor anterior segment inflammation. These patients did not receive topical treatment and had good visual outcomes. Patients with uveitis at the time of diagnosis of arthritis tended to have a worse visual prognosis and experienced persistent uveitis despite treatment. In this series, cataract extraction was beneficial in improving visual acuity immediately postoperatively, but posterior segment changes and glaucoma may compromise final visual outcomes.",18,2004-Oct-1

To compare clinical characteristics and outcomes in patients with uveitis caused by herpes simplex virus (HSV) and varicella zoster virus (VZV).
DESIGN: Retrospective comparative study.
PARTICIPANTS: Forty patients with HSV uveitis and 24 patients with VZV uveitis.
METHODS: A retrospective study of 40 patients with HSV and 24 patients with VZV uveitis was performed. The patients were followed between May 1987 and September 1999 (median follow-up time, 46 months). The diagnosis of HSV uveitis was made clinically and serologically, and the diagnosis of VZV uveitis was made clinically.
MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Clinical presentation of the disease, ocular complications, visual acuity, surgical and medical treatments needed.
RESULTS: Both populations were comparable for gender and age at disease onset. The course of the disease tended to be remitting and recurrent in HSV patients and chronic in VZV patients (P = 0.046). The most frequent ocular complication in both groups was secondary glaucoma (54% HSV, 38% VZV). Twenty-five percent of VZV patients developed posterior pole complications (cystoid macular edema, epiretinal membrane, papillitis, retinal fibrosis, and detachment) compared with 8% of HSV patients (P = 0.069). Treatment modalities selected were generally similar in the two groups, although periocular and systemic steroids were required more frequently in HSV patients (60% versus 25%; P = 0.01). Surgical procedures were required with similar frequency in both populations. The percentage of eyes that were legally blind at end of follow-up was also comparable (HSV, 20%; VZV, 21%). The visual outcome was similar in the studied populations.
CONCLUSIONS: This study represents the only direct comparison of HSV and VZV uveitis patients reported in the literature. HSV patients were more likely to be treated with periocular and systemic steroids, and VZV patients were more likely to develop posterior pole complications (a finding of borderline significance). Other parameters evaluated in this study were not statistically different in the two patient groups.",18,2002-Aug-1

To report the effectiveness of repeated intravitreal dexamethasone (DEX) inserts in noninfectious uveitis patients.
DESIGN: Prospective, single-center, interventional clinical trial between February 2010 and March 2015.
PARTICIPANTS: Patients with noninfectious uveitis with cystoid macular edema and/or vitreitis.
METHODS: Patients were treated with a 700-μg intravitreal DEX insert (Ozurdex; Allergan, Inc., Irvine, CA). Follow-up visits were scheduled 1, 3, and 6 months after injection. Best-corrected visual acuity (BCVA), central retinal thickness (CRT), vitreous haze (VH) score, intraocular pressure (IOP), and adverse events were recorded.
MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Primary outcome was the reduction of CRT. Secondary outcome was the improvement in BCVA and reduction of VH.
RESULTS: In total, 109 eyes of 76 patients received 298 DEX inserts. Fifty-two patients were women (68%). The mean age of all participants was 57 years (range, 24-88 years). More than 3 DEX inserts were injected into 44% of eyes. Mean number of injections were 1.54±0.5 (standard deviation [SD]), 1.98±0.84, and 2.46±1.1 over 12, 18, and 24 months, respectively. Central retinal thickness decreased significantly (P < 0.001) from 465 μm at baseline to 318, 342, and 388 μm after 1, 3, and 6 months, respectively. Similar trends were seen in eyes receiving a second, third, and fourth DEX insert. Patients with idiopathic uveitis and sarcoidosis benefited well from DEX inserts. The greatest overall benefit was achieved in patients with no systemic treatment and patients receiving antimetabolites and cyclosporin A. A significant VH score reduction was documented in 44% of eyes after 1 month. A gain of more than 3 lines in BCVA was recorded in 31% to 37%, 26% to 39%, and 8% to 32% of eyes after 1, 3, and 6 months, respectively. A transient rise in mean IOP after 1 month (P < 0.001) and after 3 months (P = 0.001) was seen.
CONCLUSIONS: The repeated longer-term administration of DEX inserts in noninfectious uveitis patients, either alone or in combination with other therapies, led to improved CRT, BCVA, and VH. Underlying diseases and concomitant systemic therapy seem to have an impact on overall treatment benefit. Ocular complications were reversible and were managed by local treatment, with exception of cataract formation.",18,2018-Jul-1

To test the hypothesis that autoimmune mechanisms are involved in horses in which equine recurrent uveitis (ERU) develops spontaneously.
METHODS: Material obtained from horses treated for spontaneous disease by therapeutic routine vitrectomy was analyzed for total IgG content and IgG specific for S-Antigen (S-Ag) and interphotoreceptor retinoid-binding protein (IRBP). The cellular infiltrate of the vitreous was analyzed by differential counts of cytospin preparations and flow cytometry using equine lymphocyte-specific antibodies. Antigen-specific proliferation assays were performed comparing peripheral blood lymphocytes (PBLs) with vitreal lymphocytes by stimulation with S-Ag and several S-Ag- and IRBP-derived peptides.
RESULTS: The total IgG content of specimens from horses with ERU was very high with great variability among the investigated samples (11.5 +/- 8.0 mg). Autoantibodies to S-Ag or IRBP or both were found in 72% of vitreous specimens from horses with uveitis. The leukocyte infiltrates (up to 2 x 10(8) cells per sample) were dominated by lymphocytes (>90%) in most cases (22/32). Flow cytometry showed that more than 50% of these cells were CD4(+) T cells. In vitro stimulation of vitreal lymphocytes, but not of PBL, showed a strong proliferative response to peptides derived from S-Ag or IRBP in 9 of 12 patients.
CONCLUSIONS: In the eyes of horses with ERU, IgG antibodies and autoreactive T cells specific for retinal antigens were detected. These results strongly support the hypothesis that ERU is an autoimmune-mediated disease and is highly similar to recurrent uveitis in humans in both clinical and immunologic parameters.",18,2001-Feb-1

Macular edema (ME) represents the most common cause for visual loss among uveitis patients. The management of uveitic macular edema (UME) may be challenging, due to its often recalcitrant nature. Corticosteroids remain the mainstay of treatment, through their capability of effectively controlling inflammation and the associated ME. Topical steroids may be effective in milder cases of UME, particularly in edema associated with anterior uveitis. Posterior sub-Tenon and orbital floor steroids, as well as intravitreal steroids often induce rapid regression of UME, although this may be followed by recurrence of the pathology. Intra-vitreal corticosteroid implants provide sustained release of steroids facilitating regression of ME with less frequent injections. Topical nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs may provide a safe alternative or adjuvant therapy to topical steroids in mild UME, predominantly in cases with underlying anterior uveitis. Immunomodulators including methotrexate, mycophenolate mofetil, tacrolimus, azathioprine, and cyclosporine, as well as biologic agents, notably the anti-tumor necrosis factor-α monoclonal antibodies adalimumab and infliximab, may accomplish the control of inflammation and associated ME in refractory cases, or enable the tapering of steroids. Newer biotherapies have demonstrated promising outcomes and may be considered in persisting cases of UME.",18,2019-1-1

Psoriasis is a systemic, chronic, immunologically mediated disease, with significant genetic and environmental influences. It affects from 1 to 3% of the world population. Recently, the relation between psoriasis and different comorbidities, particularly metabolic syndrome, has become extremely relevant. Uveitis is characterized by a process of intraocular inflammation resulting from various causes. Considering psoriasis and uveitis as immune-mediated diseases, this study aims to evaluate the possible association of psoriasis and/or psoriatic arthritis with uveitis and its subtypes. Few studies have evaluated the association of uveitis and psoriasis without joint involvement. It seems that psoriasis without arthropathy is not a risk factor for the development of uveitis. Uveitis tends to develop more frequently in patients with arthropathy or pustular psoriasis than in patients with other forms of psoriasis. Ophthalmic examination should be performed periodically in patients with psoriasis and uveitis. If ophthalmopathy is diagnosed, the patient should receive adequate treatment with anti-inflammatory drugs or immunomodulators to prevent vision loss.",18,2012-1-1

Uveitis is a major cause of ocular morbidity in developed countries. It has been demonstrated that macular edema is a significant cause of decreased visual acuity and macular edema in these patients. In this article, we evaluate the long-term outcome of intravitreal bevacizumab in the treatment of refractory uveitic macular edema.
METHODS: In this retrospective, noncomparative, interventional case series, uveitic patients with macular edema who were refractory to conventional therapy and who were treated with intravitreal bevacizumab were identified and assessed. Best-corrected visual acuity and optical coherence tomography central macular thickness measurements were collected and analyzed with correlative statistical analysis, including the use of Student paired t-test, Kaplan-Meier, and linear regression analysis.
RESULTS: Twenty-nine eyes of 27 patients with diverse uveitic etiologies were analyzed and followed up at 1 year. Thirteen patients received a single intravitreal bevacizumab injection. Six patients required a second intravitreal bevacizumab injection, while 10 patients received combination therapy of intravitreal bevacizumab and triamcinolone acetonide. Baseline mean logMAR visual acuity was -0.59. At 1 year, the mean logMAR visual acuity was -0.42-/+ 0.36 (p=0.0045). Baseline mean central macular thickness was 383.66 microm. At 1 year, the mean thickness was 294.32-/+110.87 (p=0.0007).
CONCLUSIONS: Intravitreal bevacizumab is a useful and therapeutically beneficial agent in the treatment of refractory uveitic macular edema. Some patients will require adjunctive intravitreal bevacizumab injections or the use of combination therapy with intravitreal triamcinolone acetonide.",18,2009-1-1

Tubulointerstitial nephritis and uveitis syndrome (TINU) is a specific form of intraocular inflammation (uveitis) combined with kidney disease that was first described in two patients by Dobrin et al. in 1975. Since then, approximately 200 more cases have been published. The cause of the disease is still unknown. A hypersensitivity reaction is suspected, especially an infection or very rarely a medication reaction is thought to trigger the disease. It is considered to be a rare disease and thus unfortunately is still unfamiliar to most ophthalmologists. Therefore, it is frequently overlooked in the differential diagnosis. In this review we want to show advances in diagnostics and treatment as well as progress in deciphering the pathogenesis.
RECENT FINDINGS: Beta-2 microglobulin (Ub2MG) analysis in urine and human leukocyte antigen (HLA) typing is helpful to diagnose TINU cases. A high association of HLA-DRB1*01 has been shown with TINU. A first single case report suggests a common antibody production against ocular and renal proteins.
SUMMARY: TINU is a common cause of uveitis among patients who present with bilateral, anterior uveitis of sudden onset. It is more frequent in children and apparently in boys. Although the activity of the eye disease can persist for many months, it is usually controlled with little treatment and the outcome is very good.",18,2009-Nov-1

Inflammation of renal interstitium and uveal tissue establishes the two components of tubulointerstitial nephritis and uveitis (TINU) syndrome. Although believed to occur more frequently in young females, a broad spectrum of patients can be affected. Both renal and eye disease can be asymptomatic and may not manifest simultaneously, having independent progressions. Renal disease manifests as acute kidney injury and may cause permanent renal impairment. Eye inflammation can manifest in different anatomical forms, most commonly as bilateral anterior uveitis and may progress to a chronic course. TINU syndrome accounts for approximately 1%-2% of uveitis in tertiary referral centres. A literature review covering the clinical features, pathogenesis, diagnosis and treatment is presented.",18,2020-Jun-1

Tubulointerstitial nephritis and uveitis (TINU) is an important yet underrecognized ocular inflammatory syndrome. This review summarizes key historical publications that identified and defined the syndrome, and more recent literature that reveal the importance of urinary β2-microglobulin testing and kidney biopsy in the diagnostic evaluation of patients with TINU. Additionally, research studies providing new insights into disease pathogenesis are highlighted.
RECENT FINDINGS: In contrast with initial reports of TINU manifesting exclusively as an anterior uveitis in pediatric patients, more recent reports have identified TINU in patients of all ages with a wide range of ocular manifestations. Urinary β2-microglobulin has emerged as a sensitive and specific laboratory screening test, and the role of kidney biopsy in differentiating TINU from sarcoidosis continues to evolve. Genetic studies have identified HLA-DQA101, HLA-DQB105, and HLA-DRB101 as high-risk alleles and the identification of antimonomeric C-reactive protein antibodies suggests a role for humoral immunity in disease pathogenesis. Management strategies have evolved to include systemic anti-inflammatory treatment as a result of important outcome studies in patients with significant renal and ocular disease.
SUMMARY: With greater recognition, understanding, and treatment of this syndrome, both ocular inflammation and renal disease can be better addressed.",18,2017-Nov-1

Any patient with a diagnosis of central serous chorioretinopathy (CSCR) should be questioned to determine any recent corticosteroid use, as the poor visual outcome may be due to unrecognized corticosteroid use. Atypical forms of CSCR may be misdiagnosed as an inflammatory serous retinal detachment, mainly Vogt-Koyanagi-Harada disease. CSCR that develops in association with preexisting uveitis could be a challenging diagnosis as it might be misinterpreted as a worsening of the primary inflammatory condition. Failure to differentiate CSCR from retinal or choroidal inflammatory diseases may result in inappropriate use of corticosteroids, leading to exacerbation of the condition and permanent visual loss. Discontinuation of corticosteroids should be the first step in the treatment of CSCR associated with corticosteroid therapy, and the use of immunosuppressive or immunomodulatory drugs may be required to control systemic or ocular inflammatory disease. The prognosis is usually favorable, but persistent visual loss may occur.",18,2012-Apr-1

The clinical features and ophthalmologic findings of 20 patients with syphilitic posterior uveitis seen at the Detroit Medical Center from November 1993 through February 1996 were reviewed. The mean age was 58 years; 8 patients were male and 12 were female; and all patients were black. Three of 9 patients tested were HIV positive. Patients were divided into 2 groups: those with acute (8) and those with chronic (12) syphilitic posterior uveitis. Chorioretinitis was the predominant uveitic pattern (15/20). Eighteen patients presented with blurred vision. All patients had reactive serum fluorescent treponemal antibody, absorbed (FTA-ABS); 3 had nonreactive rapid plasma reagin (RPR). Mean RPR titer in the chronic uveitis group and in the acute uveitis group was 1:27.3 and 1:209.8, respectively. Seven patients had abnormal cerebrospinal fluid (CSF); CSF VDRL was reactive in 2 patients. All patients were treated with intravenous penicillin G. Eight of 14 patients seen at follow-up showed improvement of ophthalmologic findings. Syphilis should be considered in the differential diagnosis of posterior uveitis.",18,2000-Mar-1

To analyze the effectiveness of immunosuppressants and biological therapies in autoimmune posterior uveitis, chronic anterior uveitis associated with juvenile idiopathic arthritis, and macular edema.
METHODS: Systematic review. We conducted a sensitive literature search in Medline (from 1961) and EMBASE (from 1980) until October 2007. Selection criteria were as follows: (1) population: autoimmune posterior uveitis, chronic anterior uveitis in juvenile idiopathic arthritis, and macular edema; (2) intervention: immunosuppressive and biologic therapies; (3) outcomes: visual acuity, Tyndall, vitreous haze, macular edema, pars planitis, and retinal vasculitis. There were no limitations regarding study design. The quality of each study was evaluated using the Jadad's scale and Oxford Levels of Evidence.
RESULTS: Two hundred sixty-five articles were selected for detailed review of the 4235 found in the initial search: 128 records were on immunosuppressants, 105 on biological therapies, and 32 on macular edema. Overall, both the immunosuppressive and the biologic therapies appeared effective in the treatment of autoimmune posterior uveitis, except for daclizumab in uveitis related to Behçet's disease, and for etanercept in any uveitis. In the treatment of macular edema, the drugs tested were also effective.
CONCLUSIONS: Based on the evidence collated, immunosuppressants and biological therapies (except for daclizumab in Behçet and etanercept) may be effective in autoimmune uveitis and macular edema. No superiority may be inferred from this review.",18,2011-Feb-1

Uveitis can be a serious complication of leptospirosis. Previous studies indicated that the leptospiral lipoproteins LruA and LruB are expressed in the eyes of uveitic horses and that antibodies directed against those proteins show in vitro cross-reactivity with components of equine lens, ciliary body, and/or retina. We now demonstrate that sera from a significant proportion of humans who have leptospiral uveitis also contain antibodies against LruA and LruB. Different categories of nonleptospiral uveitis and autoimmune uveitis were also screened; patients diagnosed with Fuchs uveitis or Behçet's syndrome produced antibodies that cross-reacted with LruA and LruB, suggesting similarities of the autoimmune responses in those diseases with those of leptospiral uveitis.",18,2008-Jun-1

Globally, 145.2 million people suffer from moderate to severe vision impairment or blindness due to preventable or treatable causes. However, patient adherence to topical or intravitreal treatment is a leading cause of poor outcomes. To address this issue, we designed an intraocularly implantable device called the nanofluidic Vitreal System for Therapeutic Administration (nViSTA) for continuous and controlled drug release based on a nanochannel membrane that obviates the need for pumps or actuation. In vitro release analysis demonstrated that our device achieves sustained release of bimatoprost (BIM) and dexamethasone (DEX) at concentrations within clinically relevant therapeutic window. In this proof of concept study, we constructed an anatomically similar in silico human eye model to simulate DEX release from our implant and gain insight into intraocular pharmacokinetics profile. Overall, our drug-agnostic intraocular implant represents a potentially viable platform for long-term treatment of various chronic ophthalmologic diseases, including diabetic macular edema and uveitis.",18,2019-Feb-1

Adalimumab (ADA) has been shown to be an effective treatment for Behçet's disease (BD)-related uveitis. We aimed at evaluating the cumulative retention rate of ADA during a 48-month follow-up period in patients with BD-related uveitis, the impact of a concomitant use of disease modifying anti-rheumatic drugs (DMARDs) on ADA retention rate, and differences according to the various lines of biologic therapy (ie, first- vs second-line or more). Predictive factors of response to ADA were also investigated.
METHODS: We enrolled patients diagnosed with BD-related uveitis and treated with ADA between January 2009 and December 2016. Cumulative survival rates were studied using the Kaplan-Meier plot, while the log-rank (Mantel-Cox) test was used to compare survival curves. Statistical analysis was performed to identify differences according to the response to ADA.
RESULTS: 54 consecutive patients (82 eyes) were eligible for analysis. The drug retention rate at 12- and 48-month follow-up was 76.9% and 63.5%, respectively. No statistically significant differences were identified according to the use of concomitant DMARDs (p=0.27) and to the different lines of ADA treatment (p=0.37). No significant differences were found between patients continuing and discontinuing ADA in terms of age (p=0.24), age at BD onset (p=0.81), age at uveitis onset (p=0.56), overall BD duration (p=0.055), uveitis duration (p=0.46), human leucocyte antigen-B51 positivity (p=0.51), and gender (p=0.47).
CONCLUSIONS: ADA retention rate in BD-related uveitis is excellent and is not affected by the concomitant use of DMARDs or by the different lines of biological therapy. Negative prognostic factors for BD uveitis do not impact ADA efficacy.",18,2018-May-1

To assess health-related quality of life with Italian SF-36 in patients with uveitis on chronic systemic immunosuppressants.
METHODS: Consecutive patients with chronic noninfectious uveitis on systemic immunosuppressive treatment seen at the Ocular Immunology Service, San Raffaele Scientific Institute, Milan, were enrolled. Health status was evaluated with the Italian version of the SF-36 questionnaire in 8 dimensions: physical functioning, physical disability, body pain, general health, vitality, social functioning, emotional disability, mental health. Statistical analysis of variance was used to test for differences in SF-36 scores between subgroups of interest (age, sex, educational level, location and laterality of uveitis, systemic associated diseases, visual acuity, systemic treatment, duration of disease).
RESULTS: One hundred Caucasian patients (35 female, 65 male) with a median age of 46.31 years (range 10-76) were examined. Uveitis was bilateral in 88% of patients. Uveitis location was anterior (12%), intermediate (10%), posterior (34%), and panuveitis (44%). The most frequent diagnoses were idiopathic (32%), sarcoidosis (15%), and Behçet disease (15%). The SF-36 physical and mental component summary scores were lower among uveitis patients than those of the general Italian population; the most statistically significant differences found in subgroups were older age, female sex, low visual acuity (<20/40), and long-standing duration of the disease (>6 years).
CONCLUSIONS: Italian patients with uveitis on chronic systemic immunosuppressants reported markedly poorer general health status than normal matched population subjects. The quality of life of these patients seems to be significantly related to visual acuity and disease duration.",18,2010-Aug-1

Autoantigen-specific regulatory immunity emerges in the spleen of mice recovering from experimental autoimmune uveitis (EAU), a murine model for human autoimmune uveoretinitis. This regulatory immunity provides induced tolerance to ocular autoantigen, and requires melanocortin 5 receptor (MC5r) expression on antigen presenting cells with adenosine 2 A receptor (A2Ar) expression on T cells. During EAU it is not well understood what roles MC5r and A2Ar have on promoting regulatory immunity. Cytokine profile analysis during EAU revealed MC5r and A2Ar each mediate distinct T cell responses, and are responsible for a functional regulatory immune response in the spleen. A2Ar stimulation at EAU onset did not augment this regulatory response, nor bypass the MC5r requirement to induce regulatory immunity. The importance of this pathway in human autoimmune uveitis was assayed. PBMC from uveitis patients were assayed for MC5r expression on monocytes and A2Ar on T cells, and comparison between uveitis patients and healthy controls had no significant difference. The importance for MC5r and A2Ar expression in EAU to promote the induction of protective regulatory immunity, and the expression of MC5r and A2Ar on human immune cells, suggests that it may be possible to utilize the melanocortin-adenosinergic pathways to induce protective immunity in uveitic patients.",18,2016-Nov-25

The need remains great for early diagnosis of diseases. The special structure of the eye provides a unique opportunity for noninvasive light-based imaging of fundus vasculature. To detect endothelial injury at the early and reversible stage of adhesion molecule up-regulation, we generated novel imaging agents that target two distinct types of endothelial molecules, a mediator of rolling, P-selectin, and one that mediates firm adhesion, ICAM-1. Interactions of these double-conjugated fluorescent microspheres (MSs) in retinal or choroidal microvasculature were visualized in live animals by scanning laser ophthalmoscopy. The new imaging agents showed significantly higher sensitivity for detection of endothelial injury than singly conjugated MSs (rPSGL-1- or alpha-ICAM-1-conjugated), both in terms of rolling (P<0.01) and firm adhesion (P<0.01). The rolling flux of alpha-ICAM-1-conjugated MSs did not differ in EIU animals, whereas double-conjugated MSs showed significantly higher rolling flux (P<0.01), revealing that ICAM-1 in vivo supports rolling, once MS interaction with the endothelium is initiated. Double-conjugated MSs specifically detected firmly adhering leukocytes (P<0.01), allowing in vivo quantification of immune response. Antiinflammatory treatment with dexamethasone led to reduced leukocyte accumulation (P<0.01) as well as MS interaction (P<0.01), which suggests that treatment success and resolution of inflammation is quantitatively reflected with this molecular imaging approach. This work introduces novel imaging agents for noninvasive detection of endothelial injury in vivo. Our approach may be developed further to diagnose human disease at a much earlier stage than currently possible.",18,2010-May-1

A single intraperitoneal dose of endotoxin (lipopolysaccharide or LPS) induces an acute inflammatory response in the uveal tract of rats. This inflammation is characterized by a breakdown of the blood/aqueous barrier within 3 hr after the LPS and the subsequent development of clinical disease and a cellular infiltrate. Early change in vascular permeability, clinical, and pathological changes were dose dependent with the two highest doses (100 micrograms or 500 micrograms) producing more severe pathology. Clinical and histopathologic abnormalities peaked at 24 hr and were resolving by 48 hr. Although clinical and histologic changes correlated well, the degree of breakdown of the blood/aqueous barrier at 3 hr failed to predict the extent of the cellular exudate measured by either clinical or histologic criteria. In addition, pharmacologic suppression of the early vascular permeability changes with indomethacin, cyproheptadine, or both agents failed to protect the animals consistently from subsequently developing significant clinical disease or cellular infiltrates on histopathology. LPS-induced uveitis in the rat provides a simple, reproducible model for ocular inflammation without requiring direct eye manipulation. The mediators responsible for the early vascular permeability in this model appear to be distinct from the mediators primarily responsible for the subsequent cellular exudate.",18,1984-Nov-1

To compare vision-related functioning and health-related quality of life of patients with noninfectious intermediate or posterior uveitis with those of the US general population and normal-vision reference groups.
METHODS: Secondary analysis of health-related quality of life measures administered at baseline to patients with noninfectious intermediate or posterior uveitis participating in the HURON trial, a 26-week, multicenter, masked, randomized, sham-controlled trial of a dexamethasone intravitreal implant (n=224) was performed. Patient-reported outcome measures included the National Eye Institute Visual Function Questionnaire-25, the 36-Item Short-Form Health Survey, the Short Form-6 Dimensions, and the EuroQol-5D. The National Eye Institute Visual Function Questionnaire-25 scores from the HURON uveitis population were compared with published National Eye Institute Visual Function Questionnaire-25 scores from a normal-vision reference group (n=122). The 36-Item Short-Form Health Survey, Short Form-6 Dimensions, and EuroQol-5D scores were compared with the US general population using data from the National Health Measurement Study (n=3844) and the Medical Expenditure Panel Survey (n=955).
RESULTS: Compared with a normal-vision population, the HURON uveitis population had clinically significant impairments across all National Eye Institute Visual Function Questionnaire-25 subscales and the composite score, with all subscale score differences exceeding 10 points (P< .001). The HURON uveitis population had significantly lower 36-Item Short-Form Health Survey mental component summary and Short Form-6 Dimensions scores compared with a US general population sample (P< .001). No significant differences were found for the 36-Item Short-Form Health Survey physical component summary and EuroQol-5D scores between the uveitis and US general population samples.
CONCLUSIONS: Compared with the US general population and normal-vision reference groups, noninfectious intermediate or posterior uveitis results in meaningful reductions in mental health outcomes, health-related quality of life, and vision-related functioning.

Uveitis is a sight-threatening intraocular inflammatory disorder which may occur from both infectious and non-infectious or autoimmune causes. The frequency of infectious uveitis and autoimmune uveitis varies depending on countries and regions. According to a nationwide survey conducted by the Japanese Ocular Inflammation Society, infectious and non-infectious uveitis accounted for 16.4 and 50.1% of new patients, respectively while the remaining 33.5% of new uveitis cases were not classified or were idiopathic uveitis. Infectious uveitis is particularly important because it causes tissue damage to the eye and may result in blindness unless treated. However, it can be treated if the pathogenic microorganisms are identified promptly and accurately. Remarkable advancements in molecular and immunological technologies have been made in the last decade, and the diagnosis of infectious uveitis has been greatly improved by the application of molecular and immunological investigations, particularly polymerase chain reaction (PCR). PCR performed on a small amount of ocular samples provides a prompt, sensitive, and specific molecular diagnosis of pathogenic microorganisms in the eye. This technology has opened a new era in the diagnosis and treatment of uveitis, enabling physicians to establish new clinical entities of uveitis caused by infectious microorganisms, identify pathogens in the eyes of many patients with uveitis, and determine prompt diagnosis and appropriate therapy. Here we review the PCR process, new PCR tests specialized for ocular diseases, microorganisms detected by the PCR tests, diseases in the eye caused by these microorganisms, and the clinical characteristics, diagnosis, and therapy of uveitis.",17,2017-Jan-1

Uveitis is a generic term for inflammation of the uvea, which includes the iris, ciliary body, and choroid. Prevalence of underlying non-infectious uveitis varies by race and region and is a major cause of legal blindness in developed countries. Although the etiology remains unclear, the involvement of both genetic and environmental factors is considered important for the onset of many forms of non-infectious uveitis. Major histocompatibility complex (MHC) genes, which play a major role in human immune response, have been reported to be strongly associated as genetic risk factors in several forms of non-infectious uveitis. Behçet's disease, acute anterior uveitis (AAU), and chorioretinopathy are strongly correlated with MHC class I-specific alleles. Moreover, sarcoidosis and Vogt-Koyanagi-Harada (VKH) disease are associated with MHC class II-specific alleles. These correlations can help immunogenetically classify the immune pathway involved in each form of non-infectious uveitis. Genetic studies, including recent genome-wide association studies, have identified several susceptibility genes apart from those in the MHC region. These genetic findings help define the common or specific pathogenesis of ocular inflammatory diseases by comparing the susceptibility genes of each form of non-infectious uveitis. Interestingly, genome-wide association of the interleukin (IL)23R region has been identified in many of the major forms of non-infectious uveitis, such as Behçet's disease, ocular sarcoidosis, VKH disease, and AAU.

Noninfectious uveitis is a sight-threatening immune-mediated intraocular inflammatory disorder. The inheritance of uveitis in multiplex families and its association with known monogenic and polygenic immunologic disorders suggests that common genetic variants underlie susceptibility to uveitis as well as to other immunologic disorders. TNFA and IL10 are strong candidate genes, given the influence of these cytokines on inflammation, immune tolerance, and apoptosis.
METHODS: The role of 12 polymorphisms spanning the TNFA and IL10 genomic regions was investigated in 192 uveitis patients and 92 population control subjects from four regional centers in the United Kingdom and Republic of Ireland.
RESULTS: The results demonstrate that uveitis is associated with three haplotype-tagging SNPs (htSNPs) in the IL10 gene: htSNP2 (rs6703630), htSNP5 (rs2222202), and htSNP6 (rs3024490). IL10htSNP2AG/htSNP5TC was the most significantly associated haplotype (P = 0.00085), whereas the LTA+252AA/TNFhtSNP2GG haplotype was protective (P = 0.00031). Furthermore, subgroup analysis showed that the frequency of the TNFd4 allele was higher in patients with nonremitting ocular disease and/or those requiring higher levels of maintenance immunosuppression. Although these associations lost significance after Bonferroni correction, they infer a relationship that may be validated by a larger study.
CONCLUSIONS: Since these variants are implicated in the susceptibility and severity of several immunologic disorders, the results support the hypothesis that common genetic determinants influence shared mechanisms of autoimmunity.",17,2010-Aug-1

To determine the risk factors for the development of cataract in children with uveitis of any etiology.
DESIGN: Cohort study.
METHODS: Two hundred forty-seven eyes of 140 children with uveitis were evaluated for the development of vision-affecting cataract. Demographic, clinical, and treatment data were collected between the time of presentation and the first instance cataract was recorded or findings at final follow-up. Main outcome measures included the prevalence of cataract and distribution by type of uveitis, incidence of new onset cataract time to cataract development, and risk factors for the development of cataract.
RESULTS: The prevalence of cataract in our cohort was 44.2% and was highest among eyes with panuveitis (77.1%), chronic anterior uveitis (48.3%), and intermediate uveitis (48.0%). The overall incidence of newly diagnosed cataract was 0.09 per eye-year, with an estimated 69% to develop uveitis-related cataract with time. The main factors related with cataract development were the number of uveitis flares per year (hazard ratio [HR] = 3.06 [95% confidence interval {CI}, 2.15-4.35], P < .001), cystoid macular edema (HR = 2.87 [95% CI, 1.41-5.82], P = .004), posterior synechia at presentation (HR = 2.85 [95% CI, 1.53-5.30], P = .001), and use of local injections of corticosteroids (HR = 2.37 [95% CI, 1.18-4.75], P = .02). Treatments with systemic and topical corticosteroids were not significant risk factors.
CONCLUSIONS: In this study, we found that development of cataract is common among pediatric eyes with uveitis and is most strongly related to the extent of inflammation recurrences and ocular complications. We suggest that controlling the inflammation, even using higher doses of systemic and topical corticosteroids, is of importance in preventing ocular complications, such as cataract.",17,2017-May-1

To investigate the anti-inflammatory properties of ripasudil, a Rho kinase (ROCK) inhibitor, using endotoxin-induced uveitis (EIU) in rats.
METHODS: Endotoxin-induced uveitis was induced by footpad injection of lipopolysaccharide (LPS). Ripasudil was administered intraperitoneally 1 hour before and after LPS injection. The aqueous humor was collected 24 hours after injection, and the infiltrating cells, protein concentration, and levels of monocyte chemotactic protein-1 (MCP-1) were determined. Infiltrating cells in the iris ciliary body (ICB) and adherent leukocytes in retinal vessels were evaluated. The mRNA levels of IL-1β, IL-6, TNF-α, and MCP-1 in the retina and ICB were determined. A mouse macrophage cell line, RAW264.7, was stimulated with LPS in the presence or absence of ripasudil, and the expression of MCP-1 and nuclear translocation of nuclear factor (NF)-κB was analyzed.
RESULTS: Ripasudil significantly reduced infiltrating cells and protein exudation in the aqueous humor, as well as the number of infiltrating cells in the ICB and adherent leukocytes in retinal vessels in EIU. Additionally, the protein level of MCP-1 in the aqueous humor and mRNA levels of IL-1β, IL-6, TNF-α, MCP-1, and intercellular adhesion molecule-1 in the ICB and retina were suppressed by ripasudil. The production of MCP-1 and nuclear translocation of NF-κB in RAW264.7 cells were also suppressed by ripasudil.
CONCLUSIONS: The Rho/ROCK pathway plays a role in adhesion molecule expression and inflammatory cell infiltration in EIU, and ripasudil is a potent anti-inflammatory agent against ocular inflammatory diseases, including acute uveitis and possibly uveitic glaucoma.",17,2017-Oct-01

Previously described models of endotoxin-induced uveitis quantify neutrophil influx into the eye using biochemical or direct cell count methods that result in an underestimation of ocular leukocyte accumulation following the inflammatory stimulus. We have optimized the rat model of endotoxin-induced uveitis by first overcoming interference in the biochemical assay of myeloperoxidase due to endogenous ocular reductants and cellular constituents containing free thiol functional groups. This was accomplished by simultaneously 1) extensively diluting soluble, interfering substances and 2) blocking tissue sulfhydril functional groups during tissue homogenization. Uveitis was induced in rats by subplantar injection of endotoxin. Twenty-four hours later, eyes were enucleated, homogenized, fractionated, and myeloperoxidase activity of neutrophils sedimenting with the membranous pellet was extracted. Previously published extraction procedures yielded only 40% of total assayable myeloperoxidase activity. Optimal recovery of myeloperoxidase activity (>twofold increase) was achieved only with two sequential extractions using 50 mM phosphate buffer (pH 7.4) containing 10 mM N-ethylmaleimide, and subsequent solubilization of myeloperoxidase activity by extraction with 0.5% hexadecyltrimethylammonium bromide in 50 mM phosphate buffer (pH 6.0). This modified extraction procedure and optimized myeloperoxidase assay conditions (300 microM hydrogen peroxide and 1.5 mM o-dianisidine) were then used to enhance the uveitis model. Maximum ocular neutrophil accumulation was observed at endotoxin doses of 100-200 microg. Total ocular neutrophil infiltrations ranged from 250,000 to 800,000 cells/globe. This leukocyte influx was inhibited dose-dependently by topical ocular administration of dexamethasone, with half-maximal inhibition observed at a concentration of 0.01%, w/v. Further validated by the correlation of biochemical results with histological evaluation, the refined methodology described in this report has application in assessing the ophthalmic therapeutic potential of antiinflammatory agents.",17,1998-Apr-1

Acute anterior uveitis (AAU) is the most common form of uveitis, accounting for approximately 90% of all cases. Half of all cases of AAU are HLA-B27 positive. The disease is typically acute in onset, unilateral, nongranulomatous inflammation involving the iris and ciliary body, with a tendency to recurrent attacks. Approximately 50% of all patients with HLA-B27 AAU develop an associated seronegative arthritis (SNA), while approximately 25% of the patients initially diagnosed with HLA-B27 SNA develop AAU. Environmental factors play a critical role in the pathogenesis of AAU; in particular, bacterial triggers have been strongly implicated in the development of this disease. Topical corticosteroids and cycloplegic agents remain the cornerstones of treatment for AAU. Salazopirine and methotrexate are effective in decreasing recurrent attacks. Biological agents such as anti-TNF and anti-CD20 therapy may be effective in refractory severe AU but are rarely required.",17,2011-Apr-1

Intraocular inflammatory diseases are collectively known as uveitis. The aetiology of this condition can be diverse, as inflammation may result from direct involvement of the uveal tract or indirect inflammation of adjacent tissues. Uveitis can present challenges to diagnosis and treatment, and is potentially a severe sight-threatening disease. In the elderly, uveitis can present de novo after the age of 60 years or may represent a process earlier in life continuing after the age of 60 years, although many cases will have become quiescent by that time. More recent studies suggest that uveitis presenting after 60 years of age is more common than previously believed. Most cases of uveitis are of unknown aetiology and are classed as idiopathic, although sarcoidosis, ocular ischaemia and birdshot chorioretinopathy are recognised non-infectious causes of uveitis in the elderly. Systemic immunosuppression, with its well known complications, may be required to preserve vision. In this age group, one should always have high suspicion of a masquerade syndrome, particularly a primary CNS non-Hodgkin's lymphoma. With the demographics of the elderly population changing and mean life expectancy increasing, it is important that clinicians are familiar with uveitis as a potential cause of visual impairment in this age group.",17,2006-1-1

Ankylosing spondylitis (AS) and related forms of spondyloarthritis (SpA) are associated with some extra-articular features, and the most common symptomatic association is with acute anterior uveitis (AAU). Thus, approximately 40 % of patients with AS will experience a sudden onset of a unilateral anterior uveitis sometime during the course of their disease. Patients with AAU, especially those who are HLA-B27 positive, should be questioned about inflammatory low back pain and also evaluated for other clinical features of SpA. Since a prolonged delay in diagnosis is common among SpA patients and occurrence of AAU may be the reason for their first interaction with medical care, occurrence of AAU presents a unique opportunity for identifying such undiagnosed SpA patients. Therefore, a novel evidence-based algorithm called Dublin Uveitis Evaluation Tool (DUET) has been proposed to guide ophthalmologists and primary care physicians to refer appropriate AAU patients to rheumatologists. In a large two-phase study, approximately 40 % of patients presenting with idiopathic AAU were noted to have undiagnosed SpA, and DUET algorithm was noted to have excellent sensitivity (96 %) and specificity (97 %). It has a positive likelihood ratio (LR) 41.5 and negative LR 0.03. In most instances, the eye inflammation responds well to corticosteroid and mydriatic eye drops and without the need for additional therapy. Use of oral corticosteroids is reserved for patients, especially with associated chronic inflammatory bowel disease or psoriatic arthritis presenting with bilateral, chronic, anterior, and/or intermediate uveitis, and this treatment is rarely needed for more than a couple of weeks. A very small percentage may be more refractory to such treatment and require potential novel therapies, including the use of tumor necrosis factor blockers.",17,2015-Sep-1

Uveitis is usually considered as an intraocular inflammation characterized by variety of clinical features. Behcet's disease (BD), Vogt-Koyanagi-Harada (VKH) syndrome, acute anterior uveitis (AAU), and birdshot chorioretinopathy (BCR) are examples of noninfectious forms of uveitis. Although the precise pathogenesis remains unclear, accumulating evidence shows that complex genetic backgrounds coupled with an aberrant immune response may be implicated in the development of uveitis. The complement and pattern recognition systems are both important factors of the innate immune system and are involved in the pathogenesis of uveitis. Copy number variants (CNVs) of complement component 4 have been found to be associated with BD and VKH syndrome, but not with AAU. Several CNVs and gene polymorphisms of toll-like receptors were found to be associated with BD. Leukocytes are an important part of the adaptive immune system and various molecules on these cells play an important role in the development of uveitis. Genes encoding for human leukocyte antigens (HLAs) have been shown to be associated with certain uveitis entities, including BD (HLA-B51), VKH syndrome (HLA-DR4, DRB1/DQA1), AAU (HLA-B27), and BCR (HLA-A29). Genome wide association studies showed that the IL-23R locus was a shared risk factor for multiple uveitis entities including BD, AAU, and VKH syndrome. In addition, various other non-HLA genes are also associated with BD or VKH syndrome, such as IL-10, STAT4, STAT3, and UBAC2. These studies support the hypothesis that genetic factors play a key role in the pathogenesis of uveitis.",17,2015-1-1

Corticosteroids are used as first-line treatment for many ocular inflammatory conditions. The risk of adverse effects, however, necessitates conversion to steroid-sparing immunomodulatory therapy (IMT) for disease that is recurrent, chronic, or poorly responsive to treatment. Combination drug treatments with multiple agent 'recipes' are also considered. Immunomodulatory agents include the broad categories of antimetabolites (azathioprine, methotrexate, mycophenolate mofetil), alkylating agents (cyclophosphamide, chlorambucil), T-cell inhibitors (cyclosporine, tacrolimus), and cytokines (interferon alfa).

To describe the demographic and clinical profiles of uveitis patients seen at secondary and tertiary care centers in Turkey.
METHODS: A nationwide web-based registry of patients with uveitis was initiated in November 2008. We analyzed data from a single baseline registry-enrollment visit.
RESULTS: In 33 centers, 6967 eyes of 4863 consecutive patients were registered. The mean age at presentation was 36.6 ± 15.7 (1-92) years; 51.3% were male. Behçet disease was the leading diagnosis (24.9%), followed by ankylosing spondylitis and/or HLA-B27-associated anterior uveitis (9.7%), toxoplasmosis (7.1%), Fuchs uveitis (6.3%), and presumed herpetic anterior uveitis (6.0%). Visual acuity was 0.1 or worse in 22% of eyes. The most common ocular complications were posterior synechiae (16.2%) and cataract formation (16.2%).

Most human autoimmune diseases have a relapsing-remitting or a chronic progressive course, while animal models are usually acute and monophasic. In our experimental animal model the disease can be either monophasic or remitting, depending on the autoantigen used for induction, and it appears to lie in the effector phenotype of the elicited T helper cell response. Since both, monophasic and relapsing courses of disease are induced by immunization as well as by adoptive transfer of peptide-specific, CD4(+) T cells, we were able to directly compare the transcriptomes of pathogenic T cell lines by gene array analysis and qPCR as well as protein expression. Upregulated genes were only determined in T cells inducing relapsing uveitis and belong to certain pathways of antigen presentation, activation, inflammation, migration and survival, comprising WNT, Hedgehog, MAP-kinase and JAK/STAT-pathways. These pathways are partially interacting with each other, and the central molecule upregulated in T cells causing relapsing disease was found to be IFN-γ. Here the course of the autoimmune diseases strictly depends on the characteristics of the autoreactive T cells, which are already determined at their early stage of antigen-specific activation.

To evaluate the etiology of uveitis and its associated systemic findings in a referral hospital in Ankara, Turkey.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: Clinical records of patients in our uveitis department were reviewed retrospectively and 419 eyes of 300 consecutive patients were included in the study. Cases of uveitis due to postoperative endophthalmitis, perforating injuries, and foreign bodies were excluded from the study. The data, including sex, age, clinical presentation, disease course and outcome, ocular involvement, etiology, and associated systemic findings, were entered into a computer database. Pearson chi-square statistical analysis was performed to analyze the data whenever necessary.
RESULTS: The study subjects consisted of 162 males and 138 females, with a female to male ratio of 1:1.17 and an average age of 35.7 years. Anterior uveitis was the most common form of uveitis with 43.6%, followed by posterior uveitis (26.6%), panuveitis (20.6%), and intermediate uveitis (9%). Idiopathic uveitis (28.3%) was the most frequent cause of uveitis diagnosed, followed by Behçet's disease (26%) and rheumatic diseases (9%). In 215 (71.7%) out of 300 patients, a specific cause of uveitis with associated systemic findings was identified. Uveitis was attributed to an infectious etiology in only 41 patients (13.6%) of the entire study population.
COMMENTS: The etiology of uveitis and its associated systemic findings may vary depending on the geographic distribution of patients and local factors. These results represent those of patients with uveitis referred to hospitals in central Anatolia.",17,2005-Feb-1

Several proteins are investigated as candidate auto-antigens in the pathogenesis of Behçet's disease (BD). This study aimed to screen the cellular responses to auto-antigen (alphaB-crystallin, alphaBC), and microorganism (Streptococcus sangius KTH-1 BES-1 protein) derived peptides as well as to isopentenyl pyrophosphate (IPP). Peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC) from 22 BD patients and 22 healthy controls (HC) were stimulated in vitro with alphaBC, BES-1 peptides, IPP and PPD and induced proliferation as well as the secreted interleukin (IL)-12 and interferon (IFN)-gamma production levels were measured. We did not observe any significant difference in cellular proliferation between BD patients and HC. Induction of IL-12 secretion with alphaBC was stronger in BD patients (P = 0.04) and in the disease subgroup with uveitis (P = 0.027) compared the HC. When responses to PPD were compared, proliferation of PMBC was lower (P = 0.03), whereas IL-12 secretion was higher in BD (P = 0.04) as well as in patients under colchicum treatment (P = 0.04) and with vascular involvement (P = 0.006) compared to HC. BES-1(373-385 )peptide induced also higher IL-12 productions by PBMC of BD patients (P = 0.017) and of patients with uveitis (P = 0.013). Finally, IPP stimulated higher IL-12 secretions from PBMC in BD patients (P = 0.035) and in patients with (P = 0.02) or without (P = 0.017) uveitis or arthritis (P = 0.04), under colchicum treatment (P = 0.01) or not receiving any immunosuppressive treatment (P = 0.007) compared to HC. These results suggest a more prominent pro-inflammatory cytokine secretion from PBMC in BD patients compared to HC in response to various antigens including alphaBC protein, BES-1(373-385), IPP and PPD.",17,2007-Oct-1

S100B is a Ca2+ binding protein and is typically associated with brain and CNS disorders. However, the role of S100B in an inflammatory situation is not clear. The aim of the study was to determine whether S100B is likely to influence inflammation through its effect on macrophages. A murine macrophage cell line (RAW 264.7) and primary bone marrow derived macrophages were used for in vitro studies and a model of retinal inflammatory disease in which pathogenesis is highly dependent on macrophage infiltration, Experimental Autoimmune Uveoretinitis, for in vitro study. Experimental Autoimmune Uveoretinitis is a model for the human disease posterior endogenous uveoretinitis, a potentially blinding condition, with an autoimmune aetiology, that mainly affects the working age group. To date the involvement of S100B in autoimmune uveoretinitis has not been investigated. Real-time PCR array analysis on RAW 246.7 cells indicated up-regulation of gene expression for various cytokines/chemokines in response to S100B, IL-1β and CCL22 in particular and this was confirmed by real-time PCR. In addition flow cytometry and ELISA confirmed up-regulation of protein production in response to S100B for pro-IL-1β and CCL22 respectively. This was the case for both RAW 264.7 cells and bone marrow derived macrophages. Induction of EAU with retinal antigen in mice in which S100B had been deleted resulted in a significantly reduced level of disease compared to wild-type mice, as determined by topical endoscopic fundus imaging and histology grading. Macrophage infiltration was also significantly reduced in S100B deleted mice. Real-time PCR analysis indicated that this was associated with reduction in CCL22 and IL-1β in retinas from S100B knock-out mice. In conclusion S100B augments the inflammatory response in uveoretinitis and this is likely to be, at least in part, via a direct effect on macrophages.",17,2015-1-1

Multiple studies around the world suggest that syphilis is re-emerging. Ocular syphilis - with a wide range of presentations, most of which are subtypes of uveitis - has become an increasingly common cause of ocular inflammation over the past 20 years. Its rising incidence, diagnostic complexity, and manifestations that have only recently been characterized make ocular syphilis relevant from the public health, clinical, and scientific perspectives. We review the demographics, epidemiology, clinical features, ocular imaging findings, diagnosis, and medical management of this condition.",17,2022-1-1

Patients with anterior uveitis may be treated with topical therapy alone but patients with posterior uveitis and those with sight threatening complications of anterior uveitis usually require systemic treatment especially if the disease is bilateral. The mainstay of treatment is corticosteroids and additional immunosuppressive agents such as cyclosporin and mycophenolate are used when necessary. There remains a significant cohort of patients in whom this therapy is either not tolerated or is ineffective. The use of the anti-tumour necrosis factor (TNF) antibodies has been very successful in controlling other immune-mediated disorders such as rheumatoid arthritis and has subsequently been extended to use in other arthritidies and other disorders such as psoriasis and Crohn's disease. TNF is known to play a key role in ocular inflammation as shown by animal studies and its detection in the ocular fluids of inflamed eyes in man. In some disorders all types of anti-TNF antibodies have similar efficacy but that does not appear to be the case with uveitis where infliximab is at present looking to be more effective than etanercept. The data on the use of anti-TNF drugs in uveitis is presented together with new data on its role as a steroid sparing agent.",17,2006-Feb-21

Sarcoidosis is an idiopathic inflammatory disorder involving multiple organs, and ocular manifestation (represented by granulomatous uveitis) is one of the common features. A well-known immunologic feature in sarcoidosis is an increased CD4+ helper T-cell type 1 lymphocyte subset in bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) fluid. The current study investigated the vitreous lymphocyte subsets of ocular sarcoidosis to elucidate the immunologic features of this disorder in the eye.
DESIGN: Case-control study.
PARTICIPANTS AND CONTROLS: Fifty-one eyes of 38 patients with ocular sarcoidosis, confirmed by international diagnostic criteria, were enrolled in this study. Twenty-seven eyes of 26 patients with other causes of uveitis were enrolled as nonsarcoid controls.
METHODS: Evaluation of diagnostic tests for cell profiles of ocular sarcoidosis. Lymphocytes in the vitreous samples were analyzed by cytology, polymerase chain reaction, and flow cytometry. Peripheral blood was also obtained from each patient and analyzed in comparison with the vitreous samples.
MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: CD4/CD8 ratios of vitreal and peripheral T lymphocytes.
RESULTS: CD4/CD8 ratios of the vitreous T lymphocytes were significantly higher in ocular sarcoidosis than in nonsarcoidosis vitreous samples. In the patients with ocular sarcoidosis, the CD4/CD8 ratios of vitreal T lymphocytes were significantly higher than the CD4/CD8 ratios of peripheral T lymphocytes. No significant differences were found between the CD4/CD8 ratios of vitreal and peripheral T lymphocytes in the patients without sarcoidosis. Moreover, the CD4/CD8 ratios of peripheral T lymphocytes in the patients with ocular sarcoidosis were significantly higher than in patients without sarcoidosis. The sensitivity and specificity of the vitreal CD4/CD8 ratio were 100% and 96.3%, respectively, for the diagnosis of ocular sarcoidosis.
CONCLUSIONS: Our findings suggest that the CD4/CD8 ratio of vitreous-infiltrating lymphocytes has high diagnostic value in ocular sarcoidosis, comparable to that of the CD4/CD8 ratio in BAL fluid lymphocytosis for pulmonary sarcoidosis. Furthermore, a high CD4/CD8 ratio of peripheral blood T lymphocytes should be one of the laboratory findings for ocular sarcoidosis. Diagnostic vitrectomy using flow cytometric analysis may be a useful adjunct for the diagnosis of ocular sarcoidosis, particularly in complex cases.",17,2012-Nov-1

Viral infection has been assigned some role in the pathogenesis of Behçet's disease (BD). Defects in natural killer (NK) cell repertoire may be involved in impaired antiviral immunity, leading to the development of BD. We studied killer inhibitory receptor (KIR) expression in 40 patients with BD. CD94 and CD158b expression of NK cells was normal in a great majority of BD patients. NKB1 expression was reduced in eight and increased in six. Twelve of these 14 patients (86%) had severe eye disease. Some had reduced NKB1 and enhanced CD158a expression simultaneously, or enhanced NKB1 and reduced CD158a simultaneously, suggesting a skewed NK cell repertoire in BD. Collectively, KIR expression was abnormal in the BD patients with severe eye disease. This may result from genetic predisposition, or certain viruses may affect the KIR repertoire formation in BD patients. Abnormal KIR expression of NK cells may be associated with the development of BD.",17,2004-Jul-1

To assess the risk of vaccine-associated uveitis (VAU) after severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) vaccination and evaluate uveitis onset interval and clinical presentations in the patients.
DESIGN: A retrospective study from December 11, 2020, to May 9, 2022, using the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention Vaccine Adverse Event Reporting System.
PARTICIPANTS: Patients diagnosed with VAU after administration of BNT162b2 (Pfizer-BioNTech, Pfizer Inc/BioNTech SE), mRNA-1273 (Moderna, Moderna Therapeutics Inc), and Ad26.COV2.S (Janssen, Janssen Pharmaceuticals) vaccine worldwide.
METHODS: A descriptive analysis of the demographics, clinical history, and presentation was performed. We evaluated the correlation among the 3 vaccines and continuous and categorical variables. A post hoc analysis was performed between uveitis onset interval after vaccination and age, dose, and vaccine type. Finally, a 30-day risk analysis for VAU onset postvaccination was performed.
MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: The estimated global crude reporting rate, observed to expected ratio of VAU in the United States, associated ocular and systemic presentations, and onset duration.
RESULTS: A total of 1094 cases of VAU were reported from 40 countries with an estimated crude reporting rate (per million doses) of 0.57, 0.44, and 0.35 for BNT162b2, mRNA-1273, and Ad26.COV2.S, respectively. The observed to expected ratio of VAU was comparable for BNT162b2 (0.023), mRNA-1273 (0.025), and Ad26.COV2.S (0.027). Most cases of VAU were reported in patients who received BNT162b2 (n = 853, 77.97%). The mean age of patients with VAU was 46.24 ± 16.93 years, and 68.65% (n = 751) were women. Most cases were reported after the first dose (n = 452, 41.32%) and within the first week (n = 591, 54.02%) of the vaccination. The onset interval for VAU was significantly longer in patients who received mRNA-1273 (21.22 ± 42.74 days) compared with BNT162b2 (11.42 ± 23.16 days) and rAd26.COV2.S (12.69 ± 16.02 days) vaccines (P < 0.0001). The post hoc analysis revealed a significantly shorter interval of onset for the BNT162b2 compared with the mRNA 1273 vaccine (P < 0.0001). The 30-day risk analysis showed a significant difference among the 3 vaccines (P < 0.0001).
CONCLUSIONS: The low crude reporting rate and observed to expected ratio suggest a low safety concern for VAU. This study provides insights into a possible temporal association between reported VAU events and SARS-CoV-2 vaccines; however, further investigations are required to delineate the associated immunological mechanisms.",17,2023-Feb-1

There is not yet a commonly accepted, standardized approach in the treatment of juvenile idiopathic uveitis when initial steroid therapy is insufficient. We sought to assess current practice patterns within a large cohort of children with juvenile uveitis.
METHODS: This is a cross-sectional cohort study of patients with uveitis enrolled in the Childhood Arthritis and Rheumatology Research Alliance (CARRAnet) registry. Clinical information including, demographic information, presenting features, disease complications, and medications were collected. Chi-square and Fisher's exact tests were used to assess for associations between medications and clinical characteristics.
RESULTS: Ninety-two children with idiopathic and 656 with juvenile idiopathic arthritis (JIA)-associated uveitis were identified. Indication (arthritis or uveitis) for medication use was not available for JIA patients; therefore, detailed analysis was limited to children with idiopathic uveitis. In this group, 94 % had received systemic steroids. Methotrexate (MTX) was used in 76 % of patients, with oral and subcutaneous forms given at similar rates. In multivariable analysis, non-Caucasians were more likely to be treated initially with subcutaneous MTX (P = 0.003). Of the 53 % of patients treated with a biologic DMARD, all received a tumor necrosis factor (TNF) inhibitor. TNF inhibitor use was associated with a higher frequency of cataracts (52 % vs 21 %; P = 0.001) and antinuclear antibody positivity (49 % vs 29 %; P = 0.04), although overall complication rates were not higher in these patients.
CONCLUSION: Among idiopathic uveitis patients enrolled in the CARRAnet registry, MTX was the most commonly used DMARD, with subcutaneous and oral forms equally favored. Patients who received a TNF inhibitor were more likely to be ANA positive and have cataracts.",17,2016-Feb-16

Cellular retinaldehyde binding protein (CRALBP) is an autoantigen in spontaneous equine recurrent uveitis. In order to test whether CRALBP contributes to human autoimmune uveitis, the specificity of antibodies from human uveitis patient's sera was first evaluated in two-dimensional (2D) Western blot analysis. Subsequent identification of the immunoreactive proteins by mass spectrometry resulted in the identification of CRALBP as a putative autoantigen. Additionally, sera from human uveitis and control patients were by Western blot using purified human recombinant CRALBP. Anti-CRALBP autoantibodies occur more frequently (P<.01) in human uveitis patients than in normal controls. Thirty out of 56 tested uveitis patient's sera contained autoantibodies reactive against CRALBP, compared to only four out of 23 normal control subjects. The presence of CRALBP autoantibodies in 54% of tested uveitis patients supports CRALBP as a possible autoantigen in human autoimmune uveitis.",17,2007-1-1

To describe recent evidence from the literature regarding cataract surgery and lens implantation in patients with uveitis.
RECENT FINDINGS: Most uveitic patients enjoy good vision despite potentially sight-threatening complications, including cataract development. In those patients who develop cataracts, successful surgery stems from educated patient selection, careful surgical technique, and aggressive preoperative and postoperative control of inflammation. Although commonly accepted in the adult patient population, recent investigations reflect the increased tolerance for primary intraocular lens placement in the pediatric cohort. The role of absolute control of inflammation continues with greater focus on immunomodulatory therapies. However, these agents bear their own side effect and complication profiles, including recent evidence of increased mortality. As a result, localized treatment with not only these agents but also with corticosteroids offers a potential balance.
SUMMARY: Cataract extraction with intraocular lens implantation in the setting of meticulous control of inflammation can optimize visual outcome in adults and children with uveitis.",17,2010-Jan-1

Syphilitic uveitis is re-emerging alongside the systemic infection. In July 2017, an international group of uveitis-specialised ophthalmologists formed the International Ocular Syphilis Study Group to define current practice patterns.
METHODS: 103 Study Group members based in 35 countries completed a 25-item questionnaire focused on case load, clinical presentations, use and interpretation of investigations, treatment and clinical indicators of poor prognosis.
RESULTS: Members managed a mean of 6.1 patients with syphilitic uveitis in clinics that averaged 707 annual cases of uveitis (0.9%); 53.2% reported increasing numbers over the past decade. Patients presented to more members (40.2%) during secondary syphilis. Uveitis was usually posterior (60.8%) or pan (22.5%); complications included optic neuropathy, macular oedema and posterior synechiae. All members diagnosed syphilitic uveitis using serological tests (simultaneous or sequential testing algorithms), and 97.0% routinely checked for HIV co-infection. Cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) analysis was ordered by 90.2% of members, and 92.7% took uveitis plus Venereal Disease Research Laboratory test (VDRL) or fluorescent treponemal antibody absorption test (FTA-ABS) to indicate neurosyphilis. Patients were commonly co-managed with infectious disease physicians, and treated with penicillin for at least 10-14 days, plus corticosteroid. Features predicting poor outcome included optic neuropathy (86.3%) and initial misdiagnosis (63.7%). Reasons for delayed diagnosis were often practitioner-related. 82.5% of members tested every patient they managed with uveitis for syphilis.
CONCLUSION: This comprehensive report by an international group of uveitis-specialised ophthalmologists provides a current approach for the management of syphilitic uveitis.",17,2019-Nov-1

Twenty-one patients with syphilitic posterior uveitis were investigated retrospectively to study the disease spectrum, associations with neurosyphilis, and therapeutic implications. Ophthalmologic manifestations of syphilitic posterior uveitis are differentiated into acute and chronic uveitides. The several distinct acute uveitic syndromes are usually florid and are associated with early syphilis, with VDRL-positive syphilitic meningitis, and frequently with human immunodeficiency virus coinfection. The chronic posterior uveitides are often insidious, a manifestation of late syphilis, and associated commonly with subclinical neurosyphilis. All patients with acute cases and 54% of patients with chronic cases in our study received penicillin therapy appropriate for neurosyphilis. The frequent association of syphilitic posterior uveitis with neurosyphilis and the analogous spirochetal sequestration beyond the blood-brain and the blood-ocular barriers suggest that all patients with syphilitic posterior uveitis, irrespective of ocular disease intensity, should undergo evaluation of cerebrospinal fluid and be treated with penicillin regimens appropriate for neurosyphilis.",17,2001-Jun-15

To investigate the prevalence of ocular manifestations and visual outcomes in patients with herpes zoster ophthalmicus (HZO).
METHODS: Consecutive cases diagnosed with HZO who attended 2 hospitals between July 1, 2011, and June 30, 2015, were retrospectively reviewed. Patient demographics, clinical presentations, and management were reviewed. The logistic regression model was used to estimate the odds ratio of visual loss with ocular manifestations.
RESULTS: A total of 259 patients were included. Of these, 110 (42.5%) patients were <60 years old and 149 patients (57.5%) were ≥60 years old. None of the patients had received zoster vaccination before presentation. Ocular manifestations were present in 170 (65.6%) patients with no difference between both age groups (P = 0.101). Conjunctivitis was the most common ocular manifestation, followed by anterior uveitis and keratitis. After resolution of HZO, 58.7% of patients had a visual acuity of 6/12 or worse. Epithelial keratitis and stromal keratitis were independent risk factors for visual loss after resolution of HZO (P = 0.003 and P = 0.004, respectively). The corresponding odds ratio was 6.59 [95% confidence interval (CI): 1.87-23.19] and 7.55 (95% CI: 1.88-30.30), respectively. The number of ocular manifestations was also associated with an increased risk of visual loss with an odds ratio of 1.49 (95% CI: 1.01-2.20; P = 0.043).
CONCLUSIONS: A substantial proportion of patients with HZO were <60 years old in this study. The absence of zoster vaccination across the study cohort was noteworthy. Keratitis was the main reason for poor visual outcome in these patients.",17,2017-Mar-1

We examined the role of CD40/CD40L interactions on the development of experimental autoimmune uveoretinitis (EAU), a cell-mediated, Th1-driven autoimmune disease that serves as a model for autoimmune uveitis in humans. EAU-susceptible B10.RIII mice immunized with the retinal autoantigen interphotoreceptor retinoid binding protein in CFA and treated with anti-CD40L Ab (MR1) had reduced incidence and severity of disease. Real-time PCR analysis revealed that the innate and adaptive responses of protected mice were reduced, without an obvious shift toward a Th2 cytokine profile. In contrast to some other reports, no evidence was found for regulatory cells in adoptive transfer experiments. To determine whether CD40L blockade resulted in long-term tolerance, mice protected by treatment with MR1 Ab were rechallenged for uveitis after circulating MR1 Ab levels dropped below the detection limit of ELISA. MR1-treated mice developed severe EAU and strong cellular responses to interphotoreceptor retinoid binding protein, comparable to those of control mice. These responses were higher than in mice that had not received the primary immunization concurrently with anti-CD40L treatment. We conclude that 1) CD40/CD40L interaction is required for EAU and its disruption prevents disease development; 2) CD40L blockade inhibits the innate response to immunization and reduces priming, but does not result in immune deviation; and 3) protection is dependent on persistence of anti-CD40L Abs, and long-term tolerance is not induced. Furthermore, immunological memory develops under cover of CD40L blockade causing enhanced responses upon rechallenge. Taken together, our data suggest that ongoing CD40/CD40L blockade might be required to maintain a therapeutic effect against uveitis.",17,2005-Jul-01

To identify the risk factors for ocular hypertension and secondary glaucoma in children with uveitis.
DESIGN: Retrospective observational case series of 147 patient records.
PARTICIPANTS: Two hundred fifty-six eyes of 147 children with uveitis diagnosed before the age of 16 years.
METHODS: Data were obtained from the medical records of children with uveitis evaluated at our institute from 1990 through 2004.
MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Localization and course of uveitis (acute or chronic), underlying systemic disease, onset of ocular hypertension, onset of secondary glaucoma, treatment with steroids, antinuclear antibodies (ANAs), lens extractions, number of blind eyes at onset and during follow-up, and the duration of follow-up.
RESULTS: Elevated intraocular pressure developed in 35% of children with pediatric uveitis regardless of the form or type of uveitis during a follow-up of 5 years. Secondary glaucoma, however, developed more frequently in juvenile idiopathic arthritis-associated uveitis (38%) compared with other forms of uveitis (11%) and more frequently in children with uveitis who were ANA positive (42%) than in those who were ANA negative (6%). Elevated intraocular pressure occurred in two thirds of all children within the first 2 years after the diagnosis of uveitis. Except for patients with juvenile idiopathic arthritis-associated uveitis, periocular steroid injections represented an additional risk factor for secondary glaucoma, but this risk was limited to the early phase of the disease process.
CONCLUSIONS: In children with uveitis in this series, juvenile idiopathic arthritis-associated uveitis and ANA-positive uveitis without evidence of arthritis are the most important risk factors for developing secondary glaucoma.",17,2006-May-1

We studied the clinical effects of the immunosuppressive agent FK506 in patients with noninfectious uveitis.
METHODS: This study was designed as a multicenter open clinical trial in Japan. Sixteen patients with noninfectious uveitis who had visited the Uveitis Survey Clinic of the Yokohama City University Hospital were given FK506. Eight had Behçet's disease; five, Vogt-Koyanagi-Harada syndrome; one, sympathetic ophthalmia; one, retinal vasculitis; and one, sarcoidosis. In patients with Behçet's disease, ocular attack score before and after therapy was compared to judge clinical status. For the other diseases, the ocular inflammatory symptoms were observed after the initiation of FK506 treatment. All patients underwent blood and urine examinations, electrocardiography, and chest x-rays before and after FK506 treatment.
RESULTS: Of the patients with Behçet's disease, five improved, one remained unchanged, one deteriorated, and the status of one could not be determined. Of the patients with Vogt-Koyanagi-Harada syndrome, four improved, and one remained unchanged. The patient with sympathetic ophthalmia improved, the patient with retinal vasculitis remained unchanged, and the status of the patient with sarcoidosis could not be determined. Major adverse effects were sensations of warmth, hypomagnesemia, renal dysfunction, glucose intolerance, nausea, vomiting, and disorders of the central nervous system. All adverse effects disappeared or improved when FK506 was stopped or when the dosage was decreased. Renal dysfunction and glucose intolerance appeared when the blood level of FK506 was high.
CONCLUSIONS: FK506 was effective in patients with uveitis, but it is important to monitor the occurrence of adverse effects.",17,1994-Dec-15

Vogt-Koyanagi-Harada disease (VKH) is a multisystem autoimmune disorder principally affecting pigmented tissues in the ocular, auditory, integumentary and central nervous systems. Patients are typically 20 to 50 years old and have no history of either surgical or accidental ocular trauma. Pigmented races are more commonly affected. Depending on revised diagnostic criteria, the disease is classified as complete, incomplete or probable based on the presence of extraocular findings (neurological, auditory and integumentary). The clinical course of VKH is divided into four phases: prodromal (mimics a viral infection), uveitic (bilateral diffuse uveitis with papillitis and exudative retinal detachment), convalescent (tissue depigmentation), and chronic recurrent (recurrent uveitis and ocular complications). The pathogenesis of VKH is thought to be related to an aberrant T cell-mediated immune response directed against self-antigens found on melanocytes. VKH has been linked to human leukocyte antigen DR4 (HLA-DR4) and HLA-Dw53, with strongest associated risk for HLA-DRB1*0405 haplotype. The diagnosis of VKH is clinical, and differential includes sympathetic ophthalmia, sarcoidosis, primary intraocular B-cell lymphoma, posterior scleritis, and uveal effusion syndrome. Treatment is typically initiated with high-dose oral corticosteroids, but other immunomondulatory agents (most oftentimes cyclosporine) may be needed for non-responsive patients or when corticosteroid side-effects are not tolerated. Visual prognosis is generally good with prompt diagnosis and aggressive immunomodulatory treatment.",17,2005-1-1

To investigate the relationships between peripheral vasculitis, ischemia, and vascular leakage in uveitis using ultra-widefield fluorescein angiography (FA).
DESIGN: Cross-sectional, consecutive case series.
METHODS: Consecutive ultra-widefield FA images were collected from 82 uveitis patients (82 eyes) in a single center. The extent of peripheral vasculitis, capillary nonperfusion, and vessel leakage were quantified. Parameters included: (1) foveal avascular zone area and macular leakage, (2) peripheral diffuse capillary leakage and ischemia, (3) peripheral vasculitis, and (4) leakage from neovascularization. Central macular thickness measurements were derived with optical coherence tomography. Main outcome measures were correlations between central and peripheral fluorangiographic changes as well as associations between visual function, ultra-widefield FA-derived metrics, and central macular thickness.
RESULTS: Although central leakage was associated with peripheral leakage (r = 0.553, P = .001), there was no association between foveal avascular zone size and peripheral ischemia (r = 0.114, P = .324), regardless of the underlying uveitic diagnosis. Peripheral ischemia was, however, correlated to neovascularization-related leakage (r = 0.462, P = .001) and focal vasculitis (r = 0.441, P = .001). Stepwise multiple regression analysis revealed that a poor visual acuity was independently associated with foveal avascular zone size and central macular thickness (R(2)-adjusted = 0.45, P = .001).
CONCLUSIONS: We present a large cohort of patients with uveitis imaged with ultra-widefield FA and further describe novel methods for quantification of peripheral vascular pathology, in an attempt to identify visually significant parameters. Although we observed that relationships exist between peripheral vessel leakage, vasculitis, and ischemia, it was only macular ischemia and increased macular thickness that were independently associated with a reduced visual acuity.",17,2015-Jun-1

To describe the prevalence of extra-articular manifestations-enthesitis, dactylitis, nail disease, uveitis and IBD-in PsA, and their impact on longitudinal disease outcomes.
METHODS: We searched Medline, PubMed, Scopus and Web of Science using a predefined protocol in accordance with Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) guidelines. Studies using imaging to define extra-articular manifestations (EAMs) were excluded. Where possible, we performed meta-analyses of prevalence estimates, reported as percentages (95% CI). Heterogeneity (I2 statistic) was examined according to study characteristics.
RESULTS: We identified 65 studies amounting to a total of 163 299 PsA patients. Enthesitis was assessed in 29 studies with an average prevalence of 30% (95% CI: 24%, 38%). Dactylitis was reported in 35 studies with an average prevalence of 25% (95% CI: 20%, 31%). Nail disease was present in 60% (95% CI: 52%, 68%) across 26 studies, but definitions were often unclear. Uveitis (3.2%; 95% CI: 1.9%, 5.3%) and IBD (3.3%; 95% CI: 1.5%, 7.1%) were less common. Heterogeneity was high (>95%) in all meta-analyses, but could not be explained by study characteristics. No studies examined the impact of EAMs on longitudinal disease outcomes, except that dactylitis increases radiographic progression.
CONCLUSION: Enthesitis, dactylitis and nail disease are highly prevalent in PsA, but not uveitis and IBD. EAM patterns differ from axial SpA despite their shared disease mechanisms, which may help further understand differences between spondyloarthritides. More studies are needed on the impact of EAMs on disease outcomes such as response to treatment.",17,2020-Sep-01

To report cases of Blau syndrome with a CARD15/Nod2 mutation.
DESIGN: Observational and interventional case report.
PARTICIPANTS: A 10-year-old Japanese boy (proband) was seen with secondary angle-closure glaucoma (iris bombe), uveitis, skin rashes, and camptodactyly. His sister had posterior synechia and camptodactyly. She had iritis in both eyes during the follow-up period. Both eyes of the father were phthisical because of granulomatous uveitis and secondary glaucoma. The father also had camptodactyly.
METHODS: Surgery was performed to release the iris bombe. Ocular inflammation was treated by topical and systemic steroids. Biopsy specimens from the skin rash and from the iris (from iridectomy) were obtained from the proband. Genetic analyses were performed on the proband, his sister, and their mother for a CARD15/Nod2 mutation.
MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Clinical features, pathologic findings of the skin and iris specimens, and genetic analysis of the CARD15/Nod2 gene.
RESULTS: Phacoemulsification, intraocular lens implantation, and peripheral iridectomy released the iris bombe. The biopsy specimen from the skin rash showed noncaseating, granulomatous infiltration with epithelioid cells and lymphocytes. The iridectomy specimen showed nonspecific inflammation. Systemic and topical steroid therapy partly reduced the ocular inflammation. Genetic analyses showed that the proband and his sister had an R334W mutation in the CARD15/Nod2 gene, but their mother was of the wild type.
CONCLUSIONS: Blau syndrome should be considered in the differential diagnosis of childhood uveitis. Genetic analysis of the CARD15/Nod2 gene is helpful in the diagnosis.",17,2003-Oct-1

A major limitation of most animal models of autoimmune diseases is that they do not reproduce the chronic or relapsing-remitting pattern characteristic of many human autoimmune diseases. This problem has been overcome in our rat models of experimentally induced monophasic or relapsing-remitting autoimmune uveitis (EAU), which depend on the inducing antigen peptides from retinal S-Antigen (monophasic EAU) or interphotoreceptor retinoid-binding protein (relapsing EAU). These models enable us to compare autoreactive and regulatory T cell populations. Intraocular, but not peripheral T cells differ in their cytokine profiles (IFN-γ, IL-17 and IL-10) at distinct time points during monophasic or relapsing EAU. Only intraocular T cells concomitantly produced IFN-γ, IL-17 and/or IL-10. Monophasic EAU presented rising numbers of cells expressing IFN-γ and IL-17 (Th1/Th17) and cells expressing IL-10 or Foxp3. During relapsing uveitis an increase of intraocular IFN-γ+ cells and a concomitant decrease of IL-17+ cells was detected, while IL-10+ populations remained stable. Foxp3+ cells and cells expressing IL-10, even in combination with IFN-γ or IL-17, increased during the resolution of monophasic EAU, suggesting a regulatory role for these T cells. In general, cells producing multiple cytokines increased in monophasic and decreased in relapsing EAU. The distinct appearance of certain intraocular populations with characteristics of regulatory cells points to a differential influence of the ocular environment on T cells that induce acute and monophasic or relapsing disease. Here we provide evidence that different autoantigens can elicit distinct and differently regulated immune responses. IFN-γ, but not IL-17 seems to be the key player in relapsing-remitting uveitis, as shown by increased, synchronized relapses after intraocular application of IFN-γ. We demonstrated dynamic changes of the cytokine pattern during monophasic and relapsing-remitting disease with strongly increasing IL-10 expression in intraocular T cells during monophasic uveitis.",17,2012-1-1

To quantitatively analyze in vivo morphology of subfoveal choroid during an acute attack of Behçet uveitis.
METHODS: In this prospective study, 28 patients with Behçet uveitis of ≤4-year duration, and 28 control subjects underwent enhanced depth imaging optical coherence tomography. A novel custom software was used to calculate choroidal stroma-to-choroidal vessel lumen ratio. Subfoveal choroidal thickness was measured at fovea and 750 μm nasal, temporal, superior, and inferior to fovea. Patients underwent fluorescein angiography and indocyanine green angiography. Receiver operating characteristic curve and area under the curve were computed for central foveal thickness. The eye with a higher Behçet disease ocular attack score 24 was studied. The main outcome measures were choroidal stroma-to-choroidal vessel lumen ratio and choroidal thickness.
RESULTS: The mean total Behçet disease ocular attack score 24, fluorescein angiography, and indocyanine green angiography scores were 7.42 ± 4.10, 17.42 ± 6.03, and 0.66 ± 0.73, respectively. Choroidal stroma-to-choroidal vessel lumen ratio was significantly higher in patients (0.413 ± 0.056 vs. 0.351 ± 0.063, P = 0.003). There were no significant differences in subfoveal choroidal thickness between patients and control subjects. Choroidal stroma-to-choroidal vessel lumen ratio correlated with retinal vascular staining and leakage score of fluorescein angiography (r = 0.300, P = 0.036). Central foveal thickness was significantly increased in patients (352.750 ± 107.134 μm vs. 263.500 ± 20.819 μm, P < 0.001). Central foveal thickness showed significant correlations with logarithm of minimum angle of resolution vision, Behçet disease ocular attack score 24, total fluorescein angiography score, retinal vascular staining and/or leakage and capillary leakage scores of fluorescein angiography, and total indocyanine green angiography score. At 275 μm cutoff, diagnostic sensitivity and specificity of central foveal thickness for acute Behçet uveitis were 89% and 72%, respectively (area under the curve = 0.902; 95% CI = 0.826-0.978, P < 0.001).
CONCLUSION: There was choroidal stromal expansion which was not associated with thickening of the choroid. Central foveal thickness may be used as a noninvasive measure to assess inflammatory activity in early Behçet uveitis.",17,2018-Apr-1

Idiopathic disease is the most frequent diagnosis in a uveitis clinic. The need to distinguish sarcoidosis from idiopathic uveitis is controversial. However, cardiac involvement in sarcoidosis can be life-threatening.
OBJECTIVE: To report a series of patients with uveitis and cardiac sarcoidosis to illustrate the importance of categorizing the causes of uveitis.
DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: This retrospective observational case series reviewed the medical records of 249 patients with uveitis who were referred to the Casey Eye Institute between July 1, 2008, and February 28, 2017.
MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: We describe patients who initially received a diagnosis of idiopathic uveitis but subsequently received a diagnosis of sarcoidosis. Clinical data, including ophthalmologic findings, were collected. We summarized the number of patients who initially presented with idiopathic uveitis, the number of patients who recived a classification of idiopathic uveitis after evaluation, the number of patients who underwent chest computed tomography or an electrocardiogram, and the number of patients with ocular sarcoidosis.
RESULTS: Of 33 patients with sarcoidosis, 21 (63.6%) were women and the mean (SD) age was 53.5 (13.8) years. Of 249 patients, the referring diagnosis was idiopathic uveitis for 179 (72%). After history, examination, and laboratory testing, 127 (51%) were still considered to have idiopathic disease. Fifty-three of the 179 patients (30%) with idiopathic disease underwent chest computed tomography scanning. A diagnosis of presumed sarcoidosis, usually on the basis of a chest computed tomography scan, was made in 19 patients (36.2%). As 14 patients (5.6%) were previously known to have sarcoidosis, 33 patients (13.3%) were evaluated with definite or presumed ocular sarcoidosis. We obtained electrocardiograms as a screen for cardiac sarcoidosis on 14 (42.4%) of these patients. Nine patients with abnormal electrocardiogram results were referred to cardiologists. Four of the 19 patients (21.1%) who were referred for idiopathic uveitis but subsequently received a diagnosis of presumed sarcoidosis were found to have episodes of ventricular tachycardia that required implantable cardiac defibrillators. Distinguishing ocular sarcoidosis from idiopathic uveitis had potentially life-saving implications for these patients.
CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: The present case series shows the potential utility of distinguishing sarcoidosis-associated uveitis from idiopathic uveitis. We suggest that patients older than 40 years with a history of idiopathic uveitis be evaluated with chest computed tomography and an electrocardiogram if sarcoidosis is suggested on ophthalmic examination.",17,2018-Feb-01

Posner-Schlossman-Syndrome (PSS) is clinically characterized by acute, recurrent, mild, unilateral uveitis anterior accompanied by elevated intraocular pressure (IOP). Fuchs´ Uveitis (FU) is a chronic, low-grade-inflammatory disorder, involving anterior uvea and vitreous. The clinical findings show remarkable similarities as well as differences. In our study, we determine the composition of immune mediators in aqueous humor of patients with PSS and FU and evaluate if immune mediators play a crucial role in specific viral intraocular inflammation and IOP rises. Aqueous humor samples from 81 uveitis patients (= eyes) presenting with either PSS or FU were collected at one time point. Local intraocular antibody synthesis to rubella virus was confirmed in 65 patients, whereas 16 were tested positively for human cytomegalovirus. Thirteen patients with PSS and 10 patients with FU were treated with glaucoma medications. Additionally, 11 cataract patients acted as control group. Immune mediator concentrations were measured by Bio-Plex Pro assay. We observed in both PSS (IFN-γ: 174.9 pg/mL; TNF-α: 25.1 pg/mL) and FU (IFN-γ: 25.4 pg/mL; TNF-α: 27.2 pg/mL) groups a significantly increased level of T-helper 1 immune mediators compared to controls (IFN-γ, TNF-α: 0 pg/mL) [median]. Notably, PSS patients (IL-1RA: 73.4 pg/mL; IL-8: 199.4 pg/mL; IL-10: 33.4 pg/mL; IP-10: 126350 pg/mL) showed a stronger and more active ocular inflammatory response, than FU patients (IL-1RA: 4.3 pg/mL; IL-8: 72.4 pg/mL; IL-10: 1.6 pg/mL; IP-10: 57400 pg/mL). Furthermore, a negative correlation between mediators and IOP was seen in the PSS group, potentially caused by acetazolamide-treatment. Our findings show that immune mediators play a crucial role in specific viral intraocular inflammation and influence IOP levels. Remarkable similarities but also significant differences of immune mediator concentrations are apparent in PSS compared to FU. High concentrations of IL-1RA, IL-8, IL-10, and IP-10 correlate with active inflammation in PSS, while FU may trigger chronic inflammation. Our data also substantiated a very similar composition of cytokines in those patients from the PSS group suffering from ocular hypertension and thus offers a potential explanation model for a negative correlation between mediators and IOP.",17,2018-1-1

Brucellosis has unusual clinical manifestations. Ocular involvement caused by brucellosis remains poorly recognized in areas in which brucellosis is endemic.
METHODS: A prospective study was performed to evaluate patients attending the Instituto de Medicina Tropical ""Alexander von Humboldt"" and the Hospital Nacional Cayetano Heredia (Lima, Peru) from January 1980 through December 2005 who received a diagnosis of brucellosis with ocular involvement. Diagnosis was made on the basis of clinical findings as well as agglutinations and/or culture positive for Brucella melitensis.
RESULTS: During a period of 26 years, 1551 patients with brucellosis were seen, including 52 patients with ocular brucellosis. We found that 7 (0.7%) of 965 patients with acute brucellosis and 45 (7.9%) of 570 patients with chronic brucellosis had ocular brucellosis (P<.001). In 16 patients with brucellosis, the disease stage was unclassified. The most frequent ocular presentation was uveitis, which was found in 43 (82.7%) of the 52 patients with ocular brucellosis. Posterior uveitis was the most frequent uveal syndrome (21 cases; 45.7%). Patients with panuveitis had the worst visual prognosis: 8 of 9 patients with panuveitis were legally blind, including 5 patients with no light perception.
CONCLUSIONS: Brucellosis may involve the eye and can lead to serious complications. In patients with brucellosis, early ophthalmologic evaluation can lead to prompt treatment and might prevent blindness from severe ocular damage.",17,2008-May-01

The XEN-45 implant, a hydrophilic collagen implant which drains aqueous to the subconjunctival space, has not been investigated in the context of uveitic glaucoma.
BACKGROUND: To determine the safety and efficacy of the XEN-45 collagen implant in eyes with uveitic glaucoma.
DESIGN: Exploratory prospective case series.
PARTICIPANTS: patients with medically uncontrolled uveitic glaucoma.
METHODS: Twenty-four consecutive patients (mean age ± standard deviation [SD] = 45.3 ± 18.1 years) were implanted with the XEN-45 implant.
MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: The primary outcome measure was intraocular pressure (IOP) reduction at 12 months as compared to baseline. Secondary outcome measures included ocular hypotensive medication use at 12 months, the requirement for further glaucoma surgery and failure. Intraoperative and postoperative complications were documented.
RESULTS: The baseline mean ± SD IOP was 30.5 ± 9.8 mmHg and the mean ± SD number of glaucoma medications required was 3.3 ± 0.8. In 20 eyes (83.3%) in whom conventional glaucoma surgery was originally perceived to be inevitable, further surgery was not required after XEN-45 implantation. The mean IOP was reduced by 60.2% from baseline to 12.2 ± 3.1 mmHg and mean medication usage was reduced to 0.4 ± 0.9 at 12 months (both P < 0.001). One patient had hypotony persisting beyond 2 months that required surgical revision and one patient developed blebitis. The 12-month cumulative Kaplan-Meier survival probability was 79.2%.
CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: The XEN-45 implant is effective for the treatment of patients with medically uncontrolled uveitic glaucoma. Potentially sight-threatening complications, including bleb-related ocular infection and persistent hypotony, may occur.",17,2018-May-1

To measure antibody titers against Leptospira interrogans in serum and vitreous humor and determine the prevalence of L interrogans in vitreous humor of horses with recurrent uveitis.
DESIGN: Cross-sectional study.
ANIMALS: 242 horses (270 eyes) with recurrent uveitis undergoing vitrectomy and 39 control horses (54 eyes) without any history or clinical signs of recurrent uveitis undergoing euthanasia or enucleation for unrelated reasons.
PROCEDURE: Serum and vitreous humor were tested for antibodies against 13 serovars of L interrogans. Vitreous humor was submitted for leptospiral culture; isolates were typed to the serogroup level.
RESULTS: Leptospira interrogans was isolated from vitreous humor from 120/229 (52%) horses (126/252 [50%] eyes) with recurrent uveitis but was not isolated from vitreous humor from 36 eyes of 21 control horses. Duration of recurrent uveitis was > or = 1 year for 45 of the 120 (38%) horses from which the organism was isolated. Geometric mean antibody titers against L interrogans in the vitreous humor and serum of horses with recurrent uveitis were 1:1,332 and 1:186, respectively. Only 91 of 120 (76%) horses from which the organism was isolated had a 4-fold or greater difference between serum and vitreous humor antibody titers.
CONCLUSIONS AND CLINICAL RELEVANCE: Results suggest that persistent ocular infection with L interrogans is common in horses with recurrent uveitis. A 4-fold increase in vitreous humor versus serum antibody titers may not be a sensitive test for the diagnosis of L interrogans-induced recurrent uveitis. We hypothesize that the immune component of recurrent uveitis can be directly induced and maintained by persistent infection of the eye with L interrogans.",17,2001-Sep-15

To identify clinical features and prognostic factors in patients with Fuchs' uveitis (FU). All patients diagnosed with FU at King Khaled Eye Specialist Hospital between 1983 and 2005 were reviewed. Data collected included age, gender, initial and final visual acuities, clinical findings at presentation and during follow-up visits, interval between onset of symptoms and presentation to our institute, ocular complications, details of surgical procedures, and duration of follow-up. One hundred and sixty-six patients (174 eyes) were identified. There were 92 (55.4%) males and 74 (44.6%) females with a mean age of 35.2 ± 10.5 years (range 10-70 years). The mean follow-up period was 57.3 ± 96.7 months (range 1-146 months). The most common presenting symptom was decreased vision (79.9%). Characteristic keratic precipitates (90.2%), diffuse iris stromal atrophy (100%), heterochronmia (13.9%), iris nodules (13.8%), vitreous opacity (50%) (not including sparse vitreous infiltration), cataract (85.6%) and glaucoma (27.6%) were the major clinical findings. The following factors were significantly associated with final visual acuity of 20/40 or better by univariate analysis: shorter interval between onset of symptoms and presentation (p = 0.0087), good initial visual acuity of 20/40 or better (p = 0.0356), absence of glaucoma at presentation (p = 0.0264), no glaucoma surgery (p = 0.0035), and absence of glaucoma and cataract at last visit (p = 0.0126). Logistic regression analysis revealed that final visual acuity of 20/40 or better was negatively correlated with a longer interval between onset of symptoms and presentation (odds ratio (OD) 0.201; 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.0734-0.548), and glaucoma surgical intervention (OD 0.247; 95% CI 0.0796-0.766). Initial visual acuity of 20/40 or better was positively associated with final visual acuity of 20/40 or better (OD 3.34; 95% CI 1.13-9.90). A shorter interval between onset of symptoms and presentation to our institute, better initial visual acuity, and no glaucoma surgery were significantly associated with better final visual acuity.",17,2010-Oct-1

Aqueous humour samples from untreated patients with acute anterior uveitis were found to contain substantial amounts of prostaglandin-like activity. Little activity was found in aqueous from patients treated with steroids, and none (<2 ng/ml) was detected in aqueous from the uninflamed eyes of patients with cataract. Alkaline hydrolysis of the samples from inflamed eyes suggested the presence of both E and F prostaglandin-like activity. These results show that prostaglandins may be involved in acute anterior uveitis.",17,1972-Aug-19

To evaluate golimumab (GOL) efficacy in the management of Behçet's disease (BD)-related uveitis.
METHODS: We retrospectively collected data from 5 patients (8 eyes) with at least two recent relapses of uveitis, treated with GOL at the standard dose of 50 mg every 4 weeks.
RESULTS: A complete control of intraocular inflammation was observed in 7/8 eyes (87.5%) at 12-month follow-up. The number of relapses 12 months before and after GOL initiation was 11 and 1, respectively. At baseline, four eyes had active retinal vasculitis (RV). At 3-month follow-up evaluation RV resolved in all eyes. Mean Best Corrected Visual Acuity was 6.93 ± 4.34 at baseline and 7.32 ± 3.87 at 12-months follow-up.
CONCLUSION: We confirm GOL efficacy in reducing intraocular inflammation in BD, both in term of reduction in the number of uveitis relapses and in achieving a prompt resolution of active RV.",17,2019-1-1

To investigate the involvement of the chemokines CXCL10/IP-10, CXCL11/I-TAC, CXCL8/1L-8, CXCL6/GCP-2, CCL3/MIP-1alpha, and CCL18/PARC, and gelatinases A and B in uveitis.
DESIGN: Prospective, experimental, case-control study.
METHODS: Aqueous humor samples from 30 patients with active uveitis, and 14 control patients and paired serum samples were assayed for chemokines with specific enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays (ELISAs) and for gelatinase levels by quantitative zymography.
RESULTS: In control AH, none of the chemokines was detected. Gelatinase A was detected in all samples, and gelatinase B was detected in only one sample. In patients with uveitis, IP-10 was detected in all AH samples, whereas I-TAC, IL-8, GCP-2, MIP-1alpha, and PARC were detected in three, 16, six, two, and 12 samples, respectively. IP-10 levels were significantly higher in AH samples than those of serum (P =.006). Gelatinase A was detected in 29 AH samples and gelatinase B was detected in 26 samples. Gelatinase A levels were significantly higher in AH samples from patients than those of controls (P <.0001). In 11 AH samples, gelatinase B was detected in complex with lipocalin (NGAL). Disease activity correlated significantly with the levels of IP-10 (r =.627; P <.0001), gelatinase A (r =.508; P =.002), gelatinase B (r =.685; P <.0001), and NGAL-gelatinase B complex (r =.595; P <.0001).

To prospectively assess the efficiency of a standardized diagnostic approach, compared to an open strategy, for the etiologic diagnosis of uveitis.
DESIGN: Noninferiority, prospective, multicenter, clustered randomized controlled trial.
METHODS: Consecutive patients with uveitis, who visited 1 of the participating departments of ophthalmology, were included. In the standardized group, all patients had a minimal evaluation regardless of the type of uveitis (complete blood count, erythrocyte sedimentation rate, C-reactive protein, tuberculin skin test, syphilis serology, and chest radiograph) followed by more complex investigations according to ophthalmologic findings. In the open group, the ophthalmologist could order any type of investigation. Main outcome was the percentage of etiologic diagnoses at 6 months.
RESULTS: Nine hundred and three patients with uveitis were included from January 2010 to May 2013 and the per-protocol population comprised 676 patients (open 373; standardized 303). Mean age at diagnosis was 46 years. Anatomic distribution of uveitis was as follows: anterior (60.8% and 72.3%, P = .0017), intermediate (11.7% and 12.3%, P = .8028), posterior (17.8% and 8.2%, P = .0004), and panuveitis (15.3% and 15.2%, P = .9596). An etiologic diagnosis was established in 54.4% of cases in the open group and 49.5% in the standardized group (P = .2029). The difference between both strategies (standardized minus open) was -4.9% (95% CI [-12.5%; 2.6%]). There were more investigations in the open group than in the standardized group (5371 vs 3759, P < .0001).
CONCLUSION: The standardized strategy appears to be an efficient diagnostic approach for the etiologic diagnosis of uveitis, although its noninferiority cannot be proved.",17,2017-Jun-1

The incidence of new infection with syphilis is increasing, particularly in men who have sex with men, with HIV co-infection common. There has been a corresponding increase in ophthalmic manifestations that can be varied in presentation.
METHODS: Thirteen consecutive patients with syphilitic uveitis presenting to two ophthalmic departments in Sydney are described.
RESULTS: Twelve patients were male, of whom 10 were homosexual and six HIV-positive. Peripheral retinitis with panuveitis was the commonest ophthalmic presentation (n = 7, 54%), and six cases were initially treated with vitreous tap and intravitreal foscarnet as a precaution in case of viral retinitis. Retinitis was present in six of six (100%) HIV-positive and only one of seven (14%) HIV-negative patients (χ² 10.6, P < 0.01). Other ophthalmic presentations included anterior uveitis, vitritis, multifocal choroiditis, scleritis and papillitis. All patients responded to 10-14 days' intravenous penicillin with good final visual outcomes (6/12 or better in all eyes).
CONCLUSIONS: This case series reinforces the importance of considering syphilis in the differential diagnosis of many ocular presentations, but in particular retinitis. Retinitis appears to be the predominant presentation in HIV-infected individuals, suggesting that HIV infection may somehow modulate the disease.",17,2010-Dec-1

Gene and protein expression profiles of iris biopsies, aqueous humor (AqH), and sera in patients with juvenile idiopathic arthritis-associated uveitis (JIAU) in comparison to control patients with primary open-angle glaucoma (POAG) and HLA-B27-positive acute anterior uveitis (AAU) were investigated. Via RNA Sequencing (RNA-Seq) and mass spectrometry-based protein expression analyses 136 genes and 56 proteins could be identified as being significantly differentially expressed (DE) between the JIAU and POAG group. Gene expression of different immunoglobulin (Ig) components as well as of the B cell-associated factors ID3, ID1, and EBF1 was significantly upregulated in the JIAU group as compared to POAG patients. qRT-PCR analysis showed a significantly higher gene expression of the B cell-related genes CD19, CD20, CD27, CD138, and MZB1 in the JIAU group. At the protein level, a significantly higher expression of Ig components in JIAU than in POAG was confirmed. The B cell-associated protein MZB1 showed a higher expression in JIAU patients than in POAG which was confirmed by western blot analysis. Using bead-based immunoassay analysis we were able to detect a significantly higher concentration of the B cell-activating and survival factors BAFF, APRIL, and IL-6 in the AqH of JIAU and AAU patients than in POAG patients. The intraocularly upregulated B cell-specific genes and proteins in iris tissue suggest that B cells participate in the immunopathology of JIAU. The intracameral environment in JIAU may facilitate local effector and survival functions of B cells, leading to disease course typical for anterior uveitis.",17,2019-Jun-1

To describe chorioretinal lesions in pediatric uveitis that are associated strongly with the HLA-DR, DQ class II type associated with tubulointerstitial nephritis and uveitis (TINU).
DESIGN: Retrospective, observational case series.
SETTING: University-based clinic.
PATIENT POPULATION: Fifteen consecutive patients with onset of bilateral panuveitis at less than 16 years of age who were seen between September 2004 and October 2012 and 6 pediatric patients with confirmed TINU.
OBSERVATION PROCEDURE: HLA-DR, DQ class II DNA typing.
MAIN OUTCOME MEASURE: Detection of the HLA-DRB1*01 and HLA-DQB1*05 risk alleles for TINU.
RESULTS: Fourteen (93%) of the 15 patients with otherwise unexplained pediatric panuveitis typed HLA-DRB1*01-HLA-DQB1*05. Eleven (73.3%) of 15 patients had bilateral sharply demarcated, usually inferior, 200- to 300-μm spots of chorioretinal atrophy, and 4 (27.7%) of 15 patients had bilateral clusters of 500- to 750-μm poorly defined orange choroidal lesions without overlying atrophy of the retinal pigment epithelium. None had interstitial nephritis. Four of the 6 definite TINU cases had class II typing and TINU risk alleles; all 6 had bilateral panuveitis. The frequency of risk alleles was statistically higher in those with pediatric panuveitis than in the North American population and in nonpanuveitis pediatric uveitis patients assumed to have the North American HLA distribution (P < .0001, Fischer exact test). Positive likelihood ratios were 9.92 to 5.18, depending on assumptions regarding pretest probability of disease.
CONCLUSIONS: Recognition of characteristic chorioretinal lesions in otherwise unexplained pediatric panuveitis, supported by selective HLA class II DNA typing, is useful in narrowing diagnostic possibilities and directing further evaluations. Panuveitis is underappreciated as a manifestation of TINU.",17,2014-Mar-1

Infliximab, an anti-tumor necrosis factor-alpha antibody, has been reported to have excellent efficacy for refractory uveoretinitis in Behçet's disease (RUBD), and was approved for this indication in Japan. However, the long-term safety profile and efficacy in real-world clinical settings in patients with RUBD have not been fully clarified. The BRIGHT study, a prospective, large-scale, long-term postmarketing surveillance (PMS) study, was conducted to investigate the long-term safety and efficacy of infliximab in Japanese patients with RUBD.
METHODS: All patients with RUBD who started infliximab treatment between January 2007 and January 2010 were enrolled. Safety was evaluated every 6 months for up to 24 months after initiation of therapy in 656 patients, and efficacy was evaluated in 650 patients. Patient characteristics were compared using the chi-square or Fisher's exact test. The frequency of ocular attacks before and after infliximab treatment was compared using the Wilcoxon signed-rank test. Independent associated factors for safety or efficacy were identified using multiple logistic regression analysis. A two-sided p value <0.05 was considered significant.
RESULTS: Among the 656 patients evaluated for safety, 555 (84.6%) completed the 24-month study period. The incidence of adverse drug reactions (ADRs) and serious ADRs were 32.32% and 6.10%, respectively, and the safety profile was comparable to that of Japanese PMS of infliximab for other diseases. The most common ADRs and serious ADRs were infections (11.89% and 3.66%). Tuberculosis was reported in two patients, and Pneumocystis jirovecii in one. Identified independent associated factors for infections were comorbid respiratory disease, history of allergic disease, and concomitant use of glucocorticoids. Although infusion reactions were observed in 11.13% of patients, most were non-serious. The response rate at 24 months by physician global assessment was 80.7%. Median frequency of ocular attacks per 6 months significantly decreased compared with that before infliximab treatment (2.0 to 0.0), and corrected visual acuity was maintained during the study.
CONCLUSIONS: Infliximab treatment had good tolerability and efficacy in Japanese patients with RUBD in this large-scale, long-term PMS. Infliximab treatment seemed to be a good treatment option for RUBD in real-world clinical settings.

Uveitis in juvenile idiopathic arthritis (JIAU) is frequently associated with the development of complications and visual loss. Topical corticosteroids are the first line therapy, and disease modifying anti-rheumatic drugs (DMARDs) are commonly used. However, treatment has not been standardized.
METHODS: Interdisciplinary guideline were developed with representatives from the German Ophthalmological Society, Society for Paediatric Rheumatology, Professional Association of Ophthalmologists, German Society for Rheumatology, parents' group, moderated by the Association of the Scientific Medical Societies in Germany. A systematic literature analysis in MEDLINE was performed, evidence and recommendations were graded, an algorithm for anti-inflammatory treatment and final statements were discussed in a consensus meeting (Nominal Group Technique), a preliminary draft was fine-tuned and discussed thereafter by all participants (Delphi procedure).
RESULTS: Consensus was reached on recommendations, including a standardized treatment strategy according to uveitis severity in the individual patient. Thus, methotrexate shall be introduced for uveitis not responding to low-dose (≤ 2 applications/day) topical corticosteroids, and a TNFalpha antibody (preferably adalimumab) used, if uveitis inactivity is not achieved. In very severe active uveitis with uveitis-related deterioration of vision, systemic corticosteroids should be considered for bridging until DMARDs take effect. If TNFalpha antibodies fail to take effect or lose effect, another biological should be selected (tocilizumab, abatacept or rituximab). De-escalation of DMARDs should be preceded by a period of  ≥ 2 years of uveitis inactivity.
CONCLUSIONS: An interdisciplinary, evidence-based treatment guideline for JIAU is presented.",17,2019-Aug-1

The cytokines present in the aqueous humor and serum of C3H/HeN mice with endotoxin-induced acute anterior uveitis were analyzed, and the potential role of the cytokines in the pathogenesis of the disease was investigated.
METHODS: One hundred and eighty C3H/HeN mice were divided into an experimental group (n=150) and a control group (n=30). The mice in the experimental group were footpad-injected with 200 microg Vibro cholerae endotoxin (classical biotype, serotype Ogawa). The mice were then executed 4 h, 8 h, 16 h, 24 h, and 48 h after the injection of endotoxin. Aqueous humor and peripheral blood samples were collected using a microinjector. Ten samples were pooled together for analysis and centrifuged at 705x g, at 4 degrees C, for 3 min. The supernatant was collected and stored at -80 degrees C. The concentrations of tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-alpha), interleukin-1 (IL-1), interleukin-6 (IL-6), interleukin-10 (IL-10), and interferon-gamma (IFN-gamma) in the samples were measured using a Cytometric Bead Array (CBA).
RESULTS: Acute anterior uveitis was successfully induced in C3H/HeN mice. At roughly 16 h post-injection, the concentrations of both IL-1 and IL-6 reached peak levels, and were significantly different from the control group (p=0.001 and p=0.001, respectively). At 24 h post-injection, the concentrations of IFN-gamma and IL-10 in the aqueous humor reached peak levels, and were significantly different from the control group (p=0.022 and p=0.003). The concentrations of IFN-gamma in serum at 4 and 24 hours were significantly different from the control group (p=0.033 and p=0.032). The concentration of IL-10 in serum, at 24 h post-injection, was also found to be significantly different from the control group (p=0.003). The cytokine expression levels in the aqueous humor were consistent with what would be expected during the process of inflammation.
CONCLUSIONS: Both IL-1 and IL-6 appear to play an important role in acute anterior uveitis; furthermore, the severity of inflammation may be associated with the dynamic balance of IFN-gamma and IL-10. Our results suggest that the cytokine network might be a useful therapeutic target in the treatment of acute anterior uveitis.",17,2010-Aug-21

To assess whether cigarette smoking is associated with the development of uveitis in a population-based setting.
DESIGN: Retrospective, population-based, case-control study.
PARTICIPANTS: Patients aged ≥ 18 years who were seen at a Kaiser Permanente Hawaii clinic between January 1, 2006, and December 31, 2007. Analysis included 100 confirmed incident uveitis cases, 522 randomly selected controls from the general Kaiser Hawaii population, and 528 randomly selected controls from the Kaiser Hawaii ophthalmology clinic.
METHODS: International Classification of Diseases, 9th revision (ICD-9), diagnosis codes were used to identify possible uveitis cases. A uveitis fellowship-trained ophthalmologist then conducted individual chart review to confirm case status. Multivariate logistic regression models were used to evaluate the association between smoking and uveitis, adjusting for age, sex, race, and socioeconomic status.
MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Development of uveitis.
RESULTS: Current smokers had a 1.63 (95% confidence interval [CI], 0.88-3.00; P = 0.12) and 2.33 (95% CI, 1.22-4.45; P = 0.01) times greater odds of developing uveitis compared with those who never smoked using the general and ophthalmology control groups, respectively. The association was even stronger with noninfectious uveitis, which yielded odds ratios of 2.10 (95% CI, 1.10-3.99; P = 0.02) and 2.96 (95% CI, 1.52-5.77; P = 0.001) using the general and ophthalmology control groups, respectively.
CONCLUSIONS: Cigarette smoking is significantly associated with new-onset uveitis within a population-based setting. The association was stronger for noninfectious uveitis. Given the well-established risks of smoking with regard to other inflammatory disorders, these results reaffirm the importance of encouraging patients to avoid or cease smoking.",17,2015-Jun-1

Equine recurrent uveitis (ERU) is a spontaneous disease characterised by repeated episodes of intraocular inflammation. The epidemiology of ERU has not been fully elucidated, but the condition appears to be much more common in horses than is recurrent uveitis in humans, especially in certain breeds and geographical regions. Both humans and horses show a similarly altered immune response and a marked autoimmune response as the primary disease pathophysiology. However, an inciting cause is not always clear. Potential inciting factors in horses include microbial agents such as Leptospira spp. Microbial factors and genetic predisposition to the disease may provide clues as to why the horse appears so susceptible to this disease. The aim of this review is to discuss the immunology and genetics of ERU, compare the disease in horses with autoimmune anterior uveitis in humans, and discuss potential reasons for the increased prevalence in the horse.",16,2015-Oct-1

To detect 
METHODS: Ten patients (10 eyes) with uveitis associated with sarcoidosis, who underwent vitrectomy to remove the epiretinal membrane were analysed. The patients were 70.4±7.6 (mean±SD) years of age, and the observation period from diagnosis of sarcoidosis until vitrectomy was 27.6±15.1 months. Histopathological examination of paraffin-embedded sections of the excised epiretinal membranes was conducted by H&E staining and immunohistochemical staining using PAB antibody, which is a monoclonal antibody against 
RESULTS: Granuloma in the epiretinal membrane was observed in 4 of 10 patients with sarcoidosis, and all the granulomas were positive for PAB. In one patient without granuloma in the epiretinal membrane, PAB immunoreactivity was found in inflammatory cells, presumably macrophages. No granuloma and no PAB immunoreactivity were detected in all control patients, except one with chronic uveitis in whom faint PAB immunoreactivity was detected in inflammatory cells.

To perform qualitative and quantitative analyses of retinal and choroidal morphology in patients with punctate inner choroidopathy (PIC) using enhanced depth imaging optical coherence tomography (EDI-OCT).
DESIGN: Cross-sectional, consecutive series.
PARTICIPANTS: A total of 2242 patients attending 2 tertiary referral uveitis clinics at Moorfields Eye Hospital were screened; 46 patients with PIC diagnosis were identified, and 35 eyes (35 patients) had clinically inactive PIC had EDI-OCT images that met the inclusion criteria.
METHODS: Punctate inner choroidopathy lesions were qualitatively assessed for retinal features, such as (1) focal elevation of the retinal pigment epithelium (RPE), (2) focal atrophy of the outer retina/RPE, and (3) presence of sub-RPE hyperreflective deposits and choroidal features: (a) presence of focal hyperreflective dots in the inner choroid and (b) focal thinning of the choroid adjacent to PIC lesions. Quantitative analyses of the retina, choroid, and choroidal sublayers were performed, and associations with clinical and demographic data were examined.
MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Prevalence of each lesion pattern and thickness of retinal and choroidal layers.
RESULTS: A total of 90 discrete PIC lesions were captured; 46.6% of PIC lesions consisted of focal atrophy of the outer retina and RPE; 34.4% consisted of sub-RPE hyperreflective deposits; and 18.8% consisted of localized RPE elevation with underlying hyporeflective space. Focal hyperreflective dots were seen in the inner choroid of 68.5% of patients, with 17.1% of eyes presenting focal choroidal thinning underlying PIC lesions. By excluding high myopes, patients with ""atypical"" PIC had reduced retinal thickness compared with patients with ""typical"" PIC (246.65±30.2 vs. 270.05±24.6 μm; P = 0.04), and greater disease duration was associated with decreases in retinal thickness (r = -0.53; P = 0.01). A significant correlation was observed between best-corrected visual acuity and foveal retinal thickness (r = -0.40; P = 0.03).
CONCLUSIONS: In a large series of patients with clinically inactive PIC, one fifth of the lesions analyzed revealed RPE elevation with underlying hyporeflective space, described before as a sign of activity and suggesting subclinical inflammation. Retinal thickness seems to be associated with disease type and duration of disease in non-highly myopic eyes. Improved visualization of the inner choroid using EDI-OCT may allow noninvasive assessment of inflammatory status.",16,2014-Sep-1

Behçet's disease (BD) is a multisystem inflammatory disorder of uncertain origin, although it remains defined within the spectrum of systemic immune-mediated vasculitic disorders and also represents a spectrum of putative autoimmune disease. Major symptoms include oral aphthous ulcers, genital ulcerations, skin lesions, and ocular lesions. Despite afflicting many systems, ocular complications of BD are some of the more devastating for the patient and their quality of life. Eye involvement, which affects 60-80 % of BD patients, is characterized in its more severe form by posterior or panuveitis including occlusive retinal vasculitis. While pathogenesis of BD remains complex, association with Class I MHC (HLA-B*51) predisposing to inflammation with engagement of the innate-immune system (neutrophils, NK cells), and perpetuated by the adaptive T cell responses against infectious- and/or auto-antigens. Despite the choice of conventional immunosuppressive therapies available, only recently with the advent of biologic therapy has visual prognosis and outcomes been substantially and favorably altered. For example, both interferon-α (IFN-α) and tumour necrosis factor (TNF)-α antagonists deliver promising results and for the first time improve prognosis. With IFN-α therapy, durable remissions of uveitis can be achieved and lead to drug-free remission. Similarly, anti-TNF therapy with infliximab is reported to be rapidly effective in inducing and maintaining remission. Most recently, rising evidence reports on the use of adalimumab, etanercept, and golimumab, while use of anti-interleukin (IL)-1 agents (anakinra, canakinumab, gevokizumab), IL-6 blockers (tocilizumab), and rituximab (depleting anti-CD20 antibody) is also increasing. The aim of this review is to provide evidence for the role of conventional therapies combined with evidence for advantages and disadvantages of biologic therapies in the treatment of ocular BD. Although randomized controlled trials remain sparse, evidence remains strong and enticing that biologic agents are invaluable for the treatment of sight-threatening Behçet's uveitis and makes it an exciting time for Behçet's specialists worldwide.",16,2014-Apr-1

To establish evidence-based recommendations regarding the use of anti-Tumor Necrosis Factor alpha (TNF-α) agents for managing uveitis patients.
METHODS: Medline was searched via OVID (1950 - October Week 3, 2011) using a Cochrane highly sensitive search (phases 1 and 2). Additional literature searches were also conducted incuding the following databases: the Cochrane, LILACS and the TRIP Database.
RESULTS: A total of 54 studies met all of the inclusion criteria and were included in this review. A different level of recommendation and evidence is assigned to each anti-TNF-α agent. The overall rate of reported side effects with anti-TNF-α agents for the treatment of uvetis which required discontinuation of therapy was 2.2% (26/1147 patients).
CONCLUSION: Based on the evidence gathered, infliximab and adalimumab seem to be effective in the management of immune-mediated uveitis. Further randomized studies evaluating the efficacy of these agents are warranted. It is the most common cause of inflammatory eye disease, with an estimated prevalence of 115 cases per 100,000 persons. Endogenous or associated with a systemic disease, noninfectious uveitis accounts for approximately 75% of total cases comprising of a heterogeneous group of inflammatory conditions responsible for about 10% of legal blindness in developed nations. Endogenous uveitides are thought to have an autoimmune component mediated by T lymphocytes specific to intraocular antigens that have failed to successfully pass basic processes designed to maintain self-tolerance.",16,2013-1-1

Cataract surgery in a patient with uveitis is more complex than senile cataract extraction, because it involves multiple considerations related to the cause of uveitis, prospects of visual rehabilitation, appropriate surgical timing and technique, and the type and material of the intraocular lens used. Establishing the diagnosis, thorough eye examination, careful patient selection and meticulous control of perioperative inflammation are key elements to a successful visual outcome. Our aims in this article are to review the literature on this subject over the past year and highlight the behavior of intraocular lenses of various biomaterials in the uveitic eye. In addition, we also reemphasize the idea of a model of zero tolerance to intraocular inflammation to minimize the incidence of irreversible damage to ocular structures essential to good vision.",16,2003-Feb-1

Encephalitozoon cuniculi is a microsporidium with a wide range of mammalian hosts. In rabbits it can be responsible for cataract and lens-induced uveitis (LIU). The aim of this study was to provide specific immunohistochemical demonstration and localization of E. cuniculi within the eye, in rabbits with LIU.
MATERIAL AND METHODS: Four rabbits were presented with a white mass in the eye and iris discoloration. Complete ophthalmic examinations were performed and a presumptive diagnosis of LIU was made in all cases. Initial therapy with a topical steroid, atropine and systemic enrofloxacin was instituted while serologic (IFA or ICA tests) and cytologic lab results were pending. The final outcome in all cases was enucleation. Routine histology and immunohistochemistry (ABC method) with an antiserum anti-Encephalitozoon cuniculi were performed.
RESULTS: Indirect immunofluorescence performed on one rabbit serum expressed a titer of 1 : 32; carbon immunoassay on the serum of the other three rabbits expressed a titer of 1 : 5120 in one, and a titer of 1 : 2560 in the other two cases. Histologically, an intraocular, locally extensive pyogranulomatous infiltration that partially filled the posterior chamber, encasing a wide anterior lens capsule break, was detected in all cases. Immunohistochemically, spores reacting with anti-Encephalitozoon cuniculi antiserum were present in all specimens, occasionally within macrophages and lens epithelial cells.
CONCLUSION: Detection of E. cuniculi in rabbits with phacoclastic uveitis has been investigated in the past with different methods. Based on our results, we suggest that immunohistochemistry should be regarded as a useful tool both for specific demonstration of E. cuniculi and for its localization within tissues.",16,2005-1-1

To use micro-ribonucleic acid (microRNA) profiles in the vitreous for differential diagnosis of primary vitreoretinal lymphoma and uveitis.
DESIGN: Prospective cross-sectional study.
METHODS: This prospective cross-sectional study included 17 diffuse large B-cell primary vitreoretinal lymphoma and 12 uveitis patients. The supernatant of ocular fluid was subjected to total RNA extraction, followed by complementary deoxyribonucleic acid (cDNA) synthesis. Selected samples (primary vitreoretinal lymphoma, n = 3; uveitis, n = 3) were arrayed by a real-time polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR)-based microRNA panel that detects 168 human mature microRNAs. The markers promising in distinct levels between uveitis and lymphoma were further tested for in all the other 23 samples by individual RT-PCR analysis.
RESULTS: Of 168 microRNAs in the array, 66.5% were detectable with consistent higher microRNA-484, microRNA-197, and microRNA-132 in the primary vitreoretinal lymphoma vitreous and higher microRNA-155, microRNA-200c, and microRNA-22* in the uveitic ocular fluids. The results were normalized by different combinations of 7 control microRNAs (microRNA-103, microRNA-191, microRNA-42-5p, microRNA-16, microRNA-425, microRNA-93, and microRNA-451). After optimization, normalization against microRNA-16 was equally as reliable as the average of the 7 control microRNAs. Individual assays of all samples supported the pattern yielded from the array analysis. But only microRNA-155 was significantly higher in the uveitic vitreous compared to that with lymphoma.
CONCLUSIONS: Mature microRNAs are detectable in ocular fluid samples. Primary vitreoretinal B-cell lymphoma and uveitis might be characterized by distinct microRNA signatures. Quantification of ocular microRNA-155 might be helpful in the differential diagnosis of these 2 diseases.",16,2014-Mar-1

Behçet's disease (BD) is a chronic multisystem inflammatory disorder associated to uveitis that may represent a serious sight-threatening condition. The purpose of the present study is to assess the effectiveness of adalimumab as new strategic therapeutic approach in patients affected by severe Behçet's uveitis.
METHODS: Clinical data from twelve selected patients (22 eyes) were retrospectively analysed. All patients received 40 mg of adalimumab subcutaneously, once every 2 weeks, in addition to traditional immunosuppressive on-going therapy and eight of them were switched to adalimumab after failure of infliximab therapy. Primary outcome measures included ocular inflammatory activity, frequency of uveitis attacks and steroid-sparing effect. Secondary outcomes were changes of best-corrected visual acuity (BCVA), impact on traditional immunosuppressive therapy and occurrence of adalimumab-related side effects.
RESULTS: Mean age of patients (11 males and 1 female) at the onset of disease was 24.34 years (±8.62 SD). Ocular involvement resulted bilateral in 83% of cases and mainly consisted in panuveitis (68% of eyes). After mean follow-up of 21 months (±9.63 SD) all patients but one (92%) achieved uveitis remission with BCVA improvement at least in one eye. Average uveitis attacks decreased from 2 to 0,42 during adalimumab (p<0.001) and daily-steroid dose was tapered in all adalimumab responders up to suspension in seven of them. No patient developed related side effects during adalimumab administration.
CONCLUSIONS: Our results demonstrate that adalimumab is a very effective and safe option for treatment of patients with severe and resistant Behçet's uveitis, providing an appropriate and long-term control of ocular inflammation.",16,2014-1-1

Changing pattern of uveitis in a subset of a population is an important ocular health indicator.
METHODS: A comparative study was done between uveitis patients of 2013 and 1995 using two proportions Z-test.
RESULTS: In 2013, 352 new uveitis cases were examined. Males 56%, females 44%; unilateral 30.4%; bilateral in 69.6%. A specific diagnosis achieved in 66.2%. Anterior uveitis was seen in 35.22%, intermediate uveitis in 30.11%, posterior uveitis in 25%, and panuveitis in 9.65%. There was no significant difference in the incidence of new uveitic cases (1.04% vs. 1.8%). A decline in male preponderance from 64% to 56% (P = 0.0187) was observed. In both studies, anterior uveitis was the most common but human leukocyte antigen-B27 positivity uveitis had increased (29.83% vs. 14.5%; P < 0.05). Intermediate uveitis was the second-most common type instead of posterior uveitis (P = 0.0006). In posterior uveitis cases, etiology was established in 88.6% versus 56.06% cases (P < 0.05). The most common cause of posterior uveitis was tuberculosis (TB) (35.2%). Viral retinitis had increased to 6.81% from 0.76% (P < 0.05). However, a declining trend in cases of toxoplasmosis was observed (P = 0.0545). The cause of panuveitis was comparable in both studies. The prevalence of TB has significantly increased in the present era (22.5% vs. 0.64%; P < 0.0001) and was the proven etiological cause of uveitis in overall 22.5% of which 4.8% cases were of anterior uveitis cases, 7.1% cases of intermediate uveitis cases, 8.8% cases of posterior uveitis cases, and 1.8% of panuveitis cases.

The objective was to evaluate the 25(OH) vitamin D (25(OH)D) status of patients with juvenile idiopathic arthritis (JIA) and determine whether the 25(OH)D level is associated with disease activity and the course of JIA.
METHODS: Patients ≤ 16 years of age with recently diagnosed JIA (< 12 months) were enrolled in the inception cohort of patients with newly diagnosed JIA (ICON), an ongoing prospective observational, controlled multicenter study started in 2010. Clinical and laboratory parameters were ascertained quarterly during the first year and half-yearly thereafter. Of the 954 enrolled patients, 360 patients with two blood samples taken during the first 2 years after inclusion and with follow up of 3 years were selected. The serum 25(OH)D levels were determined and compared with those of subjects from the general population after matching for age, sex, migration status and the month of blood-drawing.
RESULTS: Nearly half of the patients had a deficient 25(OH)D level (< 20 ng/ml) in the first serum sample and a quarter had a deficient level in both samples. Disease activity and the risk of developing JIA-associated uveitis were inversely correlated with the 25(OH)D level (β = - 0.20, 95% CI - 0.37; 0.03, hazard ratio 0.95, 95% CI 0.91; 0.99, respectively).
CONCLUSION: In this study, 25(OH)D deficiency was common and associated with higher disease activity and risk of developing JIA-associated uveitis. Further studies are needed to substantiate these results and determine whether correcting 25(OH)D deficiency is beneficial in JIA.",16,2018-Dec-13

Although uveitis remains the third leading cause of preventable blindness in the US, the care and management of patients with uveitis and ocular inflammatory disease sit poised to make evolutionary if not revolutionary changes in the years ahead. This review serves to highlight important advances in the pharmacologic options available for the treatment of uveitis and ocular inflammation.
AREAS COVERED: Advances in steroid therapy (both topical and extended delivery), updates in the clinical safety of systemic immune modulation, and the emerging therapies for uveitis and ocular inflammatory disease are some of the areas covered in this review.
EXPERT OPINION: Corticosteroids have been the mainstay in the care of patients with ocular inflammatory disorders for many years. Indeed, some physicians still use only steroids for treating inflamed eyes. However, the mission is remission of all corticosteroids in order to prevent the complications associated with long-term corticosteroid use. The goal is to achieve quiescence through aggressive use of corticosteroids to extinguish the fire and then move along to achieve steroid-free remission through immunosuppressant agents.",16,2011-Nov-1

Progranulin (PGRN) is an important immune regulatory molecule in several immune-mediated diseases. The objective of this study is to investigate the role of PGRN in uveitis and its counterpart, experimental autoimmune uveitis (EAU), and experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis (EAE).
METHODS: Serum PGRN levels in patients with Behcet disease (BD) or Vogt-Koyanagi-Harada (VKH) disease and normal controls were measured by ELISA. EAE and EAU were induced in B10RIII, wild-type, and PGRN
RESULTS: A significantly decreased PGRN expression was observed in patients with active BD and active VKH. Recombinant PGRN significantly reduced EAU severity in association with a decreased frequency of Th17 and Th1 cells. PGRN
DISCUSSION: Our results collectively reveal an important protective role of PGRN in EAU and EAE. These studies suggest that PGRN could serve as an immunoregulatory target in the study of prevention and treatment for the Th1/Th17-mediated diseases.",16,2022-Mar-1

Background. In advanced cutaneous melanoma, new systemic therapies include immunotherapy by checkpoint inhibition and targeted inhibition of the mitogen-activated protein kinase pathway; these are becoming increasingly well established. We describe the clinical presentation of uveitis in three patients with concomitant systemic melanoma treatment. History and Signs. Three patients with metastatic melanoma receiving systemic therapy (ipilimumab, vemurafenib) presented at our institution with a short history of ocular symptoms. Clinical findings included anterior uveitis, intermediate uveitis, disc swelling, inflammatory choroidal lesions and retinal vasculitis. Therapy and Outcome. All three patients responded well to local and/or systemic steroid treatment. In one case, the systemic anti-cancer drug was discontinued after the onset of uveitis. Conclusions. Ocular inflammation may occur in the setting of systemic melanoma therapy. Presentations of uveitis include Vogt-Koyanagi-Harada-like syndromes. Ocular inflammation can usually be controlled by topical and sometimes systemic corticosteroid therapy. However, treatment guidelines are not established and management of these patients demands close cooperation with the oncologist.",16,2016-Apr-1

To give an overview of recently published articles covering risk factors, novel biomarkers and treatment for noninfectious uveitis in children.
RECENT FINDINGS: In the last few years, several genetic markers, serum biomarkers, aqueous humor markers, tear biomarkers and clinical factors have been identified, which are associated with childhood noninfectious uveitis. We describe the most important reports in this field that may help to tailor the screening and monitoring of this population in the future and might become the target of novel therapies. The advances in the biologic therapy of paediatric uveitis, thanks to evidence provided by the SYCAMORE, ADJUVITE and APTITUDE trials, offer new possibilities for the treatment of patients who fail methotrexate with adalimumab and tocilizumab. We discuss the importance of comprehensive outcome measures as proposed by the Multinational Interdisciplinary Working Group for Uveitis in Childhood (MIWGUC).
SUMMARY: Paediatric noninfectious uveitis is a sight-threatening condition and the identification of risk factors and novel biomarkers is critical for tailored management. Biologic therapies are revolutionizing the outcomes of patients resistant to conventional therapy. Increasing our knowledge of disease pathogenesis is crucial to improve targeting of screening to those at highest risk and stratification of treatments.",16,2020-Sep-1

Equine recurrent uveitis (ERU) is considered one of the most important eye diseases in horses and typically appears with relapsing inflammatory episodes without systemic effects. Various disorders have been described as an initial trigger, including infections. Independent of the initiating cause, there are numerous indications that ERU is an immune-mediated disease. We investigated whether neutrophil extracellular traps (NETs) are part of the ERU pathogenesis. Therefore, vitreous body fluids (VBF), sera, and histological sections of the eye from ERU-diseased horses were analyzed for the presence of NET markers and compared with horses with healthy eyes. In addition, NET formation by blood derived neutrophils was investigated in the presence of VBF derived from horses with healthy eyes versus ERU-diseased horses using immunofluorescence microscopy. Interestingly, NET markers like free DNA, histone-complexes, and myeloperoxidase were detected in higher amounts in samples from ERU-diseased horses. Furthermore, in vitro NET formation was higher in neutrophils incubated with VBF from diseased horses compared with those animals with healthy eyes. Finally, we characterized the ability of equine cathelicidins to induce NETs, as potential NET inducing factors in ERU-diseased horses. In summary, our findings lead to the hypothesis that ERU-diseased horses develop more NETs and that these may contribute to the pathogenesis of ERU.",16,2019-Nov-27

To investigate frequencies and clinical features of intraocular inflammation (uveitis) in Tokyo, Japan.
METHODS: Records of 834 consecutive new referral patients (352 men, 482 women) examined at the Kyorin University Hospital from April 2000 to December 2007 were retrospectively reviewed.
RESULTS: Mean age at onset was 44.8 years for men and 47.0 years for women. By anatomical classification, 229 patients (27.4%) had anterior uveitis, 10 (1.2%) had intermediate uveitis, 183 (21.9%) had posterior uveitis and 412 (49.4%) had panuveitis. The most common diagnoses were Vogt-Koyanagi-Harada (VKH) disease (11.0%), sarcoidosis (6.9%), acute anterior uveitis (6.5%), Behçet's disease (5.8%) and tuberculosis (4.3%). In the third and fourth decades, the most common diseases were Behçet's disease for men and VKH for women, whereas over 60 years of age, the most common diseases were VKH for men and sarcoidosis for women. Systemic corticosteroids were used in 25.5% of patients, and other immunomodulatory agents were required in 8.7% of patients.
CONCLUSIONS: The most frequent diagnoses were sarcoidosis, VKH disease, acute anterior uveitis, Behçet's disease and tuberculosis, with Behçet's disease being common in young men and sarcoidosis being common in elderly women. One-fourth of patients received systemic corticosteroids and 8.7% of patients required other immunomodulatory agents.",16,2009-Aug-1

To analyze the patterns and etiologies of uveitis at a tertiary referral center in Taiwan.
METHODS: This retrospective chart review of uveitis patients from January 2001 to December 2014 updates a previous study a decade ago (2003).
RESULTS: We identified 450 patients, among whom anterior uveitis was most common, followed by panuveitis, posterior uveitis, and intermediate uveitis. A specific diagnosis was identified in 331 patients. In 73 infectious uveitis cases, herpetic anterior uveitis was the leading cause, followed by endogenous bacterial endophthalmitis and acute retinal necrosis. In 258 non-infectious uveitis cases, HLA-B27-associated uveitis was most commonly seen, followed by Vogt-Koyanagi-Harada disease and Posner-Schlossman syndrome. Compared with our previous study, we found more viral infection and sarcoidosis but fewer cases of Behçet disease, tuberculosis, and toxoplasmosis.
CONCLUSIONS: Our results provide useful information about the patterns and etiologies of uveitis in a selected population in Taiwan.",16,2017-1-1

Behçet's disease (BD) is known to be associated with HLA-B*51, especially HLA-B*5101, in many different ethnic groups. Recently, several HLA-A or -B alleles have been proposed as possible candidate genes for BD in addition to HLA-B*5101. To investigate those associations, we studied HLA-A and -B alleles in Japanese ocular BD patients and the association of possible susceptibility HLA genes with visual prognosis.
METHODS: Eighty-eight Japanese BD patients with uveitis and 104 healthy controls were enrolled for analyses of HLA-A and B alleles. Statistical analysis was performed with Fisher's exact test and odds ratio (OR). Association of the possible susceptible HLA gene and visual prognosis was also examined.
RESULTS: The phenotype frequency (PF) of HLA-A*2601 was significantly higher in the patients (37.5%) than the controls (14.4%) (pc=0.00529, OR=3.56), especially in patients without HLA-B*5101 (57.4% vs. 14.1%, pc=4.58x10-6, OR=8.21). In contrast, the PF of HLA-A*2601 was not increased in patients with HLA-B*5101 (14.6% vs. 15.8%). Also, the PF in patients possessing HLA-A*2601 or HLAB* 5101 was increased up to 77.3%. Interestingly, the PF of HLA-A*2601 was significantly associated with poor visual prognosis corresponding to visual acuity of 0.1 or less in the worse eye (p=0.0262).
CONCLUSIONS: Our results indicate that HLA-A*2601 is possibly associated with ocular BD, independent of HLAB* 5101, indicating that HLA-A*2601 is an additional susceptibility allele candidate of ocular BD in Japan. HLAA* 2601 would also be a possible marker for poor visual prognosis.",16,2010-1-1

The Collaborative Ocular Tuberculosis Study (COTS), supported by the International Ocular Inflammation Society, International Uveitis Study Group, and Foster Ocular Immunological Society, set up an international, expert-led consensus project to develop evidence- and experience-based guidelines for the management of tubercular uveitis (TBU).
CLINICAL RELEVANCE: The absence of international agreement on the use of antitubercular therapy (ATT) in patients with TBU contributes to a significant heterogeneity in the approach to the management of this condition.
METHODS: Consensus statements for the initiation of ATT in TBU were generated using a 2-step modified Delphi technique. In Delphi step 1, a smart web-based survey based on background evidence from published literature was prepared to collect the opinion of 81 international experts on the use of ATT in different clinical scenarios. The survey included 324 questions related to tubercular anterior uveitis (TAU), tubercular intermediate uveitis (TIU), tubercular panuveitis (TPU), and tubercular retinal vasculitis (TRV) administered by the experts, after which the COTS group met in November 2019 for a systematic and critical discussion of the statements in accordance with the second round of the modified Delphi process.
RESULTS: Forty-four consensus statements on the initiation of ATT in TAU, TIU, TPU, and TRV were obtained, based on ocular phenotypes suggestive of TBU and corroborative evidence of tuberculosis, provided by several combinations of immunologic and radiologic test results. Experts agreed on initiating ATT in recurrent TAU, TIU, TPU, and active TRV depending on the TB endemicity. In the presence of positive results for any 1 of the immunologic tests along with radiologic features suggestive of past evidence of tuberculosis infection. In patients with a first episode of TAU, consensus to initiate ATT was reached only if both immunologic and radiologic test results were positive.
DISCUSSION: The COTS consensus guidelines were generated based on the evidence from published literature, specialists' opinions, and logic construction to address the initiation of ATT in TBU. The guidelines also should inform public policy by adding specific types of TBU to the list of conditions that should be treated as tuberculosis.",16,2021-Feb-1

The uveitides are a heterogenous group of ocular inflammatory disorders that account for the third highest cause of blindness worldwide, responsible for 5-10% of visual impairment globally. Up to 35% of patients with uveitis can suffer significant vision loss. To prevent irreversible structural damage and blindness, it is important that the diagnosis and commencement of appropriate therapy occurs promptly. Management includes topical and systemic corticosteroid therapy and conventional immunomodulatory agents, including methotrexate, azathioprine, mycophenolate mofetil and cyclosporin. Significant progress has been made in the past decade in our understanding of the immunopathological pathways that drive intraocular inflammation, allowing the development of targeted therapy with biologic agents. These include TNF-α inhibitors, such as infliximab, adalimumab and etanercept; interleukin blockers, such as tocilizumab and daclizumab; and other targeted therapies, such as rituximab and abatacept. The efficacy of these agents has been studied in cases of severe uveitis that are refractory to conventional immunomodulatory agents and provide exciting results that have revolutionised uveitis management. Though the biologic era has provided a large armamentarium to treat uveitis, ongoing challenges and cases of recalcitrant uveitis remain, posing a challenge to internal medicine physicians. This comprehensive review aims to construct an updated summary on the existing evidence pertaining to the use of biologic agents in the treatment of uveitis. Methods include a systematic search for studies between 2000 and 2018 using PubMed, EMBASE, Ovid MEDLINE and Cochrane libraries.",16,2019-Nov-1

Uveitis is the most common ophthalmological finding in the practice of rheumatology and clinical immunology. The condition is frequently idiopathic but about 60 causes of uveitis have been described. Our aim was to analyze the clinical patterns and etiologies of uveitis in a tertiary referral center.
METHODS: The records of 912 consecutive patients referred to the department of internal medicine (Lyon University Hospital, Lyon, France) for the diagnostic work-up of uveitis were examined. Demographic, clinical, anatomical, and etiological features of uveitis were analyzed.
RESULTS: The mean age at onset was 48.8 years; 59.8% of the patients were women and 78.2% were Caucasians. Anterior uveitis was the most common type of uveitis (40.6%), followed by panuveitis (31.7%), posterior (18.75%) and intermediate uveitis (9%). 46.9% of the patients had idiopathic uveitis. The most common etiologies were systemic diseases (37.3%), such as sarcoidosis (17.1%), HLA-B27-related uveitis and/or spondyloarthritis (12.5%), and tuberculosis (7.5%).
CONCLUSION: We describe one of the largest cohorts of consecutive uveitis patients referred to a department of internal medicine. The high percentage of uveitis associated with underlying (systemic) diseases highlights the need for a multidisciplinary approach, in order to reduce the diagnostic delay.",16,2019-Sep-1

The purpose of this study was to investigate the safety and effectiveness of an intravitreally injected dexamethasone-containing implant (Ozurdex(®)) in the treatment of uveitis in children.
METHODS: The study group included ten patients (14 eyes) aged 6.5-15 years (mean age 12 years) with intermediate or posterior uveitis who were treated with the Ozurdex implant at two tertiary medical centers between 2009 and 2014, following an insufficient response to standard uveitis therapy. All were followed for at least 6 months (mean 12.2 ± 4.9 months). Clinical data before and after treatment were collected retrospectively from the medical files. Outcome measures were best corrected visual acuity, vitreous haze, and macular thickness. Ocular complications were documented.
RESULTS: Visual acuity improved in 12 eyes (86 %) and intraocular inflammation decreased in 13 eyes (93 %) from 1 week to 3 months after the first injection. Macular edema decreased in all eyes from 1 month to 3 months after the first injection. Five patients underwent repeated injections because of an increase in macular thickness at 3-6 month follow-up. Complications included cataract progression in one patient after one injection and cataract formation in two patients after two injections, and an elevation in intraocular pressure in two patients who responded well to topical treatment.
CONCLUSIONS: Both single and repeated injections of a dexamethasone-containing implant are safe and effective for the treatment of noninfectious intermediate and posterior uveitis in children. The duration of the beneficial effect may be limited. More data are required to establish the safety profile of the implant in the pediatric age group.",16,2015-Oct-1

During experimental autoimmune uveoretinitis (EAU), infiltrating macrophages become activated to express nitric oxide synthase (NOS)-2 and generate nitric oxide (NO). The current study was designed to determine whether neutralizing TNF activity with a soluble fusion protein of TNFp55 receptor (sTNFr-IgG) inhibits macrophage activation, thereby contributing to reduced tissue damage observed with such treatment.
METHODS: EAU was induced in Lewis rats by active immunization with soluble retinal extract (RE) and pertussis toxin (intraperitoneally), and animals were treated on days 6 and 8 after immunization with either sTNFr-IgG or human (hu)IgG. Disease course and severity were noted clinically, and eyes were enucleated for histologic scoring, including TUNEL immunofluorescence, at various stages of disease. Infiltrating retinal macrophages were isolated through a density gradient and subsequently phenotyped by flow cytometry, analyzed for ability to produce nitrite, either spontaneously or after cytokine stimulation, and assayed by PCR for cytokine gene expression.
RESULTS: Neutralizing TNF activity suppressed tissue damage without impeding myeloid cell infiltrate. Moreover, with sTNFr-IgG treatment, infiltrating macrophages demonstrated reduced nitrite production at the height of disease, and the level of apoptosis within the retina of both ED1(+) cells and resident cells was reduced. PCR analysis demonstrated a significant increase in TGF beta signal and absent or low TNF signal throughout the disease course after treatment with sTNFr-IgG.
CONCLUSIONS: sTNFr-IgG successfully suppresses retinal damage and impairs macrophage activation but not trafficking during EAU. sTNFr-IgG-mediated suppression of NO production results in reduced levels of apoptosis of inflammatory cells and reduction in photoreceptor damage.",16,2003-Jul-1

Synthetic oligodeoxynucleotides (ODN) expressing 'suppressive' TTAGGG motifs down-regulate a variety of proinflammatory and T helper type 1 (Th1)-mediated pathological immune responses. The ability of the archetypal suppressive ODN A151 to inhibit ocular inflammation was examined in two murine models: experimental autoimmune uveitis, induced by immunization with a retinal antigen, interphotoreceptor retinoid-binding protein (IRBP) and adoptively transferred ocular inflammation, induced by transferring Th1 cells specific to hen egg lysozyme (HEL) into recipient mice that express HEL in their eyes. A151 treatment suppressed the inflammation in both models. In addition, A151 inhibited IRBP-specific cytokine production and lymphocyte proliferation in mice immunized with IRBP. These findings suggest that suppressive ODN affects both afferent and efferent limbs of the immunopathogenic process and may be of use in the treatment of autoimmune ocular inflammation.",16,2009-Jun-1

We tested the hypothesis that interaction between autoantigens and chemoattractant receptors may be an important step in the development of autoimmunity. The retinal autoantigens S-antigen (S-Ag) and interphotoreceptor retinoid binding protein (IRBP) can induce autoimmune uveitis in rodent models. We evaluated the chemotactic activity of S-Ag and IRBP and found that both induced migration of human and mouse immature dendritic cells (iDCs) and lymphocytes, but not neutrophils, monocytes, or mature DCs. Cross-desensitization studies and single-receptor transfected cells revealed that subfamily of alpha chemokine receptors CXCR5 and CXCR3 mediated the chemotactic effect of IRBP, while only CXCR3 was required for the chemotactic response to S-Ag. Examination of the relationships between chemoattraction and the ability to elicit pathology at the protein or peptide levels in the mouse uveitis model revealed dissociation of the capacity to induce uveitis, lymphocyte proliferation, and chemoattraction. These studies suggest that IRBP and S-Ag can initiate innate and, in sensitive individuals, adaptive immune response by attracting iDCs and T and B cells expressing CXCR3 and CXCR5.",16,2005-Jun-01

Juvenile idiopathic arthritis (JIA) is often associated with severe chronic anterior uveitis (CAU), and immunosuppressive therapy may be required. In this study, the value of cyclosporine A (CsA) as monotherapy or as combination therapy for treating uveitis was studied in a large cohort of JIA children.
METHODS: Multicentre retrospective study including 82 JIA children (girls n=60) suffering from unilateral or bilateral (n=55) CAU. The indication for CsA was active uveitis, although patients were on topical or systemic corticosteroids, MTX, or other immunosuppressive drugs.
RESULTS: Inactivity of uveitis during the entire treatment period (mean 3.9 years) was obtained with CsA monotherapy in 6 of 25 (24%) patients, but more often when CsA was combined with the immunosuppressives (35/72 patients; 48.6%, P=0.037), or MTX (18/37 patients, 48.6%, P=0.065), which had already been given. With CsA (mean dosage 2.9 mg/kg), systemic immunosuppressive drugs and steroids could be reduced by >or=50% (n=19) or topical steroids reduced to <or=2 drops/eye/day (n=40) in selected patients. Pre-existing cystoid macular oedema did not resolve under CsA treatment in any of the patients. In nine patients (11%), CsA was discontinued because of systemic hypertension (n=1), elevated creatinine levels (n=3), or other adverse effects (n=5).
CONCLUSIONS: These observations suggest that CsA has limited value as a second-line immunosuppressive drug for the treatment of JIA-associated CAU. The efficacy was better as the combination therapy in patients not responding to other immunosuppressives (eg, MTX) than the systemic monotherapy.",16,2009-May-1

To determine classification criteria for birdshot chorioretinitis.
DESIGN: Machine learning of cases with birdshot chorioretinitis and 8 other posterior uveitides.
METHODS: Cases of posterior uveitides were collected in an informatics-designed preliminary database, and a final database was constructed of cases achieving supermajority agreement on diagnosis, using formal consensus techniques. Cases were split into a training set and a validation set. Machine learning using multinomial logistic regression was used on the training set to determine a parsimonious set of criteria that minimized the misclassification rate among the infectious posterior uveitides / panuveitides. The resulting criteria were evaluated on the validation set.
RESULTS: One thousand sixty-eight cases of posterior uveitides, including 207 cases of birdshot chorioretinitis, were evaluated by machine learning. Key criteria for birdshot chorioretinitis included a multifocal choroiditis with (1) the characteristic appearance of a bilateral multifocal choroiditis with cream-colored or yellow-orange, oval or round choroidal spots (""birdshot"" spots); (2) absent to mild anterior chamber inflammation; and (3) absent to moderate vitreous inflammation; or multifocal choroiditis with positive HLA-A29 testing and either classic ""birdshot spots"" or characteristic imaging on indocyanine green angiography. Overall accuracy for posterior uveitides was 93.9% in the training set and 98.0% (95% confidence interval 94.3, 99.3) in the validation set. The misclassification rates for birdshot chorioretinitis were 10% in the training set and 0% in the validation set.
CONCLUSIONS: The criteria for birdshot chorioretinitis had a low misclassification rate and seemed to perform sufficiently well for use in clinical and translational research.",16,2021-Aug-1

To analyze the outcomes of phacoemulsification cataract extraction and intraocular lens (IOL) implantation in patients with uveitis.
SETTING: Miyata Eye Hospital, Miyakonojo, Miyazaki, Japan.
METHODS: The records of 95 patients (131 eyes) with uveitis who had phacoemulsification cataract extraction and IOL implantation between 1990 and 2001 were retrospectively examined. The postoperative visual outcomes and complications were analyzed.
RESULTS: The mean age of the 36 men and 59 women was 61.7 years (range 30 to 87 years) At the final follow-up examination, 111 eyes (84.7%) had improved visual acuity and 97 eyes (74.0%) had a final visual acuity of 0.5 or better. Patients with Behçet's disease had significantly worse visual outcomes than patients with other clinical etiologies of uveitis such as human T-lymphotropic virus type 1 uveitis and Vogt-Koyanagi-Harada disease. In 17 eyes (13.0%), relapse of intraocular inflammation occurred within 6 months after surgery; the rate of relapse was highest in patients with Behçet's disease (35.2%). Posterior synechias occurred in 8 eyes (6.1%), pupillary capture in 1 eye (0.8%), intraocular pressure elevation in 11 eyes (8.4%), and cystoid macula edema in 8 eyes (6.1%). In 31 eyes (23.7%), posterior capsule opacification required neodymium:YAG capsulotomy.
CONCLUSIONS: The outcomes of phacoemulsification cataract extraction and IOL implantation in patients with uveitis were satisfactory. Patients with Behçet's disease related to intraocular inflammation, however, appeared to have a higher risk for complications and therefore worse outcomes than patients with other clinical etiologies of uveitis.",16,2007-Feb-1

Demographic and clinical features, recurrence rate, and visual outcome were analyzed. Fifty patients were male, 61 were female. Mean age at presentation was 39.2 ± 16.5 (6-74) years. Three atopic patients had bilateral involvement. Twelve patients had active or a past episode of herpes zoster ophthalmicus. Ocular findings were granulamatous anterior uveitis (93%), active keratitis or corneal scars (57%), elevated intraocular pressure (51%), iris atrophy (48%), distorted pupil (25%), and posterior synechiae (26%). Secondary glaucoma developed in two patients. None of the patients had posterior segment complications. The recurrence rate was 0.45/person-year. Topical corticosteroids and oral antiviral therapy were administered to all patients during active episodes. Long-term prophylactic oral acyclovir was used in 13%. Final visual acuity was worse than 0.5 in 17% of the involved eyes and was due to corneal scarring or cataract formation. Patients with iridocyclitis only had no permanent visual loss. Herpetic anterior uveitis is a recurrent granulomatous disease commonly associated with corneal involvement, iris atrophy, and transient intraocular pressure rise. Visual prognosis is good, especially in patients who have only anterior uveitis without corneal disease.",16,2010-Oct-1

Experimental autoimmune anterior uveitis (EAAU) is an organ-specific autoimmune disease induced by immunization with bovine melanin-associated antigen (MAA) and two adjuvants (complete Freund's adjuvant and purified pertussis toxin). This study was undertaken to explore whether an adjuvant is required in the induction of EAAU.
METHODS: Insoluble MAA was extracted from the bovine iris and ciliary body. Soluble bovine MAA was derived by treatment of insoluble MAA with the proteolytic enzyme, V8 protease. Lewis rats were immunized with the insoluble or soluble antigen, with or without adjuvant (complete Freund's adjuvant and purified pertussis toxin). Adoptive transfer of CD4+ and CD8+ T cells was performed to investigate the pathogenesis of EAAU.
RESULTS: Experimental autoimmune anterior uveitis can be induced in Lewis rats by immunization with 100 g insoluble bovine MAA alone without the use of adjuvants. The disease can be adoptively transferred to naive syngenic rats by primed CD4+ T cells. In contrast, soluble bovine MAA was not uveitogenic unless adjuvants were employed.
CONCLUSIONS: The data suggest that EAAU can be induced in the Lewis rat without addition of an adjuvant. Future studies concerning the pathogenesis of EAAU can now be performed without the possible confounding effect of an adjuvant.",16,1997-Sep-1

Behçet disease is a chronic relapsing multisystem inflammatory disorder. Ocular involvement is characterized by a bilateral recurrent non-granulomatous panuveitis and retinal vasculitis. Posterior segment findings vary during the course of the disease, in parallel with the relapsing and remitting intraocular inflammation. Structural alterations occur with increased disease duration. Fluorescein angiography is the gold standard in revealing the extent and severity as well as the leaky and/or occlusive nature of retinal vasculitis. Multimodal imaging using color fundus photography, fluorescein angiography, and optical coherence tomography is essential in visualizing diagnostic features, detecting structural changes, and monitoring disease activity and response to treatment in patients with Behçet uveitis.",16,2017-Feb-1

Rupture of the lens capsule in 20 dogs resulted in zonal, perilenticular inflammation that did not respond to symptomatic therapy and resulted in the loss of the globe. The reaction was dominated by lens epithelial proliferation, pupillary occlusion, and glaucoma in 11 of the 20. This reaction, herein named phacoclastic uveitis, is unique and easily distinguished from the mild lymphocytic-plasmacytic anterior uveitis that accompanies leakage of lens material through an intact capsule of a hypermature cataract (phacolytic uveitis). None of the dog eyes had the granulomatous perilenticular inflammation that is the hallmark of lens-induced (phacoanaphylactic) uveitis in humans.",16,1987-Nov-1

To describe the pattern of uveitis in patients seen at the uveitis clinic of the East Avenue Medical Center, Philippines.
METHODS: Clinical records of patients seen from January 2010 to June 2015 were reviewed. Data collected included demographics, clinical presentation, associated systemic disease, work-up, and diagnosis.
RESULTS: A total of 595 records were reviewed. The mean age at presentation was 38 ± 18.4 years. The majority of the cases were unilateral and chronic. Anterior uveitis was the most common, followed by panuveitis, posterior uveitis, and intermediate uveitis. Uveitis was idiopathic in 54.1%, while specific diagnosis was found in 45.9%. Infectious cause of uveitis was found in 25.6% with tuberculosis (TB) being the most common followed by toxoplasmosis. Vogt-Koyanagi-Harada (VKH) was the most common cause of non-infectious uveitis followed by Fuchs' heterochromic iridocyclitis (FHI).
CONCLUSIONS: In a tertiary hospital in the Philippines, the most common causes of uveitis were TB, VKH, toxoplasmosis, FHI, and sympathetic ophthalmia.",16,2017-1-1

To assess the long-term outcome of uveitis in juvenile idiopathic arthritis (JIA).
DESIGN: Population-based, multicenter, prospective JIA cohort, with a cross-sectional assessment of JIA-associated uveitis (JIA-U) 18 years after the onset of JIA.
PARTICIPANTS: A total of 434 patients with JIA, of whom 96 had uveitis, from defined geographic areas of Denmark, Finland, Norway, and Sweden.
METHODS: Patients with onset of JIA between January 1997 and June 2000 were prospectively followed for 18 years. Pediatric rheumatologists and ophthalmologists collected clinical and laboratory data.
MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Cumulative incidence of uveitis and clinical characteristics, JIA and uveitis disease activity, ocular complications, visual outcome, and risk factors associated with the development of uveitis-related complications.
RESULTS: Uveitis developed in 96 (22.1%) of 434 patients with JIA. In 12 patients (2.8%), uveitis was diagnosed between 8 and 18 years of follow-up. Systemic immunosuppressive medication was more common among patients with uveitis (47/96 [49.0%]) compared with patients without uveitis (78/338 [23.1%]). Active uveitis was present in 19 of 78 patients (24.4%) at the 18-year visit. Ocular complications occurred in 31 of 80 patients (38.8%). Short duration between the onset of JIA and the diagnosis of uveitis was a risk factor for developing ocular complications (odds ratio [OR], 1.4; 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.1-1.8). Patients with a diagnosis of uveitis before the onset of JIA all developed cataract and had an OR for development of glaucoma of 31.5 (95% CI, 3.6-274). Presence of antinuclear antibodies (ANAs) was also a risk factor for developing 1 or more ocular complications (OR, 3.0; 95% CI, 1.2-7.7). Decreased visual acuity (VA) <6/12 was found in 12 of 135 eyes (8.9%) with uveitis, and 4 of 80 patients (5.0%) with JIA-U had binocular decreased VA <6/12.
CONCLUSIONS: Our results suggest that uveitis screening should start immediately when the diagnosis of JIA is suspected or confirmed and be continued for more than 8 years after the diagnosis of JIA. Timely systemic immunosuppressive treatment in patients with a high risk of developing ocular complications must be considered early in the disease course to gain rapid control of ocular inflammation.",16,2021-Apr-1

To report and compare the results of trabeculectomy with mitomycin C (MMC) and Ahmed valve implantation in the management of uveitic glaucoma.
PATIENTS AND METHODS: The records of 41 eyes of 29 patients who underwent trabeculectomy with MMC or Ahmed valve implantation for uveitic glaucoma were retrospectively reviewed. Seventeen eyes underwent trabeculectomy with MMC, and 24 eyes underwent Ahmed valve implantation. Outcomes included postoperative intraocular pressure (IOP), percent reduction from preoperative IOP, postoperative number of medications, time to failure, and complications.
RESULTS: Mean follow-up was 21.2 months in the trabeculectomy group and 23.8 months in the valve group (P=0.06). Mean IOP was reduced from 29.2 to 18.4 mm Hg in the trabeculectomy group (31.3%), compared with a reduction from 33.4 to 15.5 mm Hg in the Ahmed valve group (42.7%, P=0.53). Postoperatively, 1.76 medications were used in the trabeculectomy group, compared with 1.83 medications in the Ahmed valve group (P=0.89). Cumulative success at 1 year was 66.7% in the trabeculectomy group, compared with 100% in the Ahmed valve group (P=0.02). Mean time to failure was 8.36 months with trabeculectomy, and 21.8 months with Ahmed valve (P=0.02). Complications in both groups were typically rare and self-limited, with recurrent inflammation being most common.
CONCLUSIONS: Although both trabeculectomy with MMC and Ahmed valve implantation are reasonable surgical options in the management of uncontrolled uveitic glaucoma, Ahmed valve implantation was associated with higher cumulative success rate at 1 year and a longer mean time to failure.",16,2015-1-1

To evaluate the effects of an interleukin 1 receptor antagonist (IL-1RA) on the development of immune-mediated ocular inflammation in mice.
METHODS: Recombinant, human, nonglycosylated IL-1RA (anakinra [kineret]) was tested for its inhibitory effects in 2 systems: (1) experimental autoimmune uveitis induced by interphotoreceptor retinoid-binding protein in B10.A mice using routine procedures and evaluated by clinical and histological examination, and (2) ocular inflammation in mice induced by transfer of hen egg lysozyme-specific T cells to hen egg lysozyme-transgenic mice. Treatment with IL-1RA included daily subcutaneous injections of the drug, at 300 and 500 mg/kg, or phosphate-buffered saline as control.
RESULTS: Mean +/- SE experimental autoimmune uveitis scores of histological ocular changes of the mice at day 14 postimmunization with interphotoreceptor retinoid-binding protein were 1.5 +/- 0.3 in control mice; 1.0 +/- 0.4 in 300-mg/kg anakinra-treated mice; and 0.5 +/- 0.2 in 500- mg/kg anakinra-treated mice (P = .004). There was a corresponding decrease in the cellular immune response and cytokine production of immune cells in treated mice. Suppression of ocular inflammation by anakinra in the transfer system was also observed (P = .04).
CONCLUSION: Human IL-1RA suppresses immune-mediated ocular inflammation in mice, affecting both the afferent and efferent components of the pathogenic immune response.Clinical Relevance Systemic administration of IL-1RA may have clinical application in the management of patients with uveitis.",16,2005-Jul-1

We studied an enucleated eye from a patient with a 30-year history of Vogt-Koyanagi-Harada syndrome using both conventional and immunohistochemical techniques. Clinically, the eye was in the end stage of Vogt-Koyanagi-Harada syndrome, and was characterized by the absence of inflammation, large areas of chorioretinal scarring, and pigmentary changes. Histopathologic examination showed marked retinal gliosis, extensive chorioretinal adhesion and scar formation, migration of pigment into the retina, and severe retinal pigment epithelial changes. However, foci of mild to moderate nongranulomatous inflammation of the uvea were observed. These foci contained infiltrating cells that were mainly T lymphocytes with B lymphocyte aggregates at the center. Scattered macrophages were also noted in the uvea and retina. These findings suggest that both the cell-mediated and humoral immune arms may play roles in the pathogenesis of Vogt-Koyanagi-Harada syndrome.",16,1988-Jun-15

To investigate the anti-inflammatory effect of topical application of Curcuma longa (C. longa) and Berberis aristata (B. aristata) aqueous extracts on experimental uveitis in the rabbit.
METHODS: Anterior uveitis was induced in rabbits by intravitreal injection of lipopolysaccharide from Escherichia coli after pretreatment with C. longa and B. aristata aqueous extracts. Subsequently, the anti-inflammatory activity of C. longa and B. aristata was evaluated by grading the clinical signs and histopathologic changes and estimating the inflammatory cell count, protein, and TNF-alpha levels in the aqueous humor.
RESULTS: The anterior segment inflammation in the control group was significantly higher than in both the extract-treated groups, as observed by clinical and histopathologic grading. The inflammatory cell count in the control group was 30.75 +/- 7.33 x 10(5) cells/mL, whereas it was 2.39 +/- 0.59 x 10(5) (P < 0.001 vs. control) and 11.56 +/- 2.44 x 10(5) (P = 0.001 vs. control) cells/mL in the C. longa- and B. aristata-treated groups, respectively. The protein content of the aqueous humor was 18.14 +/- 4.98, 3.16 +/- 0.55 (P < 0.001 vs. control), and 8.24 +/- 1.42 (P < 0.01 vs. control) mg/mL in the control, C. longa-, and B. aristata-treated groups, respectively. The aqueous TNF-alpha level in the control group was 976.29 +/- 66.38 pg/mL and was 311.96 +/- 28.50 (P < 0.0001 vs. control) and 654.09 +/- 47.66 (P < 0.001vs. control) pg/mL in the C. longa- and B. aristata-treated groups, respectively.

Gut inflammation plays a crucial role in the pathogenesis of spondylarthropathies (SpA) since ileocolonoscopic studies have demonstrated the presence of gut inflammation in different forms of this concept: in ankylosing spondylitis (AS) (60%), in enterogenic (90%) and urogenital reactive arthritis (20%), in undifferentiated SpA (65%), in the pauciarticular and axial forms of psoriatic arthritis (16%), in late onset pauciarticular juvenile chronic arthritis (80%) and in acute anterior uveitis (66%). The strong relationship between gut and joint inflammation was demonstrated by performing a second ileocolonoscopy: remission of the joint inflammation was always connected with a disappearance of gut inflammation, whereas persistence of locomotor inflammation was mostly associated with the persistence of gut inflammation. During further evolution 20% of the non-ankylosing spondylitis SpA patients can develop AS. About 6% of the total group SpA patients, in whom inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) was excluded, developed Crohn's disease 5 to 9 years later. All these patients initially presented with gut inflammation, which indicates that this finding has prognostic value. The high prevalence of evolution to IBD in SpA patients confirms the thesis that both disease entities bear common pathogenic mechanisms, and confirms the place of IBD in the concept of SPA. Sulphasalazine (SASP), a successful drug in the treatment of IBD, has demonstrated its effectiveness in the treatment of SpA. The beneficial effect of the drug in this disease entity could be due to its anti-inflammatory effect on the gut wall, by normalizing its permeability and by preventing the entrance of antigens through the defective gut wall. However, SASP could not prevent the evolution to IBD.",16,1996-Feb-1

To evaluate whether early treatment with methotrexate (MTX) prevents the onset of uveitis in children with juvenile idiopathic arthritis.
STUDY DESIGN: The clinical charts of all consecutive patients seen between January 2002 and February 2011 who had a disease duration <1 year at first visit and had received a stable management for at least 2 years with or without MTX were reviewed. Patients who were given systemic medications other than MTX (except nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs) were excluded. Patients with systemic arthritis, rheumatoid factor-positive arthritis, or enthesitis-related arthritis were also excluded. In each patient, the 2-year follow-up period after first visit was examined to establish whether uveitis had occurred.
RESULTS: A total of 254 patients with a median disease duration of 0.3 year were included. Eighty-six patients (33.9%) were treated with MTX, whereas 168 patients (66.1%) did not receive MTX. During the 2-year follow-up, 211 patients (83.1%) did not develop uveitis, whereas 43 patients (16.9%) had uveitis a median of 1.0 year after the first visit. The frequency of uveitis was lower in MTX-treated than in MTX-untreated patients (10.5% vs 20.2%, respectively, P = .049). Survival analysis confirmed that patients treated with MTX had a lower probability of developing uveitis.
CONCLUSION: Early MTX therapy may prevent the onset of uveitis in children with juvenile idiopathic arthritis. Because our study may be affected by confounding by indication, the potential of MTX to reduce the incidence of ocular disease should be investigated in a randomized controlled trial.",16,2013-Sep-1

Autoimmune uveitis is a sight-threatening disease in which autoreactive T cells cross the blood-retinal barrier. Molecular mechanisms contributing to the loss of eye immune privilege in this autoimmune disease are not well understood. In this study, the authors investigated the changes in the matrix metalloproteinase network in spontaneous uveitis.
METHODS: Matrix metalloproteinase (MMP) MMP2, MMP9, and MMP14 expression and tissue inhibitor of metalloproteinase (TIMP)-2 and lipocalin 2 (LCN2) expression were analyzed using Western blot quantification. Enzyme activities were examined with zymography. Expression patterns of network candidates were revealed with immunohistochemistry, comparing physiological appearance and changes in a spontaneous recurrent uveitis model.
RESULTS: TIMP2 protein expression was found to be decreased in both the vitreous and the retina of a spontaneous model for autoimmune uveitis (equine recurrent uveitis [ERU]), and TIMP2 activity was significantly reduced in ERU vitreous. Functionally associated MMPs such as MMP2, MMP14, and MMP9 were found to show altered or shifted expression and activity. Although MMP2 decreased in ERU vitreous, MMP9 expression and activity were found to be increased. These changes were reflected by profound changes within uveitic target tissue, where TIMP2, MMP9, and MMP14 decreased in expression, whereas MMP2 displayed a shifted expression pattern. LCN2, a potential stabilizer of MMP9, was found prominently expressed in equine healthy retina and displayed notable changes in expression patterns accompanied by significant upregulation in autoimmune conditions. Invading cells expressed MMP9 and LCN2.
CONCLUSIONS: This study implicates a dysregulation or a change in functional protein-protein interactions in this TIMP2-associated protein network, together with altered expression of functionally related MMPs.",16,2011-Apr-08

We aimed to investigate the clinical features of intraocular inflammation/uveitis in Hokkaido, Japan.
METHODS: We retrospectively reviewed the medical records of 1240 uveitis patients (511 men, 729 women) who visited Hokkaido University Hospital, Sapporo, Japan between 1994 and 2003.
RESULTS: Mean age at disease onset was 41.7 +/- 17.8 years in men and 45.7 +/- 18.3 years in women. Anterior, posterior and combined anterior and posterior segment intraocular inflammation accounted for 45.1%, 4.7% and 50.2% of cases, respectively. Sarcoidosis was the most frequent aetiology (14.9%), followed by Vogt-Koyanagi-Harada (VKH) disease (9.7%) and Behçet's disease (6.7%). Aetiologies in 49.8% patients were unknown. In sarcoidosis, women represented 72.4% of patients, and disease onset occurred at 35.1 +/- 19.0 years of age in men and 50.3 +/- 16.5 years in women. In VKH disease, 54.2% of patients were women, and disease onset took place at 45.9 +/- 15.8 years in men and 46.4 +/- 14.1 years in women. In Behçet's disease, men accounted for 56.6% of patients, and disease onset occurred at 35.5 +/- 8.5 years in men and 44.5 +/- 11.5 years in women.
CONCLUSIONS: Women were more prone to developing sarcoidosis compared with men. By contrast, men were more prone to developing Behçet's disease. The mean age at disease onset in both sarcoidosis and Behçet's disease was significantly lower in men than in women.",16,2009-Jun-1

To describe the visual and systemic outcomes in patients presenting with sarcoid uveitis.
METHODS: Seventy-five patients with definite or presumed sarcoid uveitis were followed up for a median of 4 years. The patients came from a primary ophthalmic referral centre and a specialist uveitis centre. The prognostic value of demographic and clinical features at the onset of disease were studied. Baseline and outcome variables were analysed by survival analysis.
RESULTS: After 10 years, 54% of patients retained normal visual acuity and 4.6% had lost vision to less than 6/36 in both eyes. Fifty-one per cent required oral steroids for uveitis and a further 11% needed additional immunosuppressants. Twenty-one per cent of patients had undergone a surgical procedure. At the onset of uveitis the lung was the most common organ involved (35%). After 10 years follow-up disease spread to other organs in 13 patients (17%); in 8 of 13 patients this was the central nervous system. The only outcome associated with baseline variables was bilateral visual loss, which was more likely in those over 40 years at presentation (p = 0.004).
CONCLUSIONS: The ocular prognosis of sarcoid uveitis is unrelated to the extent of disease at onset. Patients with extraocular disease fared no differently from those with isolated ocular disease. Patients with sarcoid uveitis are at risk of neurological involvement for at least 15 years.",16,1999-Dec-1

To investigate possible relationships between laser flare photometry values, complications of uveitis, and outcomes in children with chronic uveitis.
DESIGN: Retrospective chart review.
METHOD: We evaluated patients with active, noninfectious anterior, intermediate, or panuveitis who were 16 years of age or younger and who had laser flare photometry at one of two academic institutions. Complications enumerated at baseline and during follow-up were compared with laser flare photometry values and to anterior chamber cell counts.
RESULTS: At least one laser flare photometry value (""flare""), defined as baseline measurement, was available for 59 patients (41 girls, 18 boys; mean age, 10.3 +/- 3.5 years); 38 of these patients had at least one additional measurement during follow-up (median 11 months). Complications of uveitis were present in 35 patients (59%) at baseline. There was a positive association between increased laser flare photometry values and complications at baseline (any complication [P =.007], posterior synechiae [P =.003]). The development of complications during follow-up was associated with the presence of complications at baseline (P =.018). A subgroup of patients with low flare at baseline had no complications during follow-up regardless of treatment given.
CONCLUSIONS: There is a positive relationship between laser flare photometry values and the prevalence of complications of uveitis in children. Laser flare photometry provides a novel way to monitor children with uveitis. Future study will be needed to determine whether values have prognostic importance and whether a treatment strategy that minimizes flare results in fewer uveitic complications.",16,2003-Jun-1

The poor long-term success rate of repeat trabeculectomies in refractory uveitic glaucoma (UG) patients has led to the use of glaucoma drainage devices (GDDs). However, the success and complication rates of GDDs in UG patients utilizing a control group with standard demographic data, design, and surgical technique have never been evaluated.
METHODS: Fifteen patients (15 eyes) with chronic uveitis and 53 patients (53 eyes) with uncontrolled open-angle glaucoma (OAG) who underwent Ahmed glaucoma valve (AGV) implantation were included in a retrospective, comparative, case-controlled study. Postoperative intraocular pressure (IOP), number of antiglaucoma medications, visual acuity, and complications were compared.
RESULTS: There was a significant difference between the UG versus the OAG group with respect to age only (59.3 years vs 68.4 years, p = 0.006). Regression analysis of the postoperative IOP controlled for age and glaucoma type, and preoperative IOP revealed significantly lower IOP in the UG group at 1 month (p = 0.04; 95% confidence interval [CI] -5.9 to 0.15) and 2 months (p = 0.008; 95% CI -6.0 to 0.97). No significant differences were found at 3, 6, 12, 24, and 30 months. The cumulative success rates at 3 to 30 months for the UG and OAG groups were 80% to 66.6% versus 84.9% to 57% (p = 0.713), respectively. The only complication between the 2 groups that was significantly different was tube removal, which occurred more often in the UG group (p = 0.018).
INTERPRETATION: AGV implantation is an effective and safe procedure in the management of UG, similar to primary OAG.",16,2008-Aug-1

In the wake of the international Ebola virus disease (EVD) outbreak from 2014 to 2016, thousands of EVD survivors are at-risk of ophthalmic manifestations, as well as systemic sequelae including arthralgias, abdominal pain, psychosocial stressors, and risk of viral persistence in immune-privileged organs. Ophthalmic manifestations in EVD survivors include a spectrum of disease ranging from anterior uveitis to panuveitis, which confers a high risk of vision impairment and blindness, particularly given the access and resource limitations for ophthalmic subspecialty care in West Africa. Clinical studies in EVD survivors, animal models of EVD and translational investigation, have provided early insight into eye disease pathogenesis. Specifically, ocular inflammation recently observed in EVD survivors is thought to involve direct viral infection, inflammation, and tissue edema. Future research is needed to understand the timing of uveitis onset and management strategies, including the role of antiviral and anti-inflammatory therapies.",16,2018-1-1

An update on the percentage of my patients showing the UGH syndrome associated with the Mark VIII anterior chamber lens implant as manufactured by Surgidev is given. Of seven patients having the syndrome sufficiently severe to warrant removal of the offending lens, six have now been reimplanted, two each with Rayner, IOLAB, and PC lenses. Whereas, other physicians have observed a similar UGH syndrome associated with iris chafing and erosions, this process was not particularly apparent in my cases involving the Surgidev lens. As for the chafing phenomenon, one could logically assume that it could be in large part eliminated by significantly increasing the curvature of the lens and simply vault the iris to a greater degree than is obtainable with lenses currently on the market. Perhaps too much emphasis has been placed on avoiding the endothelium and not enough emphasis on avoiding the iris.",16,1978-Apr-1

Subcutaneous (s.c.) immunization of rats with the human 60-kDa heat shock protein (HSP)-derived peptide 336-351 induced clinical and/or histological uveitis in 80 % of rats. Subsequent experiments to prevent the development of uveitis by oral or nasal administration of the peptide have failed. Instead, uveitis was induced in 74.6 % of rats given the peptide orally (5 times), in 75 % given the peptide nasally (5 times) or 91.7 % of those administered the peptide by both routes (10 times). Histological examination showed that any one route of administration of the peptide elicited iridocyclitis in 42.2 % but loss of photoreceptors only in 4.9 % of rats. In contrast, sequential administrations of the peptide by a combined mucosal-s.c. route resulted in iridocyclitis in only 25 % but loss of photoreceptors in 40 % of animals. Examination of mRNA from CD4-enriched splenic cells by reverse transcription-PCR failed to yield significant differences in Th1 or Th2 cytokines. Treatment with monoclonal antibody (mAb) to CD4 yielded a dose-dependent decrease in uveitis from 82 % to 25 %. Similarly, treatment with IL-4 significantly decreased the development of uveitis from 68 % to 30.4 %. Conversely, treatment of the rats with mAb to CD8 greatly enhanced the onset of uveitis (from about 22 days in the controls to 11 days) and all the rats developed uveitis by day 24. Thus, CD4+ cells mediate, whereas CD8+ cells suppress the development of uveitis. We suggest that this novel experimental mucosal model of induction of uveitis by the human 60-kDa HSP-derived peptide 336-351, which is specific in stimulating T cell responses in Behcet's disease, is consistent with the oro-genital onset of this disease and the development of uveitis.",16,1998-Aug-1

To report visual outcomes and complication rates associated with one-stage surgery for the management of uveitic cataract associated with posterior segment disease.
METHODS: In this interventional case series, 19 eyes (19 patients) with posterior segment involvement due to chronic uveitis underwent sutureless scleral tunnel incision phacoemulsification combined with total vitrectomy using 25-gauge instruments and posterior chamber intraocular lens (PC-IOL) implantation. Membrane peeling and endolaser photocoagulation were performed when indicated. Outcome measures were visual acuity, inflammatory activity, macular edema, and complications of surgery.
RESULTS: After a minimum 12-month follow-up, visual acuity was >or=20/100 in 12 eyes (63.2%); 6 eyes (31.6%) had visual acuity of >or=20/40. A decrease in postoperative inflammatory activity of 1 grade was observed in 8 eyes (42.1%). Sixteen eyes had cystoid macular edema before surgery; and 12 eyes had cystoid macular edema after surgery. Early postoperative complications included the following: transient corneal edema, 10 eyes (50.3%); fibrin reaction, 3 eyes (15.8%), and posterior synechiae, 9 eyes (47.3%). Glaucoma was the most common late postoperative complication (3 eyes [18.8%]). Nine eyes (47.4%) needed YAG laser capsulotomy during the first year.
CONCLUSION: Sutureless combined 25-gauge total vitrectomy, phacoemulsification, and PC-IOL implantation may be well tolerated with an acceptable complication rate for selected uveitic eyes with significant cataract and coexisting posterior segment disease for restoring useful vision.",16,2008-1-1

To investigate the anti-inflammatory effect of an adenosine monophosphate (AMP) analog, aminoimidazole carboxamide ribonucleotide (AICAR), in experimental autoimmune uveoretinitis (EAU).
METHODS: C57BL/6 mice were injected daily with AICAR (200 mg/kg, intraperitoneally [IP]) from day 0, the day of interphotoreceptor retinoid-binding protein (IRBP) immunization, until day 21. The severity of uveitis was assessed clinically and histopathologically. T-cell proliferation and cytokine production of IFN-γ, IL-17, and IL-10 in response to IRBP stimulation were determined. In addition, regulatory T-cell (Treg) populations were measured. Co-stimulatory molecule expression (CD40, 80, 86, and I-Ab) on dendritic cells (DCs) in EAU and on bone marrow-derived dendritic cells (BMDCs) treated with AICAR was measured.
RESULTS: AICAR treatment significantly reduced clinical and histologic severity of EAU as well as ocular cytokine production. An anti-inflammatory effect associated with the inhibition of T-cell proliferation and Th1 and Th17 cytokine production was observed. Increases in the Th2 response and Treg population were not observed with AICAR treatment. AICAR did significantly inhibit BMDC maturation by reducing co-stimulatory molecule expression.
CONCLUSIONS: AICAR attenuates EAU by preventing generation of Ag-specific Th1 and Th17 cells. Impaired DC maturation may be an underlying mechanism for this anti-inflammatory effect observed with AICAR.",16,2012-Jun-28

To perform a prospective pilot study to evaluate interferon alfa-2a (IFN alfa-2a) for the treatment of refractory cystoid macular edema (CME) in endogenous uveitis.
METHODS: IFN alfa-2a was administered at an initial dose of 3 or 6 million IU (depending on body weight) per day subcutaneously. Afterwards IFN alfa-2a was tapered slowly over 6 months and finally discontinued. If CME relapsed IFN alfa-2a was reinstituted and tapered slowly again to evaluate the lowest maintenance dose to keep remission.
RESULTS: A total of 15 eyes of 8 patients with refractory CME due to intermediate or posterior uveitis were included. Ineffective pretreatment consisted of systemic steroids and acetazolamide (all patients) and at least one additional immunosuppressant (6 patients). Six of 8 patients (11 eyes) responded well to IFN alfa-2a and CME resolved completely during 6 months treatment. One patient was lost to follow-up after IFN alfa-2a was stopped. In 1 patient (1 eye) even 19 months after cessation of IFN alfa-2a no recurrence of CME occurred. In 4 patients (8 eyes) IFN alfa-2a had to be reinstituted because CME relapsed. All 4 patients responded again. During a mean follow-up period of 16.4 months since restart of therapy we succeeded in all 4 patients to taper IFN alfa-2a to maintenance doses between 1.5 million IU every second and every sixth day without a recurrence of CME in any of the 8 eyes.
CONCLUSION: IFN alfa-2a can be a treatment option for patients with otherwise treatment resistant uveitic CME.",16,2006-Sep-1

To analyze current understanding of the factors that contribute to raised intraocular pressure (IOP) in patients with uveitis.
METHODS: A pubmed literature review was carried out using words including ""uveitic glaucoma"", ""IOP AND uveitis"", ""ocular hypertension AND uveitis"", ""inflammation AND glaucoma"", ""aqueous dynamics"" AND ""glaucoma/uveitis"".
RESULTS: Of the two studies looking at the aqueous dynamics in experimentally induced uveitis, both found aqueous flow decreased acutely, and one found that uveoscleral outflow increased. This is likely to reflect the types of uveitis that present acutely with hypotony. A study examining patients with Fuch's heterochromic cyclitis found no difference in aqueous flow or uveoscleral outflow. No studies have examined aqueous dynamics in types of uveitis that present with acutely raised IOP. Levels of prostaglandins rise in acute uveitis, which has been shown to increase uveoscleral and trabecular outflow, without affecting aqueous flow. Studies have demonstrated that raised levels of trabecular protein reduce trabecular outflow. Steroid treatment, inflammatory cells, free radicals and enzymes are also likely to contribute to the development of raised pressure. When considering the impact of the pathogenesis of raised pressure in uveitis on its treatment, prostaglandins may provide good intraocular pressure control, but there are concerns regarding their theoretical ability to worsen the inflammatory response in uveitis. Studies have not conclusively proven this to be the case. Surgical success rates vary, but trabeculectomy plus an antimetabolite, deep sclerectomy plus an antimetabolite, and Ahmed valve surgery have been used.
CONCLUSIONS: Uveitic glaucoma is caused by a number of different diseases, some of which present with acute hypotony, others with acutely raised IOP, and others which demonstrate an increase in IOP over time. Further studies should be carried out to examine the differing pathogenesis in these types of diseases, and to establish the best treatment options.",16,2016-1-1

To describe the usefulness of chest computerized tomography (CT) in the evaluation of uveitis in elderly women and the clinical characteristics of patients with an abnormal chest CT scan.
DESIGN: Prospective noncomparative case series.
METHODS: We evaluated 30 elderly women, aged 61-83 years, with chronic iritis, vitritis, or choroiditis and with no definitive cause for their uveitis. All patients underwent a battery of diagnostic laboratory studies and chest CT.
RESULTS: The diagnostic examination in most patients included serum angiotensin converting enzyme level, serum lysozyme, rapid plasma reagin level, fluorescent treponemal antibody-absorption test, purified protein derivative skin test, and chest x-rays. Chest CT performed on all patients showed parenchymal, mediastinal, and/or hilar adenopathy in 17 patients (57%). Histopathologic confirmation of sarcoidosis with noncaseating granulomas in the biopsy specimens was obtained in 14 patients: eight by mediastinoscopy, two by bronchoscopy, two by conjunctival biopsy, one by nasal biopsy, and one by vitreous biopsy.
CONCLUSIONS: Chest CT can be useful in elderly female patients with chronic uveitis for identifying mediastinal lymphadenopathy and other lesions suggestive of sarcoidosis, as well as to help guide tissue confirmation and to rule out other diagnoses including lymphoma.",16,2002-Apr-1

Members of the adeno-associated virus (AAV) family are good candidates for the treatment of ocular diseases because of their relative lack of pathogenicity. We studied the effect of intraocular injection of AAV2-viral IL-10 (vIL-10) on retinal S-antigen-induced experimental autoimmune uveoretinitis (EAU) in Lewis rats. We demonstrated that AAV2/2-GFP injected into the vitreous body transduced the iris and ciliary body, or anterior uvea, and the retina. We showed that intravitreal injection of the AAV2/2-tetON-vIL-10 construct achieved detectable levels of vIL-10 mRNA and protein within the eye and was effective in protecting the rat retina against destruction. This protection was dependent on the level of vIL-10 present in the aqueous humor/ vitreous body. Intravitreal injection of the same construct encased within an AAV5 shell, AAV2/5-tetONvIL- 10, did not confer any degree of protection. It appeared that the AAV2/5 vectors did not transduce the anterior uvea, the site at which inflammatory cells first localize in EAU, nor the ganglion cell layer; induced low expression of vIL-10 mRNA; and did not achieve detectable levels of transgene expression in the aqueous humor/vitreous body. Local treatment with AAV2/2-tetON-vIL-10 did not dampen the systemic immune response, as determined by S-antigen-specific lymphocyte proliferation. Our results show that local intravitreal injection of AAV2/2 is an effective means by which to deliver immunoregulatory molecules into the eye during uveitis, a chronic human ocular disease.",16,2005-Sep-1

Fuchs' heterochromic iridocyclitis (FHI), an unusual form of uveitis of unknown etiology, is frequently misdiagnosed.
PURPOSE: To report the analysis of 26 patients (27 eyes) with FHI who were diagnosed and observed over a period of 1-7 years (mean: 3.42 +/- 2.2 years).
METHODS: Ocular and systemic examinations were performed on all patients.
RESULTS: The most common presenting symptom was visual deterioration (42.3%); one patient was affected bilaterally. Characteristic keratic precipitates (100%), cataracts (77.8%), and heterochromia (70.4%) were the major signs. Eleven eyes (40.7%) required cataract surgery. At the initial examination, four eyes (14.8%) had glaucoma, and no new cases of glaucoma developed during the follow-up period. One eye required filtration surgery. Vitrectomy was performed in two eyes (7.4%) because of vitreous opacities. Most patients (73.0%) did not require active treatment; pre- and postoperative anti-inflammatory treatment for cataract extraction was performed successfully to minimize the risk of inflammation. No severe uveitis was seen in any patient after surgery, but visual acuity did not improve greatly after cataract extraction; 54.5% eyes had visual acuity better than 20/40 before surgery, and 45.4% postoperatively.
CONCLUSION: Posterior capsule opacification, glaucoma, and vitreous opacity were the major obstacles to visual rehabilitation after cataract surgery in patients with this type of uveitis.",16,2001-Sep-1

Uveitis is a serious inflammatory disease of the uvea, frequently leading to visual impairment and irreversible blindness. Here, we investigated the anti-inflammatory effect of minocycline on rat endotoxin-induced uveitis (EIU) and retinal inflammation.
METHODS: For in vivo studies, the rat EIU model was induced with intravitreal injection of lipopolysaccharide (LPS). Minocycline was administered intraperitoneally 2 h before and after the LPS injection. The severity of the ocular inflammation was evaluated with slit-lamp photography, aqueous humor cell counting, protein quantitative determination, and histological analysis. Retinal microglia were labeled with a fluorescent dye 4Di-10ASP. Microglial activity and inflammatory cytokine production were analyzed with immunofluorescence and real-time PCR. For the in vitro studies, BV-2 microglia cells were stimulated with LPS or cotreated with minocycline for 6 h. Toll-like receptor (TLR) 2/4 levels were determined with real-time PCR and western blotting.
RESULTS: The LPS-challenged eyes displayed severe inflammation in all ocular structures, including a large number of anterior chamber cells, fibrin exudation, hypopyon, and infiltrated inflammatory cells in the vitreous and retina. Immunostaining of the retinal whole-mounts also revealed numerous retinal microglia were activated promptly, and then more and more peripheral leukocytes were recruited and infiltrated in the LPS-injected retinas. Additionally, the production of tumor necrosis factor-α (TNF-α), chemokine (C-C motif) ligand 2 (CCL-2), interleukin-1 beta (IL-1β), and IL-6 was dramatically increased. However, minocycline treatment strongly inhibited microglia activation, decreased inflammatory cytokine production, prevented peripheral inflammatory cell recruitment, and significantly attenuated ocular inflammation. Finally, we demonstrated the mechanism of the microglia inactivation effect of minocycline is via suppression of TLR4 signaling.
CONCLUSIONS: This study indicates minocycline is far beyond an antibiotic. It not only attenuates rat EIU but also inhibits retinal inflammation through inactivating microglia, inhibiting inflammatory cell recruitment and inflammatory cytokine production.",16,2019-1-1

To examine the efficacy of the immunomodulatory drug fingolimod (FTY720) as a rescue therapy for noninfectious intraocular inflammation.
METHODS: Experimental autoimmune uveoretinitis, the murine correlate of human uveitis, was induced in B10.RIII mice. The mice were treated with 2 oral doses of fingolimod daily, either during early ocular infiltration or following clinical onset of the disease. At subsequent times, retinal infiltrates were examined and enumerated using flow cytometry, and structural disease was assessed and scored using histology.
RESULTS: Fingolimod treatment, administered 2 days before disease onset, prevented inflammatory cells from infiltrating the retina, with corroborative suppression of histologic disease. A single dose of fingolimod was sufficient in clearing infiltrating leukocytes from the retina within 2 hours of treatment. Furthermore, a single dose of fingolimod administered after disease onset not only abolished retinal infiltrates but also prevented disease relapse for at least 3 weeks.
CONCLUSIONS: A short-term, high-dose treatment with fingolimod rapidly reduces ocular infiltrates in experimental autoimmune uveoretinitis, leading to a normal myeloid cell count within the retina. When given at the early stages of intraocular inflammation, fingolimod resolves disease. Clinical Relevance This study directly demonstrates the therapeutic potential of fingolimod and an acute rescue intervention for human noninfectious posterior-segment intraocular inflammatory disease.",16,2008-Oct-1

The aim of this study was to investigate the effects of palmitoylethanolamide (PEA), an endogenous fatty acid amide belonging to the family of the N-acylethanolamines (NAEs), in rats subjected to endotoxin-induced uveitis (EIU). EIU was induced in male rats by a single footpad injection of 200μg lipopolysaccharide (LPS). PEA was administered intraperitoneally at 1h before and 7h after injection of LPS. Another group of animals was treated with vehicle. Dexamethasone (DEX) was administered as a positive control. Rats were sacrificed 16h after injection and the eyes tissues were collected for histology, immunohistochemical and western blot analyses. The histological evaluation of the iris-ciliary body showed an increase of neutrophilic infiltration and nuclear modification of vessel of endothelial cells. PEA treatment decreased the inflammatory cell infiltration and improved histological damage of eye tissues. In addition, PEA treatment reduced pro-inflammatory tumor necrosis factor (TNF-α) levels, protein extravasion and lipid peroxidation. Immunohistochemical analysis for intracellular adhesion molecule (ICAM)-1 and nitrotyrosine showed a positive staining from LPS-injected rats. The degree of staining for ICAM-1 and nitrotyrosine was significantly reduced in eye sections from LPS-injected rats treated with PEA. In addition, an increase of inducible nitric oxide synthase (iNOS) and nuclear factor (NF-κB) was also evaluated in inflammed ocular tissues by western blot. PEA strongly inhibited iNOS expression and nuclear NF-κB translocation. Thus, in this study we demonstrated that PEA reduces the degree of ocular inflammation in a rat model of EIU.",16,2015-Aug-15

To evaluate the clinical experience with methotrexate as a first-line corticosteroid-sparing drug in patients with resistant ocular inflammation.
METHODS: We retrospectively studied 39 consecutive patients with uveitis (n = 36) or scleritis (n = 3) who were treated with methotrexate following inadequate control with corticosteroids lasting five years. Criteria for initiating treatment with methotrexate and defining outcome were strictly defined.
RESULTS: The cohort included 21 females and 18 males, all Caucasians, with a mean age of 26.6 years (range: 3-73 years). Patients were followed up for 21.5 +/- 12.6 months. Treatment was discontinued due to side effects in 10 patients (26%). Of the remaining 29 patients, full or partial control of inflammation was achieved in 23 (79%). Response to treatment was observed after a mean of 2.4 +/- 0.8 months. Ten patients were fully controlled and discontinued methotrexate therapy after a mean of 20.9 +/- 9.2 months, with no recurrence of inflammation. Use of topical and systemic corticosteroids was markedly reduced in responsive patients.
CONCLUSIONS: Methotrexate is recommended as a first-line adjunct to or replacement of systemic corticosteroids in the treatment of ocular inflammation.",15,2003-Jun-1

Ocular inflammation resolved and visual acuity improved in all patients after treatment.
CONCLUSIONS: A diagnosis of ocular syphilis should be considered in any patient with visual loss associated with a rash or headache, irrespective of the patient's CD4 cell count. Ocular syphilis in HIV-positive patients should be treated as neurosyphilis, whereas ocular syphilis in non-HIV patients can be treated as secondary syphilis.",15,2007-Aug-1

PMID: 33845016
To determine classification criteria for multifocal choroiditis with panuveitis (MFCPU).
DESIGN: Machine learning of cases with MFCPU and 8 other posterior uveitides.
METHODS: Cases of posterior uveitides were collected in an informatics-designed preliminary database, and a final database was constructed of cases achieving supermajority agreement on diagnosis, using formal consensus techniques. Cases were split into a training set and a validation set. Machine learning using multinomial logistic regression was used on the training set to determine a parsimonious set of criteria that minimized the misclassification rate among the posterior uveitides. The resulting criteria were evaluated on the validation set.
RESULTS: One thousand sixty-eight cases of posterior uveitides, including 138 cases of MFCPU, were evaluated by machine learning. Key criteria for MFCPU included (1) multifocal choroiditis with the predominant lesions size >125 µm in diameter; (2) lesions outside the posterior pole (with or without posterior involvement); and either (3) punched-out atrophic chorioretinal scars or (4) more than minimal mild anterior chamber and/or vitreous inflammation. Overall accuracy for posterior uveitides was 93.9% in the training set and 98.0% (95% confidence interval 94.3, 99.3) in the validation set. The misclassification rates for MFCPU were 15% in the training set and 0% in the validation set.
CONCLUSIONS: The criteria for MFCPU had a reasonably low misclassification rate and seemed to perform sufficiently well for use in clinical and translational research.",15,2021-Aug-1

To determine the long-term visual and systemic outcomes of uveitis patients with biopsy-proven sarcoidosis.
METHODS: A retrospective study of biopsy-proven sarcoid uveitis, with a 3-year minimum follow-up, seen at Lyon University Hospital, between April 2004 and January 2016.
RESULTS: A total of 83 patients were included, with a median age at onset of 52 (37-62) years and an unbalanced gender ratio (women 77.1%). Thirty-one patients had original systemic sarcoidosis in addition to ocular localisation, whereas 52 initially presented with isolated sarcoid uveitis. Among the latter, 7.7% (n=4) developed an extraocular disease after a median follow-up duration of 60 (44-110) months. The systemic spread in these patients included cutaneous sarcoids (n=2), arthritis (n=1) and multiple mononeuritis (n=1). Complete visual recovery was obtained for 60.2% of all patients and 89.2% had retrieved best-corrected visual acuity (BCVA) >20/50 in both eyes. A unilateral loss of BCVA of worse than 20/200 was documented in two patients in the isolated sarcoid uveitis group. No patient suffered from bilateral severe visual impairment or blindness. Factors linked to a poor visual prognosis, defined by BCVA ≤20/50 in at least one eye, were chronic macular oedema (p=0.009) and persistent ocular inflammation (p=0.0005).
CONCLUSIONS: In this large European series of biopsy-proven sarcoidosis to date, with a prolonged follow-up, sarcoid uveitis was suggestive of a favourable systemic and visual outcome. Clinically isolated uveitis that revealed sarcoidosis remained a strictly ocular condition in most cases.",15,2017-Jul-1

Vogt-Koyanagi (V-K) syndrome is a severe anterior uveitis associated with alopecia, vitiligo, poliosis, and dysacousia. Harada's disease (HD) is primarily a posterior uveitis accompanied by signs of meningeal irritation and abnormalities of the cerebrospinal fluid. The overlapping of clinical manifestations between the two justified considering them as part of a spectrum of one disease (V-K-H). In a clinicopathologic study of nine cases four patients (three with V-K syndrome and one with V-K-H syndrome) histopathologically displayed a granulomatous uveitis. Five patients (two with V-K syndrome and three with HD) showed a nongranulomatous uveitis. We emphasized this latter finding, since in the past the diagnosis of this syndrome has been discarded both clinically and histopathologically because of the absence of a granulomatous uveitis. We established the clinical and histopathologic differences between V-K-H and sympathetic ophthalmia. The designation ""uveomeningoencephalitic syndrome"" stresses the key features of V-K-H, namely the uveal involvement and signs of meningeal irritation (that is, headaches, personality changes, and cerebrospinal fluid alterations).",15,1977-Feb-1

To describe the epidemiology of macular edema (ME) in patients with uveitis.
METHODS: Review of articles listed on PubMed pertaining to uveitic ME.
RESULTS: Reported rates of uveitic ME ranging from 20% to 70%, depending on the ancillary tests used (fundus examination, fluorescein angiography, optical coherence tomography). Macular edema might develop due to uveitis itself, or occur as an adverse effect of drugs taken for different diseases. It is more frequently observed in adults than in children, in chronic uveitis, and in intermediate uveitis. Males with ankylosing spondylitis are more prone to develop ME than females. Three patterns of uveitic ME are observed, either isolated or in combination: cystoid ME, the most frequently encountered pattern seen in up to 80% of cases, diffuse ME and serous retinal detachment.
CONCLUSION: Older age, chronicity of uveitis and intermediate uveitis are risk factors for the development of ME in patients with uveitis.",15,2019-1-1

To describe recent evidence from the literature pertaining to juvenile idiopathic arthritis (JIA)-associated uveitis.
RECENT FINDINGS: Uveitis is most common in extended oligoarticular JIA. A significant number of patients already have ocular complications at time of diagnosis of uveitis. Risk factors for complications include either abnormally high or low intraocular pressure, posterior synechiae, male sex, temporal proximity to diagnosis of arthritis and topical corticosteroid use. Use of immunosuppressive agents significantly reduces ocular complications. Aggressive perioperative control of intraocular inflammation is necessary for successful cataract surgery with lens implantation. Controlled clinical trials are under way to assess the efficacy of biologic agents in JIA-associated uveitis. Long-term safety, however, is still unknown.
SUMMARY: JIA-associated uveitis carries significant ocular morbidity that lasts well into adulthood. Treatment with immunosuppressive agents can reduce the risk of ocular complications. Biologic agents hold promise in the treatment of JIA-associated uveitis, but require long-term data to assess their safety.",15,2010-Nov-1

Intraocular inflammatory eye disease is one of the important causes of ocular morbidity. Even though the prevalence of uveitis is less common in relation to diabetic retinopathy, glaucoma or age related macular degeneration, the complexity and heterogeneity of the disease makes it more unique. Putative uveitogenic retinal antigens incite innate immunity by the process of antigen mimicry and have been shown to be associated in patients with intraocular inflammatory disease by numerous experimental studies. Laboratory diagnostic tools to aid the etiologic association in intraocular inflammatory disease have evolved over the last two decades and we are entering into an era of molecular diagnostic tests. Sophisticated novel technologies such as multiplex bead assays to assess biological signatures have revolutionized the management of complex refractory uveitis. Nevertheless, there is still a long way to go to establish the causal relationship between these biomarkers and specific uveitic entities. Experimental studies have shown the supreme role of infliximab in the management of Behcet's disease. Despite significant experimental and case control studies, the deficiency of randomized clinical trials using these biologic agents has handicapped us in exploring them as a front line therapy in severe refractory uveitis. Studies still need to answer the safety of these potentially life threatening drugs in a selected group of patients and determine when to commence and for how long the treatment has to be given. This review article covers some basic concepts of cytokines in uveitis and their potential application for therapy in refractory uveitis.",15,2014-Jan-1

Multidisciplinary management in the diagnosis and management of patients with ocular inflammatory disease is often critical. The workup of uveitis or scleritis may reveal an underlying systemic disease. Recognition of inflammation by the primary care physician can facilitate prompt referral to a uveitis specialist and improve patient outcomes. The primary care physician can assist the ophthalmologist in monitoring for potential side effects of corticosteroids and immunosuppressive drugs, including the newer biologic agents. The ophthalmologist in turn can assist the primary care physician in recognizing that active uveitis may suggest incomplete control of preexisting conditions.",15,2015-Sep-1

To determine whether a fluocinolone acetonide sustained-release intravitreal drug delivery system can be implanted safely at the same time that a glaucoma drainage device is placed for eyes with uveitis and elevated intraocular pressure (IOP) receiving maximum tolerated IOP-lowering therapy.
DESIGN: Retrospective, observational case series.
METHODS: Subjects had chronic noninfectious intermediate or posterior uveitis and elevated IOP while receiving maximum tolerated medical therapy. Fluocinolone acetonide implantation and glaucoma tube shunt placement were performed in a single surgical session. The main outcome measures were inflammatory recurrences, visual acuity (VA), use of adjunctive anti-inflammatory therapy, IOP, and adverse events.
RESULTS: Seven eyes of 5 patients were studied. The average number of recurrences 12 months before implantation was 3 episodes per eye; of the 3 eyes followed up for more than 30 months, none had an inflammatory recurrence within 30 months after implantation. The mean Snellen visual acuity 12 months after the combined surgery was 20/114, compared with 20/400 at baseline. Adjunctive steroid use decreased. Average IOP decreased from 27.3 mm Hg at baseline to 14.6 mm Hg 12 months after the combined surgery (P = .019).
CONCLUSIONS: The favorable results observed in all eyes suggest that fluocinolone acetonide implantation can be safely combined with glaucoma tube shunt placement in a single surgical session in eyes with uveitis and elevated IOP receiving maximum tolerated IOP-lowering therapy. Uveitis recurrences decreased, visual acuity improved, and IOP decreased. There were no adverse events during insertion of the fluocinolone acetonide implant and placement of the glaucoma tube shunt.",15,2010-May-1

Blau syndrome is characterized by noncaseating granulomatous arthritis, dermatitis, and uveitis, and results from gain-of-function NOD2 mutations. This study was undertaken to identify the genetic cause of the disease in a family with 3 members with Blau syndrome.
METHODS: We studied a family with 3 affected members across 2 consecutive generations. The children's symptoms started early (at 6 and 7 months of age) and included polyarthritis, dermatitis, uveitis, and fever. In contrast, the father's symptoms started later (at 22 years of age) and included noncaseating granulomatous dermatitis and uveitis. We analyzed the NOD2 gene in all patients by both the Sanger method of DNA sequencing and amplicon-based deep sequencing using an Ion Torrent PGM platform.
RESULTS: Sanger chromatograms revealed the heterozygous c.1001G>A transition in both children, which resulted in the p.Arg334Gln mutation that causes Blau syndrome. In contrast, the father's chromatograms revealed a small peak of adenine at the c.1001 position, suggesting the presence of a somatic NOD2 mutation. To evaluate this hypothesis, we performed amplicon-based deep sequencing using DNA from different tissues, which confirmed a variable degree (0.9-12.9%) of somatic NOD2 mosaicism. The previous detection of the NOD2 mutation in his daughters strongly suggests the presence of gonosomal (somatic plus gonadal) NOD2 mosaicism in the father. Comparative analyses with Blau syndrome patients carrying the germline p.Arg334Gln NOD2 mutation revealed late onset of the disease, a mild inflammatory phenotype, and an absence of complications in patients with NOD2 mosaicism.
CONCLUSION: This is the first description of gonosomal NOD2 mosaicism as the cause of intrafamilial recurrence of Blau syndrome. Our findings also indicate that Blau syndrome includes more diverse and milder phenotypes than previously described.",15,2016-Apr-1

To define the clinical characteristics and optical coherence tomographic (OCT) features, and to assess the outcome of treatment, in patients with presumed tuberculous uveitis (PTU).
METHODS: All patients diagnosed with PTU at King Abdulaziz University Hospital between January 1998 and May 2006 were reviewed. The diagnosis was made when findings were consistent with possible intraocular tuberculosis with no other cause of uveitis suggested by history, symptoms, or ancillary testing, strongly positive tuberculin skin-test results, and response to antituberculous therapy.
RESULTS: Fifty-one patients (73 eyes) were identified. There were 34 males (66.7%) and 17 females (33.3%) with a mean age of 40.1+/-11.0 years (range 16-68 years). Fifty-eight eyes (79.5%) had panuveitis and 15 eyes (20.5%) had posterior uveitis at presentation. Clinical manifestations included vitritis (71.2%), macular edema (63%), retinal periphlebitis (35.6%), multifocal choroiditis (20.5%), and granulomatous anterior uveitis (17.9%). All patients received antituberculous therapy and systemic corticosteroids. After a mean follow-up of 18.9+/-21.9 months (range 6-96 months), all eyes showed resolution of inflammation, with no recurrences, associated with significant improvement in visual acuity (VA) (P=0.007). There was a significant positive correlation between initial and final VAs (r=0.7856, P<0.001). Thirty-one eyes with macular edema were examined at baseline and at follow-up with OCT. There were three patterns of macular edema: diffuse (DME) (28.5%), cystoid (29%), and serous retinal detachment (45.2%). Initial VA of 20/40 or better was significantly associated with central macular thickness (CMT) of 300 microm or less (P=0.0065) and DME (0.0484). At final follow-up, there was a significant reduction in CMT (P<0.001) associated with a significant improvement in VA (P=0.0091).
CONCLUSIONS: Antituberculous therapy combined with systemic corticosteroids leads to resolution of inflammation and elimination of recurrences of PTU. OCT is useful in monitoring the efficacy of treatment in patients with macular edema.",15,2008-Dec-1

The therapeutic efficacy of rapamycin conjugated monomethoxy poly(ethylene glycol)-poly(ε-caprolactone) (MPEG-PCL) micelles (rapamycin micelles) was evaluated in a rat experimental autoimmune uveitis (EAU) model. Rapamycin micelles exhibited spherical morphology and had a mean particle size of 40nm and a zeta-potential of -0.89mv. The water solubility of rapamycin improved by more than 1000-fold in a micellar formulation. Intravitreal injection of MPEG-PCL micelles did not result in vitreous hemorrhage or retinal detachment. Fluorescence microscopy demonstrated that labeled micelles localized to the retinal pigment epithelium for at least 14 days following injection and the drug concentration of rapamycin micelles in the retinal tissue was significantly higher than unconjugated rapamycin over this period. At the optimal concentration of rapamycin micelles (9μg/eye), clinical signs of EAU were abolished via the downregulation of the Th1 and Th17 response. There were no significant difference in T cell proliferation and delayed-type hypersensitivity between the treatment and control groups, suggesting that the therapeutic effect of rapamycin manifested locally in the eye and not systemically. These results indicate that intravitreal injection of rapamycin micelles is a promising therapy for controlling sterile intraocular inflammation.",15,2016-Nov-20

To report the presentations of syphilitic uveitides in Singapore.
METHODS: Retrospective noncomparative observational case series of 18 eyes from 12 patients with ocular syphilis between 2004 and 2009.
RESULTS: Patients were mainly male (91.7%). Median age was 49.5 (24-84) years. Initial visual acuity varied from 6/6 to counting fingers (CF) and was ≥6/12 in 7 eyes (38.8%). Blurring of vision (n = 11, 61.1%) was the most common presenting complaint. Anterior uveitis and panuveitis were both most common (n = 6, 33.3%). Treponemal and nontreponemal serologies were positive in 12 (100.0%) and 10 (83.3%) patients, respectively. Patients were treated systematically with penicillin therapy by infectious disease physicians.
CONCLUSIONS: Ocular syphilis is seeing a worldwide resurgence. Although anterior uveitis and panuveitis were most common in this study, there was a large spectrum of ocular manifestations. Syphilitic uveitides can potentially cause severe loss of vision but are effectively treated by an appropriate regimen of penicillin.",15,2014-Feb-1

Purified human retinal S-antigen (S-ag) was used to investigate the occurrence of humoral and cellular autoimmune reactions against S-ag in uveitis patients. With a sensitive ELISA method anti-S-ag antibodies could be detected in the sera of 28% of the uveitis patients. No difference was found between patients with posterior or panuveitis (31 out of 117 positive) and patients with anterior or intermediate uveitis (16 out of 52 positive). Similar frequencies and levels of anti-S-ag autoantibodies were also found among healthy controls (6/20) and patients who had undergone cataract surgery (6/17). Immunoblotting with purified S-ag and with whole human retinal extract confirmed the presence of anti-S-ag antibodies in uveitis and control sera. Moreover, antibodies against various other retinal proteins could also be demonstrated in patients and controls, without being particularly enhanced in uveitis. The cellular immune responsiveness was tested by measuring the production of migration inhibitory factor (MIF) during overnight culture of peripheral mononuclear cells with the antigen. None of 18 healthy controls responded, whereas 17 positive reactions were observed in the group of 44 uveitis patients. The highest frequencies were found in patients with posterior (5/12) or pan- (7/12) uveitis, while of the responders with anterior (2/8) or intermediate (3/12) uveitis, three had disorders affecting the retina. Thus, cellular autoimmune responsiveness to S-ag is apparently associated with posterior and pan-uveitis, and might also occur in non-uveitic retinal disorders, whereas the occurrence of anti-S-ag antibodies is probably not at all pathognomic for uveitis.",15,1987-Jul-1

The mutations of CARD15 gene and clinical features of Chinese patients with Blau syndrome were analyzed. We identified 10 missense mutations, out of which five were new: R334L, E383D, R471C, C495R and D512F. The rest of them, R334W, R334Q, G481D, M513T and R587C, have been reported previously. Among all the mutations, R334W, R334Q and C495R had the highest frequency. Blau syndrome was found at early age after birth. It began with lepidic rash and symmetric polyarthritis and was phenotypically characterized by typical rash, arthritis, iridocyclitis and arteritis. Cardiac involvement was also found in Blau syndrome. In addition to nerve deafness, renal involvement, osteochondroma and central nervous system involvement were also found in our patients. Therefore, Chinese children with Blau syndrome have unique gene mutations and complicated clinical phenotypes.

To determine if two different doses of intravitreal sirolimus, an mTOR inhibitor, can decrease inflammation and is safe in eyes with non-infectious posterior, intermediate, or panuveitis in the Sirolimus as a Therapeutic Approach UVEitis: Protocol-2 (SAVE-2) Study.
METHODS: SAVE-2 is a prospective randomized, phase II, open-label interventional clinical trial conducted at 4 clinical centers in the United States. Eligible subjects were randomized into one of two treatments. Group 1 received 440µg of intravitreal sirolimus in study eyes on days 0, 30, 60, 90, 120, and 150; group 2 received 880µg of intravitreal sirolimus on days 0, 60, and 120. Fellow eyes were also eligible to receive sirolimus (of opposite dose to that of study eye). Primary endpoint of the study was at month 6 (M6).
RESULTS: 24 subjects have been randomized in SAVE-2 and are included in the analysis. Vitreous haze decreased by ≥2 steps in 63.6% and 50% of patients in groups 1 and 2, respectively at M6 (p=0.695). Mean change in best-corrected visual acuity for subjects was +3.66 and -2.91 ETDRS letters in group 1 and 2, respectively. Among subjects with macular edema at baseline (n=13), the mean change in foveal thickness was -89.42µm in group 1 and +81.5µm in group 2 at M6.
CONCLUSIONS: Both low and high doses of intravitreal sirolimus were found to decrease vitreous haze in eyes with non-infectious uveitis. Low dose (440µg) sirolimus administered monthly may be more efficacious in reducing uveitic macular edema than high dose (880µg) administered every 2 months.",15,2016-Aug-1

Panuveitis is a generalized inflammation of not only the whole of the uveal tract but also involves the retina and vitreous humor. It differs from other anatomical sites of inflammation in terms of causes as well as distribution. The common causes of panuveitis in our population are tuberculosis, Vogt-Koyanagi-Harada syndrome, sympathetic ophthalmia, Behcet's disease and sarcoidosis. A large number of cases still remain idiopathic. A stepwise approach is essential while evaluating these patients to be able to identify and treat the disease timely and correctly. Ancillary tests can be appropriately applied once the anatomic site of inflammation is identified. An exhaustive approach comprising a full battery of tests is obsolete. Only specific tailored investigations are ordered as suggested by the preliminary clinical and ocular examination. The mainstay of the treatment of uveitis is corticosteroids. Immunosuppressive agents are administered if the inflammation is not adequately controlled with corticosteroids. One of the recent breakthroughs in the treatment of refractory uveitis includes the introduction of immunomodulating drugs: Tumor necrosis factor-alpha antagonist and Interferon-alpha. Vitrectomy has been used in uveitis for over a few decades for diagnostic and therapeutic purposes. When compared to other anatomical sites of inflammation, panuveitis has poor visual outcome due to more widespread inflammation. The side-effects of the chronic treatment that these patients receive cannot be overlooked and should be specifically monitored under the supervision of an internist with special interest in inflammatory diseases.",15,2010-1-1

Vasoactive intestinal peptide (VIP), a neuropeptide that is known to be present in lymphoid tissue microenvironments, shows prominent anti-inflammatory actions.
OBJECTIVE: To examine the potential effect of VIP on the development of experimental autoimmune uveoretinitis (EAU).
DESIGN: We immunized C57BL/6 mice with human interphotoreceptor retinoid-binding protein peptide 1-20 (h-IRBP peptide). Vasoactive intestinal peptide was administered intraperitoneally on alternate days until day 21 after immunization (entire group). In some cases, VIP was injected at different time points after the induction of immunity with h-IRBP peptide (efferent group). In each experiment, a control group of mice was injected with phosphate-buffered saline instead of VIP. Development of EAU was evaluated by means of histological examination on day 21 after immunization. Furthermore, we determined whether intravenous injection of peritoneal exudate cells cultured with VIP overnight in vitro abrogated EAU. We analyzed delayed hypersensitivity for h-IRBP peptide and the occurrence and severity of EAU using evaluation of histopathological sections for inflammatory ocular disease.
RESULTS: Treatment with VIP suppressed the expression of delayed hypersensitivity responses to h-IRBP peptide significantly (positive control vs entire group, P =.02; positive control vs efferent group, P<.001). Mice treated with VIP (n = 10) showed a lower occurrence (40%) and decreased severity of EAU (entire group mean score, 0.3; median score, 0) compared with untreated mice (occurrence, 80%; mean score, 0.85; median score, 0.75), as assessed by histopathological analyses (P =.049). Suppressive effects of VIP on EAU were also observed, even when VIP was administered on days 8 through 20 after immunization (efferent group [n = 9] occurrence, 11%; mean score, 0.1; median score, 0) (P =.003). Moreover, expression of EAU was significantly suppressed when the animals were pretreated with peritoneal exudate cells pulsed with h-IRBP in the presence of VIP (control mean score, 1.2; median score, 1.0; occurrence, 80% [n = 10]) compared with the VIP-treatment group (mean score, 0.3; median score, 0; occurrence, 30% [n = 10]) (P =.004). In addition, VIP-treated peritoneal exudate cells generated regulator T cells in the spleens of recipient mice that were able to interfere with the development of EAU (control group mean score, 0.5; median score, 0.5; occurrence, 63% [n = 8]) compared with the VIP-treatment group (mean score, 0.08; median score, 0; occurrence, 17% [n = 6]) (P =.08).
CONCLUSION: Treatment with VIP is a highly effective therapy to suppress EAU.
CLINICAL RELEVANCE: As a result of its efficacy in preventing EAU, VIP might be considered as a novel therapeutic modality for human uveitis.",15,2004-Aug-1

The association between multiple sclerosis (MS) and uveitis has been questioned. Nerve tissue and eye tissue develop from the same embryonic cells; thus, MS and uveitis could be etiologically associated. In published studies, the prevalence of MS in patients with uveitis differe from 0.7% to 30.4%, whereas the prevalence of uveitis in patients with MS differe from 0.65% to 36.7%. Based on the largest retrospective studies, the prevalence of uveitis among MS patients is ∼1%, and the prevalence of MS among patients with uveitis is ∼1%. This is considerably higher than in the general population; thus, more research on this topic is needed to further understand the relationship between MS and uveitis.",15,2017-1-1

To evaluate the safety and efficacy of intravitreal injection of liposomes encapsulating infliximab in experimental autoimmune uveoretinitis (EAU) rats.
METHODS: Liposomes containing infliximab were prepared and characterised for mean particle size, entrapment efficiency, polydispersity index (PDI) and zeta potential. In vitro release profile and the stability of infliximab-lip were evaluated. EAU rats were intravitreally injected with saline, infliximab, infliximab-lip or unloaded liposomes. Clinical signs and ocular histological sections were graded. Infliximab concentrations were determined with competitive ELISA. Safety of the intravitreal injections was evaluated by electroretinography (ERG) and histopathological examination. Retinal biodistribution and clearance of rhodamine-conjugated liposomes containing infliximab were evaluated with a laser scanning confocal microscope.
RESULTS: The mean particle size of infliximab liposomes was 351.3±58 nm and entrapment efficiency was 90.65%±2.68%. PDI and zeta potential of infliximab liposomes were 0.386 and -20.8±9.78 mV, respectively. Stability test data showed that the infliximab-lip was stable for 60 days at room temperature. In EAU rats, intravitreal injection of infliximab and infliximab-lip greatly reduced intraocular inflammation determined by clinical scores and histopathological analyses (n=4). The mean concentrations of infliximab decreased quickly in infliximab injection group and were lower than those in infliximab-lip injection group (n=4 eyes, p<0.05 after 3 days post injection). No retinal toxic effects were detected after intravitreal injection of infliximab-lip in ERG (n=4 rats, p>0.05) and histopathological sections compared with normal rats. Confocal microscopy showed that fluorescent liposomes were observed in almost every layer of the retina and remained detectable for >30 days after injection.
CONCLUSIONS: Intravitreal injection of liposomal infliximab can prolong the persistence of the drug in vitreous body and demonstrated a satisfactory safety and significant therapeutic potentials in EAU. The use of biodegradable particles for therapeutic antibody delivery may provide a promising approach for the treatment of ocular diseases.",15,2017-Dec-1

To describe the clinical course and treatment with immunomodulatory agents in patients with tubulointerstitial nephritis and uveitis syndrome.
METHODS: Retrospective analysis of the charts of six patients with tubulointerstitial nephritis and uveitis syndrome.
RESULTS: The mean (+/-SD) age was 24.3 (+/-16.5) years, range 13 to 49 years. Four patients were children, and two were adults. Three were men, and three were women. Five of the six patients had anterior uveitis, and one had panuveitis. All patients had several relapses despite treatment with topical, regional, and oral steroids and methotrexate in one case. The introduction or modification of immunosuppressants (methotrexate, azathioprine, or cyclosporin A) achieved control of the uveitis and prevented relapses over a mean (+/-SD) follow-up period of 19.66 (+/-10.01) months, range 6 to 34 months. No treatment-related side effects were observed.
CONCLUSIONS: Tubulointerstitial nephritis and uveitis syndrome is a distinct disease entity in which the nephritis typically resolves, but the uveitis often becomes chronic and is treatment resistant.

To identify the demographic and clinical characteristics, along with the frequency, of neoplastic masquerade syndromes in a tertiary uveitis clinic.
DESIGN: A retrospective observational cohort.
METHODS: Demographic and clinical data on all patients presenting to the National Eye Institute (NEI) with uveitis between 2004 and 2012 were used to compare neoplastic masquerade syndromes and uveitis.
RESULTS: A total of 853 patients presenting with uveitis were identified. Of these, 21 (2.5%) were diagnosed with neoplastic masquerade syndromes. The average age at presentation of masquerade syndrome patients was 57 years (median, 55; range, 38-78); for uveitis, 42 years (median, 43; range, 3-98) (P = 0.0003). There were 48% females in the masquerade syndromes group, compared with 59% females in the uveitis group. African American patients represented 9% of the masquerade syndrome patients and 36% of uveitis patients (P = 0.01). Mean worse eye visual acuity was 0.89 (20/160) in neoplastic masquerade syndromes, and 0.66 (20/100) in the uveitis group (P = 0.21). Of masquerade syndrome patients, 90% had posterior inflammation, compared with 63% of uveitis patients (P = 0.006). Of those with masquerade syndromes, 48% of patients had unilateral disease, compared with 27% of the uveitis patients (P = 0.04).
CONCLUSIONS: Patients with neoplastic masquerade syndromes were more likely to be older, male, or non-African American and to have posterior segment inflammation and unilateral disease. Patients with masquerade syndromes also had worse visual acuity than did uveitis patients. These differences in clinical characteristics may help to raise the suspicion for neoplastic masquerade syndromes.",15,2014-Mar-1

To describe the prevalence, demographics, clinical features, and contributors to vision loss at presentation in a large cohort of patients with ocular toxoplasmosis seen at a tertiary referral center in northern California.
METHODS: A retrospective review of the charts of 233 patients with ocular toxoplasmosis examined over 24 years.
RESULTS: Ocular toxoplasmosis was diagnosed in 233 (8.4%) of 2761 patients with uveitis. The mean age at presentation was 27.2 years. Patients with ocular toxoplasmosis were more likely to be young (p<0.01), male (p<0.001), and Latino (p<0.001) as compared with patients in the entire uveitis cohort. At presentation, 159 patients (68.2%) had active disease, which was unilateral in all but one. Among the 160 eyes with active disease, 145 (90.6%) presented with a focal retinochoroiditis, 57.2% of which had an adjacent retinochoroidal scar. Atypical presentations occurred in 11 patients (6.9%). Of eyes with active disease, the main contributors to vision loss at presentation were intraocular inflammation (74.8%) and macular involvement (24.3%), whereas in eyes with inactive lesions the main contributors to vision loss were macular scar formation (67.9%) and amblyopia (11.3%). Younger age was the single significant predictor of macular involvement.
CONCLUSIONS: Ocular toxoplasmosis is a common cause of uveitis. Our patients were more likely than general uveitis patients to be young, male, and Latino, often having emigrated from Mexico or Central or South America. The most common contributors to decreased vision in eyes with active lesions were inflammation and macular involvement, whereas in eyes with inactive lesions they were macular scar formation and amblyopia.",15,2011-1-1

Authors: Caspi, Rachel R
Publication Date: 2014-Mar-1
PMID: 24641958
In recent years considerable headway has been made on understanding the mechanisms underlying inflammatory diseases of the eye. This includes the role of the innate vs. adaptive arms of the immune systems in disease, the concept that distinct immune pathways can drive end-organ pathology, and the role as well as limitations of immune privilege in controlling the innate and adaptive effector responses that lead to eye pathology and loss of vision. These insights have largely been derived from basic studies in established and in newly developed animal models of uveitis. The increased understanding of disease mechanisms has the potential to guide development of rational therapies for human uveitis. Many novel biologics currently in use or being evaluated have been developed, or validated, in animal models of autoimmune and inflammatory disease, including experimental uveitis. Paradoxically, and fueled in part by dwindling research budgets, a campaign has been gathering momentum against use of animal models in preclinical research, as being poorly representative of responses in humans. Given the extensive genetic similarity between humans and laboratory rodents as revealed by the Human, Mouse and Rat Genome Projects, and the finding that almost all known disease-associated genes have orthologs in mice and rats, perhaps the problem is our still-insufficient understanding of mechanisms and inadequate knowledge of species differences, resulting in poor choice of models, rather than in an inherent unsuitability of animal models to represent human disease.",15,2014-Mar-1

Drug-induced uveitis is a relatively rare occurrence. For example, the patient database at the tertiary referral Uveitis Clinic at the Casey Eye Institute, Oregon Health Sciences University records an incidence of less than 0.5%. Despite this, the frequency of uveitis secondary to rifabutin therapy in AIDS patients has brought greater recognition to the potential role of medications as a cause of intraocular inflammation. A brief review of uveitis including its classification, causes, symptoms and signs is presented along with a review of systemic medications associated with uveitis. These medications include cidofovir, cobalt, diethylcarbamazepine, pamidronic acid (disodium pamidronate), interleukin-3 and interleukin-6, oral contraceptives, quinidine, rifabutin, streptokinase and sulfonamides. Other systemic medications may cause uveitis. Topical ocular medications such as beta-blockers and corticosteroids as well as other topical ocular medications have been associated with uveitis. Cidofovir, pamidronic acid, sulfonamides, rifabutin and topical metipranolol can 'probably' cause uveitis. The remainder of the medications discussed have a 'possible' cause-and-effect relationship with uveitis. Treatment begins with recognition of a drug-related event and usually subsequent avoidance of the drug. Therapy depends on the severity and likelihood of the reaction. Drug-induced uveitis is almost always reversible within weeks of discontinuation of the drug and treatment of the inflammation.",15,1997-Sep-1

51 (30 men and 21 women) of 90 consecutive patients with acute non-granulomatous anterior uveitis were HL-A 27 positive. This frequency of 55-7 per cent compares with 8-2 per cent in controls. Twenty-three patients (18 men and 5 women) had in addition evidence of systemic disease, including ankylosing spondylitis, sacroiliitis and Reiter's syndrome, sometimes associated with psoriasis. Twenty-eight of 63 patients without evidence of systemic disease were HL-A 27 positive, suggesting that the uveitis in many of these cases has a similar aetiology to those with rheumatic disease. The uveitis associated with HL-A 27 is typically unilateral, associated with mechanical ptosis, and a painful diffusely red, photophobic, and lacrimating eye, generally lasting 3 weeks or more. Protein extravasation into the aqueous is considerable, cells are usually present in the aqueous and anterior vitreous, and keratic precipitates are never mutton fat in appearance. Recurrent episodes are characteristic. The association with HL-A 27 suggests that many if not most cases of non-granulomatous anterior uveitis have a close aetiological relationship to ankylosing spondylitis and Reiter's syndrome and it is likely that infective agents, leading to an unusual immunologically mediated inflammatory response in predisposed individuals, are involved. Ten patients with granulomatous anterior uveitis were HL-A 27 negative.",15,1975-May-1

Uveitis could be a reaction to bacterial debris disseminated to the eye from extraocular sites of infection. In this study, we relate the composition of several bacterial components to their inflammatory properties in the eye. Groups of rabbits were injected intravitreously with peptidoglycan-polysaccharide (PG-PS) complexes isolated from group A streptococci, Escherichia coli lipopolysaccharide (LPS), or synthetic muramyl dipeptide (MDP). The lipid A region of LPS and the glycan backbone of PG are chemical analogues; MDP is the minimal biologically active subunit of PG. All of these molecules elicited uveitis as observed both clinically and histologically. The MDP elicited an acute inflammation characterized by a heterophil and monocyte infiltrate that subsided within 16 days. The PG-PS and LPS elicited chronic inflammation characterized by mononuclear and lymphocyte infiltration and severe necrosis of the retina.",15,1984-Jul-1

To report the results of IFNα2a therapy in patients with Behçet uveitis refractory to azathioprine-cyclosporine combination treatment.
METHODS: In a retrospective study, 39 patients treated with either azathioprine-cyclosporine combination treatment (group 1, n = 23) or IFNα2a (group 2, n = 16) with a diagnosis of ocular Behçet disease (BD), were included in the study. Group 2 consisted of patients who did not respond to conventional combination therapy, and were therefore treated with IFNα2a. Clinical response and relapse rates were recorded for each group.
RESULTS: The mean number of uveitis attacks/year per patient was 0.8 ± 1.6 in Group 1. In Group 2, a significant decrease in the mean number of uveitis attacks/year per patient was observed after initiation of IFNα2a (2.4 ± 1.8 vs 1.3 ± 2.0) (p<0.05). When the two groups were compared after administration of IFNα2a therapy, no statistical difference was found in terms of uveitis attack/year and attack-free intervals, with a partial response to both treatments.
CONCLUSIONS: IFNα2a therapy is an effective alternative for Behçet uveitis patients where conventional combination therapy fails.",15,2017-Feb-1

Childhood uveitis is a vision-threatening inflammatory eye disease commonly attributed to juvenile idiopathic arthritis (JIA). The pathogenesis is poorly understood, which makes clinical management challenging. We analyzed soluble mediators in ocular fluid (aqueous humor [AqH]) and serum from children with JIA-associated uveitis and common childhood uveitis to identify potential biomarkers and investigate the ocular microenvironment of this sight-threatening eye disease.
METHODS: AqH (n = 73) and paired serum (n = 66) samples were analyzed for 51 soluble mediators of inflammation by multiplex immunoassay. Twenty-one children with JIA-associated uveitis were compared to 15 children with chronic anterior uveitis without arthritis, 29 children with noninfectious idiopathic uveitis, and 8 children with noninflammatory conditions (controls). For visualization of the joint effect of multiple mediators, we used the radial coordinate visualization (Radviz) method. Optimal biomarker level cutoffs were also determined.
RESULTS: The levels of interleukin-29 (IL-29)/interferon-λ1 (IFNλ1) were decreased (P < 0.001) and the levels of latency-associated peptide and osteoprotegerin were increased (P = 0.002 and P = 0.001, respectively) in samples of AqH, but not serum, from patients with JIA-associated uveitis. Multivariate analysis correcting for disease activity and treatment revealed that intraocular levels of IL-29/IFNλ1 were specifically decreased in patients with JIA-associated uveitis as compared to those with idiopathic uveitis. Indeed, JIA-associated uveitis patients and idiopathic uveitis patients showed distinct profiles of intraocular soluble mediators. IL-29/IFNλ1 showed a high area under the curve value (0.954), with 23.5 pg/ml as the optimal cutoff value.
CONCLUSION: We identified IL-29/IFNλ1 as an intraocular biomarker for JIA-associated uveitis, which suggests that aberrant IFNλ signaling might be important in JIA-associated uveitis and distinct from other forms of childhood uveitis.",15,2016-Jul-1

Retinal vasculitis is a rare, but potentially blinding intraocular inflammatory condition with diverse aetiology. Although commonly idiopathic, it has a strong association with systemic inflammatory diseases known to involve other areas of the central nervous system, most notably Behcet's disease, sarcoidosis, systemic lupus erythematosis and multiple sclerosis. This article describes the clinicopathologic features of retinal vasculitis and its visually damaging sequelae, reviewing available human histopathologic studies and work with experimental models to discuss the pathogenesis and immunopathology. Evidence indicates that noninfective retinal vasculitis is an autoimmune condition that may be induced by antecedent infection with microbes cross-reacting with putative autoantigens, influenced by genetic susceptibility of both HLA associations and cytokine polymorphisms. The growing understanding of the cellular mechanisms involved in the effector immune response is already providing a rationale for more specific therapeutic approaches.",15,2003-Aug-1

PurposeTo analyze the macular structure in a large series of consecutive patients with different types of uveitis using spectral-domain optical coherence tomography (SD-OCT).Patients and methodsFive hundred eyes of 500 consecutive patients with anterior, intermediate, posterior, and panuveitis underwent standardized macular examination using SD-OCT. Central retinal thickness (CRT), macular volume (MV), and presence of cystoid macular edema (CME), diffuse macular edema (DME), serous retinal detachment (SRD), epiretinal membrane with (ERM+) and without (ERM-) retinal surface wrinkling were determined.ResultsThe anatomic location of inflammation affected significantly CRT and MV (P<0.001, respectively), with the highest values in intermediate and panuveitis. CME was seen in 25% of all uveitic eyes, DME in 11%, SRD in 8%, ERM+ in 18%, and ERM- in 13%. CME was most frequent in intermediate (40%) and panuveitis (36%); DME was most frequent in panuveitis (18%) and posterior uveitis (17%); SRD was most frequent in panuveitis (15%) and posterior uveitis (10%); ERM+ was most frequent in panuveitis (45%) and intermediate uveitis (30%); and ERM- was most frequent in intermediate (14%) and posterior uveitis (15%).ConclusionSD-OCT of the macula is recommended for all uveitis patients. CRT, MV, and the incidence of CME were highest in intermediate and panuveitis.",15,2016-Nov-1

Neovascularization is an infrequent but serious complication of uveitis. The retina and optic disk appear to be affected most often, although new blood vessels may arise from the iris, ciliary body, and choroid as well. Although neovascularization can usually be identified on careful clinical examination, some patients may require fluorescein angiography or UBM. Numerous neovascular growth and inhibitory factors have been identified experimentally. Clinically, however, uveitic neovascularization appears to be determined most directly by the severity of the inflammation and the presence of retinal nonperfusion. Virtually all patients with uveitic neovascularization deserve a trial of local or systemic corticosteroids. Laser photocoagulation can be considered in those patients who fail to respond to corticosteroid therapy, but only when retinal nonperfusion has been demonstrated on fluorescein angiography. Surgical excision of newly formed vessels is reserved for selected patients with CNV and uveitis, but should only be considered when corticosteroids and focal photocoagulation are ineffective or are otherwise contraindicated.",15,2000-1-1

To evaluate adalimumab therapy in children with uveitis.
METHODS: The electronic health records of pediatric patients diagnosed with uveitis and treated with adalimumab therapy were reviewed retrospectively. Demographic information, site and degree of intraocular inflammation, visual acuity, underlying systemic disorders, duration of therapy, side effects, and ability to obtain steroid-free remission were recorded.
RESULTS: A total of 17 patients were included, 16 patients with anterior uveitis and 1 with panuveitis; 14 patients had bilateral disease. Juvenile idiopathic arthritis had been diagnosed in 14 patients, sarcoidosis in 1 patient, and idiopathic etiology in 2 patients. Of the 17 patients, 13 (about 77%) achieved steroid-free remission, and 4 did not. Six patients flared after discontinuation of adalimumab, with evidence of inflammation noted 3-7 months later. Adalimumab therapy was of 12-64 months' duration (mean, 36 months). At the time of initiation, 14 patients were using other agents concomitantly with adalimumab; 3 patients were on adalimumab monotherapy. At 1 year's follow-up, 12 patients were using combination therapy, and 3 patients were on adalimumab monotherapy: 11 patients had no evidence of inflammation. Side effects included pain at site of injection in 3 patients, anemia in 1 patient, and depression in 1 patient.
CONCLUSIONS: In our study cohort, adalimumab was effective in inducing steroid-free remission. It was well tolerated, especially in combination with other immunomodulatory agents. The dosing and the interval can be adjusted to further improve inflammation control.",15,2016-Apr-1

AS101 is an organotellurium compound with multifaceted immunoregulatory properties that is remarkable for its lack of toxicity. We tested the therapeutic effect of AS101 in experimental autoimmune uveitis (EAU), a model for human autoimmune uveitis. Unexpectedly, treatment with AS101 elicited Treg generation in vivo in otherwise unmanipulated mice. Mice immunized for EAU with the retinal antigen IRBP and treated with AS101 developed attenuated disease, as did AS101-treated recipients of retina-specific T cells activated in vitro. In both settings, eye-infiltrating effector T cells were decreased, whereas regulatory T (Treg) cells in the spleen were increased. Mechanistic studies in vitro revealed that AS101 restricted polarization of retina-specific T cells towards Th1 or Th17 lineage by repressing activation of their respective lineage-specific transcription factors and downstream signals. Retina-specific T cells polarized in vitro towards Th1 or Th17 in the presence of AS101 had impaired ability to induce EAU in naïve recipients. Finally, AS101 promoted differentiation of retina-specific T cells to Tregs in vitro independently of TGF-β. We conclude that AS101 modulates autoimmune T cells by inhibiting acquisition and expression of effector function and by promoting Treg generation, and suggest that AS101 could be useful as a therapeutic approach for autoimmune uveitis.",15,2019-Jun-1

This study assessed relationships between best-corrected visual acuity (BCVA), central subfield thickness (CST), and ellipsoid zone (EZ) integrity in macular edema (ME) patients.
DESIGN: Post hoc analysis of 6 clinical trials, which included verified diagnoses, protocol refractions, and reading center assessment of OCT images.
PARTICIPANTS: Participants (n = 1063) were diagnosed with ME from retinal vein occlusion (RVO), diabetic retinopathy (DR; diabetic macular edema, DME), or noninfectious uveitis (NIU).
METHODS: For CST, 2 clinical trials for each disorder were analyzed. For EZ, 3 studies across 2 disorders were analyzed.
MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Primary outcomes were correlations between BCVA and CST, and between BCVA and 4 central subfield EZ grades.
RESULTS: For baseline BCVA and CST, Pearson correlation coefficients were: ME from RVO, -0.56 (774 eyes; 95% confidence interval [CI], -0.61 to -0.51; P < 0.001); DME, -0.50 (91 eyes; 95% CI, -0.64 to -0.33; P < 0.001); and ME from NIU, -0.38 (198 eyes; 95% CI, -0.49 to -0.26; P < 0.001). Regarding change from baseline to 24 weeks for both BCVA and CST, Pearson correlation coefficients were: ME from RVO, -0.35 (95% CI, -0.43 to -0.27; P < 0.001); DME, -0.30 (95% CI, -0.48 to -0.09; P = 0.006); and ME from NIU, -0.42 (95% CI, -0.53 to -0.29; P < 0.001). Acute and chronic ME showed similar baseline and 24-week change linear correlations. With lower baseline CST, a trend of decreased baseline and 24-week change correlations was found. For central subfield EZ at baseline, mean BCVA progressively worsened with each of 4 EZ grades in 185 eyes with gradable EZ (DME, 41 eyes; NIU, 144 eyes; P ≤ 0.050 for all pairwise comparisons except between normal and questionably abnormal EZ grades). Eyes with normal baseline central subfield EZ showed greater 24-week change in BCVA than those with abnormal baseline EZ (15.00 letters vs. 8.16 letters; P = 0.0005, with baseline BCVA, CST, and age as covariates).
CONCLUSIONS: Despite these correlations, CST and EZ integrity, as graded herein, account for the minority of BCVA variation in patients with ME resulting from RVO, DR, and NIU.",15,2021-Jul-1

To evaluate the role of high-resolution computerized tomography (HRCT) of the chest as a diagnostic tool in granulomatous uveitis.
DESIGN: Observational case series.
METHODS: Fifty-eight consecutive patients were evaluated with chest HRCT based on clinical diagnosis of granulomatous uveitis, which was further classified using SUN classification as anterior, intermediate, posterior, and panuveitis. Clinical profile, laboratory findings, chest radiographs, and chest HRCT scans were analyzed.
RESULTS: Of 58 patients, 35 were males and 23 females with mean age of 43.5 years. Forty-seven patients had bilateral and 11 had unilateral involvement. Eighty-one percent of patients referred for chest HRCT demonstrated signs suggestive of tuberculosis, 8.6% patients showed signs suggestive of sarcoidosis, and 10.3% patients showed normal chest HRCT.
CONCLUSION: Chest HRCT was found to be a useful tool in the diagnosis of granulomatous uveitis, especially tuberculosis associated uveitis, and can aid in therapeutic decisions.",15,2011-Feb-1

Tubulointerstitial nephritis and uveitis (TINU) syndrome is a rare disease, defined by the association of idiopathic acute TINU. The aim of our work was to determine the characteristics of adult TINU syndrome in France, and to assess factors (including treatment) influencing medium-term prognosis.We conducted a nationwide study including 20 French hospitals. Clinical, laboratory, and renal histopathologic data of 41 biopsy-proven TINU syndromes were retrospectively collected. The patients were diagnosed between January 1, 1999 and December 1, 2015.Twenty-five females and 16 males were included (F/M ratio: 1.6:1). The median age at disease onset was 46.8 years (range 16.8-77.4) with a median serum creatinine level at 207 μmol/L (range 100-1687) and a median estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) at 27 mL/min per 1.73 m (range 2-73). Twenty-nine patients (71%) had a bilateral anterior uveitis and 24 (59%) had deterioration in general health at presentation. Moderate proteinuria was found in 32 patients (78%) (median proteinuria 0.52 g/24 h; range 0.10-2.10), aseptic leukocyturia in 25/36 patients (70%). The evaluation of renal biopsies revealed 41 patients (100%) with an acute tubulointerstitial nephritis, 19/39 patients (49%) with light to moderate fibrosis and 5 patients (12%) with an acute tubular necrosis. Thirty-six patients (88%) were treated with oral corticosteroids. After 1 year of follow-up, the median eGFR was 76 mL/min per 1.73 m (range 17-119) and 32% of the patients suffered from moderate to severe chronic kidney disease. Serum creatinine (P < 0.001, r = -0.54), serum bicarbonate and phosphate levels (respectively, P = 0.01, r = 0.53; and P = 0.04, r = 0.46), and age (P = 0.03, r = -0.37) at the 1st symptoms were associated with eGFR after 1 year. During the 1st year 40% of patients had uveitis relapses. The use of oral corticosteroids was not associated with a better kidney function but was associated with fewer uveitis relapses (P = 0.44 and 0.02, respectively).In our study, 32% of patients were suffering from moderate to severe chronic kidney disease after 1 year of follow-up, and 40% had uveitis relapses during this follow-up. This work also suggests that oral corticosteroids are effective for the treatment of TINU syndrome's uveitis.",15,2016-Jun-1

The purpose of this study was to compare the histologic features and cytokine profiles of experimental autoimmune uveitis (EAU) and a primed mycobacterial uveitis (PMU) model in rats.
METHODS: In Lewis rats, EAU was induced by immunization with interphotoreceptor binding protein peptide, and PMU was induced by immunization with a killed mycobacterial extract followed by intravitreal injection of the same extract. Clinical course, histology, and the cytokine profiles of the aqueous and vitreous were compared using multiplex bead fluorescence immunoassays.
RESULTS: Primed mycobacterial uveitis generates inflammation 2 days after intravitreal injection and resolves spontaneously 14 days later. CD68+ lymphocytes are the predominant infiltrating cells and are found in the anterior chamber, surrounding the ciliary body and in the vitreous. In contrast to EAU, no choroidal infiltration or retinal destruction is noted. At the day of peak inflammation, C-X-C motif ligand 10 (CXCL10), IL-1β, IL-18, and leptin were induced in the aqueous of both models. Interleukin-6 was induced 2-fold in the aqueous of PMU but not EAU. Cytokines elevated in the aqueous of EAU exclusively include regulated on activation, normal T cell expressed and secreted (RANTES), lipopolysaccharide-induced CXC chemokine (LIX), growth-related oncogene/keratinocyte chemokine (GRO/KC), VEGF, monocyte chemoattractant protein-1 (MCP-1), macrophage inflammatory protein-1α (MIP-1α), and IL-17A. In the vitreous, CXCL10, GRO/KC, RANTES, and MIP-1α were elevated in both models. Interleukin-17A and IL-18 were elevated exclusively in EAU.
CONCLUSIONS: Primed mycobacterial uveitis generates an acute anterior and intermediate uveitis without retinal involvement. Primed mycobacterial uveitis has a distinct proinflammatory cytokine profile compared with EAU, suggesting PMU is a good complementary model for study of immune-mediated uveitis. CXCL10, a proinflammatory cytokine, was increased in the aqueous and vitreous of both models and may be a viable therapeutic target.",15,2015-Dec-1

Autoimmune uveitis is an organ-specific disorder characterized by irreversible lesions to the eye that predominantly affect people in their most productive years and is among the leading causes of visual deficit and blindness. Currently available therapies are effective in the treatment of a wide spectrum of uveitis, but are often associated with severe side effects. Here, we review ongoing research with promising immunomodulatory therapeutic strategies, describing their specific features, interactions and the responses triggered by the targeted immune molecules that aim to minimize clinical complications and the likelihood of disease relapse. We first review the main features of the disease, diagnostic tools, and traditional forms of therapy, as well as the animal models predominantly used to understand the pathogenesis and test the novel intervention approaches aiming to control the acute immune and inflammatory responses and to dampen chronic responses. Both exploratory research and clinical trials have targeted either the blockade of effector pathways or of their companion co-stimulatory molecules. Examples of targets are T cell receptors (CD3), their co-stimulatory receptors (CD28, CTLA-4) and corresponding ligands (B7-1 and B7-2, also known as CD80 and CD86), and cytokines like IL-2 and their receptors. Here, we summarize the available evidence on effectiveness of these treatments in human and experimental uveitis and highlight a novel CD28 antagonist monovalent Fab' antibody, FR104, which has shown preclinical efficacy suppressing effector T cells while enhancing regulatory T cell function and immune tolerance in a humanized graft-versus-host disease (GVHD) mice model and is currently being tested in a mouse autoimmune uveitis model with encouraging results.",15,2014-Sep-1

Equine recurrent uveitis (ERU) has various etiologies, with Leptospira infection and genetic predisposition being the leading risk factors. Regardless of etiology, expression of ocular proteins associated with maintenance of the blood-ocular barrier is impaired in ERU. The recurring-remitting cycle of ERU repeatedly disrupts the blood-ocular barrier, allowing the previously immune-privileged ocular environment to become the site of a progressive local autoimmune pathology that ultimately results in tissue destruction and vision loss. The immune-mediated process involves humoral and cellular mechanisms. Intraocular antibodies either produced in the eye or that leak through the blood-ocular barrier, are often present at higher levels than in serum and react with antigens in ocular tissue of horses with ERU. Ocular infiltration of auto-aggressive lymphocytes occurs with each uveitis episode and is the most crucial contributor to inflammation and eye damage. Recurring uveitis episodes may be initiated when epitopes of an ocular antigen become visible to the immune system (intramolecular spreading) or another autoantigen (intermolecular spreading), resulting in a new inflammatory reaction.",15,2016-Feb-1

Sarcoidosis is a systemic disease of unknown aetiology characterized by the presence of non-caseating epithelioid cell granulomas in multiple organs, mainly the lungs and the lymphatic system. It is also one of the leading cause of inflammatory eye diseases. For the past 70 years, sarcoidal granulomas on tattoos and permanent make-up have been documented. They can be the first and sometimes unique cutaneous manifestation of systemic sarcoidosis. A few cases of sarcoidosis with uveitis and granulomatous reactions within tattoos have been described. However, since the end 60s, a singular entity has been reported associating isolated uveitis with granulomatous cutaneous reaction restricted to tattoos in the notable absence of systemic sarcoidosis. It remains unclear whether this entity must be distinguished from sarcoidosis. This review summarizes the currently available data on this topic and compares cases of sarcoidosis with granulomatous tattoo reaction and uveitis to the cases without notable sarcoidosis. We propose the acronym TAGU (TAttoo Granulomas with Uveitis) as an exclusion diagnosis that emcompasses the patients for whom we fail to find any sarcoidosis or other causes after extensive investigation.",15,2018-Nov-1

As a featured ocular inflammatory disease, autoimmune uveitis is the major cause of blindness in the clinic. Although current immunosuppressive regimens can alleviate the progression of autoimmune uveitis, they have serious side effects. Therefore, an alternative therapeutic strategy is urgently required. The present study investigated the therapeutic efficacy of human amniotic epithelial cells (hAECs) on autoimmune uveitis in a rat model. Herein, experimental autoimmune uveitis (EAU) was induced in rats via a subcutaneous injection of interphotoreceptor retinoid-binding protein. EAU rats were treated with hAECs or the vehicle solution via a subretinal injection on day 0 and day 6 after immunization, and rats were sacrificed on day 12 and day 18 for further analysis. The pathological development of EAU was evaluated by slit lamp microscopy. Immune cell infiltration and retinal structure damage were examined by histological examination of hematoxylin and eosin (H&E) and immunofluorescence staining. T-cell subsets were detected by flow cytometry, and the levels of inflammatory cytokines were quantified by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA). hAEC treatment ameliorated the pathological progression of EAU and preserved the retinal structure organization and thickness, especially in the preventive group that received a subretinal injection on day 0. Moreover, hAECs inhibited the retinal infiltration of macrophages and T-cells. Mechanistically, hAECs modulated the balance of T-cell subsets by downregulating T helper (Th)17 cells and upregulating T regulatory (Treg) cells, as confirmed by decreased interleukin (IL)-17 and increased IL-10 levels in the spleens and lymph nodes of EAU rats. Furthermore, hAECs improved the local cytokine environment in EAU rats by suppressing the monocyte chemoattractant protein (MCP)-1, IL-17 and interferon (IFN)-γ levels and enhancing the IL-10 in the aqueous humor. Therefore, subretinal transplantation of hAECs in EAU rats ameliorated ocular inflammation, preserved the retinal structure and coordinated the immune balance. The current study provides a novel therapeutic strategy for autoimmune uveitis and related ocular inflammatory diseases in the clinic.",15,2018-Oct-1

To investigate dexamethasone intravitreal implant (DEX Implant 0.7 mg, Ozurdex; Allergan, Inc, Irvine, CA) as a treatment for persistent cystoid macular edema (CME) secondary to uveitis.
METHODS: Treatment and outcomes data were collected retrospectively for 18 eyes from 13 consecutive patients treated with the DEX Implant for persistent, noninfectious uveitic CME. Outcome measures included the cumulative incidence of resolution of CME, visual acuity, central retinal thickness (measured by spectral domain optical coherence tomography), and vitreous haze score.
RESULTS: After a single DEX Implant, there was no detectable CME in 89% and 72% of eyes at 1 month and 3 months, respectively. The median time to recurrence of CME (±standard error) was 201 ± 62 days. The percentage of eyes with no recurrence of CME was 35% at 6 months and 30% at 12 months. At 3 months, there was a significant improvement from baseline in mean visual acuity (+2.1 lines, P < 0.01). Eyes with an epiretinal membrane at baseline had shorter time to recurrence of CME and smaller improvements in visual acuity and central retinal thickness than eyes without an epiretinal membrane. At least 1 episode of intraocular pressure >25 mmHg occurred within the first 3 months in 11% (2 of 18) of eyes; all effectively managed with topical hypotensive medications.
CONCLUSION: A single DEX Implant produced sustained improvements in both visual acuity and retinal thickness in the majority of eyes with persistent uveitic CME. Uveitic CME did gradually recur in most eyes; however, close posttreatment monitoring is recommended.",15,2015-Aug-1

Uveitis and scleritis are the most serious ocular side effects of bisphosphonate therapy. The purpose of this study was to determine the 6-month rates of uveitis/scleritis following dispensing of bisphosphonates in a large veteran cohort.
METHODS: Two national databases (clinical and pharmacy) for fiscal year (FY) 2006 were linked to identify new diagnoses of uveitis/scleritis following the initial dispensing of bisphosphonate drugs. New diagnoses in FY 2006 were identified using International Classification of Diseases, Version 9, Clinical Modification (ICD-9-CM), in a cohort of veterans without a previous diagnosis of uveitis or scleritis using a look-back period to FY 2005. The new diagnoses were temporally aligned with initial dispensing of bisphosphonates and the rates of new cases were calculated for 1-month and 6-month time intervals.
RESULTS: There were 7.9 new cases of uveitis/scleritis per 10,000 individuals with a newly dispensed bisphosphonate that occurred within 180 days. The relative risk of uveitis/scleritis for 6 months was 1.23 (95% confidence interval: 0.85-1.79) compared to veterans not exposed to the medications. The rates of uveitis/scleritis did not differ significantly based on route of administration (oral or parenteral) or after age adjustment. Just over a third of the diagnoses were scleritis. Nearly 43% of patients with uveitis/scleritis after bisphosphonate use had a systemic diagnosis commonly associated with inflammation of the uveal tract or sclera.
CONCLUSIONS: The 30-day and 6-month rates of uveitis/scleritis following the dispensing of a bisphosphonate drug are low and do not differ significantly from rates recorded for veterans not dispensed these drugs.",15,2008-Jun-1

During a 4-year period, the authors examined 19 patients with Crohn's disease and associated ocular inflammation. Seven patients had uveitis, eight had episcleritis, and four had anterior scleritis. Large peripheral corneal infiltrates developed in two patients with scleritis. Increased bowel activity was closely related to the presence of acute episcleritis but not to uveitis or scleritis. To determine risk factors for the development of ocular inflammation, this group of 19 patients was compared with a group of 93 patients with Crohn's disease in whom ocular inflammation was not present. There were no demographic differences between the groups. Patients with colitis or ileocolitis were more likely to suffer from ocular inflammation (23.9%, 17 of 71), than patients with small bowel involvement alone (2.8%, 1 of 36) (P = 0.013). Those with arthritis or arthralgia had a higher incidence of ocular inflammation (29.4%, 15 of 51), than patients without joint involvement (6.6%, 4 of 61) (P = 0.003). These results suggest that the risk of developing ocular inflammation in Crohn's disease may be related to the site of bowel involvement and to the presence of arthritis.",15,1991-Apr-1

The dynamic changes of the lymphocyte subsets in the inflamed ocular tissue in Lewis rats with experimental autoimmune uveitis (EAU) were studied by immunohistopathological evaluation at varying intervals after initiation of the disease. Monoclonal antibodies to specific markers of the rat T-helper/inducer lymphocyte (W3/25) and T-suppressor/cytotoxic lymphocyte (OX-8) were used in the avidin-biotin-peroxidase complex (ABC) method. During the early stages of the disease following the acute inflammatory reaction, the T-helper/inducer lymphocytes are found in larger numbers within the infiltrates, the relative number of the T-suppressor/cytotoxic cells is very low during the initial phases, with a ratio as low as 5 to 1. During the later stages, there is a continuous increase in the relative number of suppressor/cytotoxic cells that reaches the ratio of 1 to 1, or even 1 to 2. It is postulated that the observed changes in the ratios between T-helper/inducer and T-suppressor/cytotoxic cells during the different stages of EAU may reflect the kinetics and regulation of the inflammatory response in autoimmune diseases.",15,1985-Apr-1

Rapamycin, a potent immune modulator, is used to treat transplant rejection and some autoimmune diseases. Uveitis is a potentially severe inflammatory eye disease, and 2 clinical trials of treating uveitis with rapamycin are under way. Unexpectedly, recent research has demonstrated that low dose rapamycin enhances the memory T cell population and function. However, it is unclear how low dose rapamycin influences the immune response in the setting of uveitis.
DESIGN AND METHODS: B10.RIII mice were immunized to induce experimental autoimmune uveitis (EAU). Ocular inflammation of control and rapamycin-treated mice was compared based on histological change. ELISPOT and T cell proliferation assays were performed to assess splenocyte response to ocular antigen. In addition, we examined the effect of rapamycin on activation-induced cell death (AICD) using the MitoCapture assay and Annexin V staining.
RESULTS: Administration of low dose rapamycin exacerbated EAU, whereas treating mice with high dose rapamycin attenuated ocular inflammation. The progression of EAU by low dose rapamycin coincided with the increased frequency of antigen-reactive lymphocytes. Lastly, fewer rapamycin-treated T cells underwent AICD, which might contribute to exaggerated ocular inflammation and the uveitogenic immune response.
CONCLUSION: These data reveal a paradoxical role for rapamycin in uveitis in a dose-dependent manner.

To evaluate the response to treatment in patients with tubulointerstitial nephritis and uveitis (TINU) syndrome over a long-term follow-up period.
METHODS: Nine patients with TINU syndrome were retrospectively reviewed. The mean follow-up was 54.8 months (range: 24-133 months).
RESULTS: The mean number of recurrences per year declined from 1.7 in the 1st year to 0.66 in the 2nd year of treatment. The ocular inflammation responded to local corticosteroids in two patients, systemic corticosteroids in two patients, immunosuppressive therapy in four patients, and anti-TNF-α blocking agent in one patient. The therapy could be discontinued in six (67%) patients after a mean treatment period of 29.5 months. In five patients, remission with the recurrence-free period of 12.8 months was achieved.
CONCLUSIONS: TINU syndrome was characterized by limited responsiveness to corticosteroid therapy and less by severe complications. A long-term course of immunosuppressants or biologics was necessary to control the uveitis and led to induction of remission.",15,2018-1-1

Topical administration of corticosteroids is the cornerstone treatment of anterior uveitis, but poor corneal penetration and retention cause hindrance in their therapeutic utility. The conventional eye drops are less valuable in conditions where inflammation reaches deeper regions of the eye. Therefore, there is a clear need for an effective drug delivery system, which can increase corticosteroid penetration after topical application. To address this, cationic nanostructured lipid carriers of the drug triamcinolone acetonide (cTA-NLC) were prepared. The cTA-NLC were prepared by a hot microemulsion method and evaluated for drug release, permeation, cell uptake, cytotoxicity, anti-inflammatory activity and ocular irritancy. The cTA-NLC are nanometric in size (< 200 nm), with a zeta potential of about +35 mv and % drug EE of 88 %. The nanocarriers exhibited slow and sustained release of around 84 % in 24 h and transcorneal drug permeation of 51 % in 8 h. The nanocarriers exhibited no cytotoxicity (% cell viability of>90 %). The cell uptake study showed that nanocarriers could retain inside the cells for 24 h. The developed formulation could significantly reduce the TNF-α level in LPS induced inflamed cells. The studies indicated that cTA-NLC could be a promising option for the topical treatment of uveitis.",15,2020-Jun-1

Uveitis is one of the most common ocular diseases and one of the most common causes of blindness in dogs. The purpose of this retrospective study was to correlate the signalment, history, clinical signs and ophthalmic findings of dogs with uveitis with the underlying etiology. We conducted a retrospective study of 102 dogs presented to the NCSU-VTH from 1989 to 2000 with clinical signs of uveitis. Medical records of dogs presented for uveitis were reviewed. Dogs were included in the study only if a complete diagnostic work-up database was collected, if sufficient follow-up was documented, and if the uveitis was not secondary to trauma or a hypermature cataract. The mean age +/- SD of all dogs in this study was 6.2 +/- 3.6 years. There were 33 intact and 16 castrated males, and 14 intact and 27 neutered females. Fourteen breeds were represented, with the Golden Retriever (n = 14) most common. Fifty-nine dogs (58%) were diagnosed with idiopathic/immune-mediated uveitis, neoplasia was diagnosed in 25 dogs (24.5%) and 18 dogs (17.6%) were diagnosed with infectious causes of uveitis. Aqueous flare was the most common clinical sign, occurring in 88 dogs (86%). The most common infectious organisms associated with uveitis in the dogs of this study were Ehrlichia canis (n = 7). Lymphosarcoma (n = 17) was the most common neoplasm. In approximately 60% of dogs presenting for uveitis an underlying cause was not found, and a diagnosis of immune-mediated or idiopathic uveitis was made. However, approximately 25% of dogs had ocular and/or systemic neoplasia (with 17% of cases having lymphosarcoma) and 18% with an underlying infectious cause for uveitis. Because of the high percentage of systemic disease associated with uveitis in dogs, extensive diagnostic testing is recommended before instituting symptomatic anti-inflammatory therapy.",15,2002-Jun-1

To investigate the therapeutic value of azathioprine as monotherapy or combined with other immunosuppressive drugs for uveitis in patients with juvenile idiopathic arthritis (JIA).
METHODS: A retrospective multicentre study including 41 children with JIA (28 (68.2%) female) with unilateral or bilateral (n=28) chronic anterior uveitis. Azathioprine was used to treat uveitis that was active in patients receiving topical or systemic corticosteroids, methotrexate or other immunosuppressive drugs. The primary end point was assessment of uveitis inactivity. Secondary end points comprised dose sparing of topical steroids and systemic corticosteroids, and immunosuppression.
RESULTS: At 1 year, uveitis inactivity was achieved in 13/17 (76.5%) patients by using azathioprine as systemic monotherapy and in 5/9 (56.6%) as combination therapy. During the entire azathioprine treatment period (mean 26 months), inactivity was obtained in 16/26 patients (61.5%) with monotherapy and in 10/15 (66.7%) when combined with other immunosuppressives (p=1.0). With azathioprine, dosages of systemic immunosuppression and steroids could be reduced by ≥ 50% (n=12) or topical steroids reduced to ≤ 2 drops/eye/day in six patients. In three patients (7.3%), azathioprine was discontinued because of nausea and stomach pain. Conclusions Azathioprine may be reconsidered in the stepladder approach for the treatment of JIA-associated uveitis. The addition of azathioprine may also be beneficial for patients not responding properly to methotrexate.",15,2011-Feb-1

To assess the efficacy of a dexamethasone (DEX) intravitreal implant in a rabbit model of anterior and intermediate uveitis.
METHODS: Experimental anterior and intermediate uveitis was induced by a unilateral intracameral injection of Mycobacterium tuberculosis H37Ra antigen in preimmunized rabbits. Four days after uveitis induction, rabbits received DEX implant or underwent a sham procedure (no implant). Clinical and histopathologic signs of uveitis were assessed for 13 days, and levels of inflammatory markers in the iris/ciliary body were measured after 21 days.
RESULTS: All signs of anterior and intermediate uveitis were reduced by the DEX implant compared with sham procedure. At day 13, mean anterior chamber cell scores ± SD for the DEX implant versus the sham procedure were, respectively, 1.9 ± 1.3 versus 4.0 ± 0.0 (P = 0.04), and mean total histologic inflammatory scores were 3.9 ± 2.5 versus 15.4 ± 6.0 (P = 0.026). Similarly, at day 13, mean vitreous haze severity scores (SD) for the DEX implant versus the sham procedure were, respectively, 0.1 ± 0.2 versus 2.7 ± 1.5 (P = 0.026), and mean vitreous inflammatory cell infiltration scores were 0.0 ± 0.0 versus 1.5 ± 1.3. Treatment with the DEX intravitreal implant also significantly reduced the proinflammatory immune response, as measured by cytokine levels in iris/ciliary body.
CONCLUSIONS: A single administration of DEX implant significantly reduced inflammation in an animal model of anterior and intermediate uveitis.",15,2011-May-02

Intraocular cytokines are promising diagnostic biomarkers of vitreoretinal lymphoma. Here, we evaluate the utility of IL-10, IL-6 and IL-10/IL-6 for discriminating lymphoma from uveitis and report the effects of intraocular methotrexate and rituximab on aqueous cytokine levels in eyes with lymphoma. This is a retrospective case series including 10 patients with lymphoma and 7 patients with uveitis. Non-parametric Mann-Whitney analysis was performed to determine statistical significance of difference in interleukin levels between lymphoma and uveitis. Compared to eyes with uveitis, eyes with lymphoma had higher levels of IL-10 (U = 7.0; two-tailed p = 0.004) and IL-10/IL-6 (U = 6.0; two-tailed p = 0.003), whereas IL-6 levels were more elevated, although insignificant, in those patients with uveitis than in lymphoma (U = 15.0; two-tailed p = ns). Using a receiver operating characteristic analysis to identify threshold values diagnostic for lymphoma, optimal sensitivity and specificity improved to 80.0% and 100%, respectively, for IL-10>7.025 pg/ml and 90.0% and 100.0%, respectively, for IL-10/IL-6>0.02718. In patients in whom serial interleukin levels were available, regular intravitreal treatment with methotrexate and rituximab was associated with reduction in IL-10 levels over time. In conclusion, optimal IL-10 and IL-10/IL-6 threshold values are associated with a diagnostic sensitivity ≥80% and specificity of 100%. Therefore, these cytokines may serve as a useful adjunct in the diagnosis of lymphoma. While negative IL-10 and IL-10/IL-6 values do not exclude a diagnosis of lymphoma, elevated levels do appear to be consistent with lymphoma clinically. Moreover, elevated levels of IL-10 in the setting of a clinically quiet eye may point to impending disease recurrence. Lastly, once lymphoma is diagnosed, IL-10 levels can be monitored over time to assess disease activity and therapeutic response.",14,2013-1-1

Equine recurrent uveitis (ERU) is a spontaneous disease that is the most common cause of blindness in horses, affecting up to 15% of the horse population. Th17 cells are a major cell population driving the pathogenesis in several mouse models of autoimmune inflammation, including experimental autoimmune uveitis. The purpose of this study is to investigate the role a Th17 cell-mediated response plays in the pathogenesis of ERU.
PROCEDURE: Banked, Davidson's-fixed equine globes histopathologically diagnosed with ERU (n = 7) were compared immunohistochemically with healthy control globes (n = 7). Immunohistochemical staining was performed using a pan-Leptospira antibody and antibodies against IL-6, IL-17, and IL-23. Additionally, immunostaining was performed for T-cell (CD3) and B-cell (CD79α) markers. Specificity of immunoreactivity was confirmed by western blot analysis.
RESULTS: Immunohistochemical staining was positive for IL-6, IL-17, and IL-23 within the cytoplasm of nonpigmented ciliary epithelial cells and mononuclear inflammatory cells infiltrating the iris, and ciliary body of ERU horses (n = 7) but negative in controls (n = 7). ERU-affected eyes were CD3 positive (n = 7) and CD79α negative (n = 7). Staining for Leptospira was negative in all ERU and control globes.
CONCLUSIONS: Strong immunoreactivity for IL-6, IL-17, and IL-23, in conjunction with the fact that T lymphocytes are the predominating inflammatory cells present in ERU, suggests that IL-17-secreting helper T-cells play a role in the pathogenesis of ERU. These findings suggest that horses with ERU may serve as a naturally occurring animal model for autoimmune uveitis.",14,2012-May-1

To evaluate the efficacy of interferon alfa-2a (IFN alfa) in severe uveitis associated with Behçet's disease, that is refractory to steroids and conventional immunosuppressive agents.
PATIENTS AND METHODS: Patients with Behçet's disease (according to the International Study Group criteria), who relapsed despite steroids and immunosuppressive agents, were included in this retrospective study. Ophthalmological examination, laser flare photometry, and fluorescein angiography associated with laboratory tests were performed at regular intervals. IFN alfa (3 millions units thrice a week) was injected subcutaneously.
RESULTS: Eight patients (sex ratio: 1) were included between May 1995 and January 1999. The mean age was 29.1 years (14-54 years) and the disease was present between 11 and 167 months before the administration of IFN alfa. IFN alfa was efficient in all cases with a mean follow-up of 22 months (10-55 months). Steroids were tapered from a mean dosage of 47 mg/d to a mean dosage of 8.5 mg/d. Ocular inflammation was controlled and visual acuity improved in all cases. Treatment was generally well tolerated despite a constant but transient flu-like syndrome. IFN alfa was tapered in three patients and stopped in one case without any relapse after five months.
CONCLUSIONS: Within the limitations of this retrospective study, low-dose IFN alfa seems to be well tolerated, promising in the management of refractory forms of uveitis due to Behçet's disease, and effective in allowing a reduction of steroid dosage. A prospective controlled study is necessary to confirm these preliminary results.",14,2000-Dec-1

PMID: 16282147
Fuchs' heterochromic cyclitis (FHC) is a chronic anterior segment inflammatory syndrome that accounts for 2 to 3% of all uveitis cases. The etiology is unknown, but Herpes simplex, ocular toxoplasmosis and rubella infection have been implicated in the pathogenesis of the disease. It occurs more commonly in the third and fourth decades of life with an equal gender distribution. Patients are usually asymptomatic but may present with floaters and blurry vision. There is a mild but persistent anterior chamber reaction with diffuse and characteristic white stellate keratic precipitates. Iris and trabecular meshwork show abnormal vessels that may sometimes lead to a hyphema. Synechia formation is uncommon. Heterochromia is considered an important feature and accounts for the name, but it is variable depending on the intensity of the anterior stromal atrophy, initial iris color and amount of pigment in the iris pigmented epithelium. Progression of the disease is associated with cataract formation and glaucoma. Anti-inflammatory treatment is not indicated for the low-grade anterior chamber reaction seen in Fuchs' patients. Occasionally, a short course of corticosteroids is indicated if a symptomatic exacerbation occurs. The long-term prognosis is good, and patients usually maintain a visual acuity of 20/40 or better.",14,2005-1-1

Equine recurrent uveitis (ERU) is a common disease in horses in the USA. There have been many advances in the treatment of ERU; however, frequent misdiagnosis of ERU occurs in cases of primary corneal or uveal disease. It is critical to remember that primary uveitis (i.e. one bout of inflammation) is a different disease to ERU, which is an immune mediated recurrent uveitis. Standard symptomatic anti-inflammatory therapy is effective to control most cases of ERU; however, some horses require advanced therapy, such as placement of drug delivery devices or removal of the vitreous, when they fail to respond to the standard therapy.",14,2010-Mar-1

To evaluate, in three Spanish tertiary referral centres, the short-term safety and efficacy of golimumab (GLM) for treatment of immune-mediated uveitis resistant to previous immunosuppressive therapy.
METHODS: Nonrandomized retrospective interventional case series. Thirteen patients with different types of uveitis that were resistant to treatment with at least 2 previous immunosuppressors were included in this study. All included patients were treated with GLM (50 mg every four weeks) during at least 6 months. Clinical evaluation and treatment-related side effects were assessed at least four times in all included patients.
RESULTS: Eight men and 5 women (22 affected eyes) with a median age of 30 years (range 20-38) and active immune-mediated uveitides were studied. GLM was used in combination with conventional immunosuppressors in 7 patients (53.8%). GLM therapy achieved complete control of inflammation in 12/13 patients (92.3%) after six months of treatment. There was a statistically significant improvement in mean BCVA (0.60 versus 0.68, P = 0.009) and mean 1 mm central retinal thickness (317 versus 261.2 μ, P = 0.05) at the six-month endpoint when compared to basal values. No major systemic adverse effects associated with GLM therapy were observed.

To evaluate wide-field fundus autofluorescence (FAF) in patients with uveitis with retinal or chorioretinal involvement.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: We included 78 study eyes in this prospective study. Best-corrected visual acuity, a full clinical examination, wide-field green-light FAF and composite color, green and red laser separation fundus imaging with Optomap SLO were performed. In a systematic analysis, the number, extension and margins of central and peripheral retinal or chorioretinal alterations, scars and infiltrates in infectious and non-infectious uveitic study eyes were evaluated. Wide-field FAF and color fundus imaging results were compared regarding their diagnostic properties.
RESULTS: Nine out of 78 study eyes were diagnosed with infectious, 69 cases with non-infectious uveitis. Six infectious uveitic study eyes had changes of the peripheral fundus compared with 48 of 69 non-infectious uveitic eyes. In 33 (infectious versus non-infectious: 4 versus 29) cases, wide-field FAF images revealed more retinal or chorioretinal alterations or pathologies with a farther extended demarcation than wide-field composite color fundus imaging. Eleven out of 69 non-infectious study eyes were diagnosed with vasculitis which could be more precisely evaluated with wide-field FAF than wide-field composite color, green or red light filtered fundus imaging.
CONCLUSIONS: Non-invasive wide-field FAF detects more retinal or chorioretinal involvement in patients with posterior uveitis than seen in color imaging and thus is useful in diagnosis and follow-up of uveitic patients.",14,2014-Feb-1

To determine the etiologies of uveitis and the causes of visual loss in uveitis patients at a referral center in Baghdad, Iraq.
PATIENTS AND METHODS: A 4-year prospective study was performed at the uveitis clinic at Ibn Al-Haetham teaching eye hospital in Baghdad, Iraq. Referral cases of active uveitis were included. A complete ophthalmic examination was performed in all cases. If clinical picture did not indicate a specific etiology, patients were sent for a routine set of tests while ancillary tests were conducted when indicated.
RESULTS: Out of 318 patients included in this study, 236 patients (74.2%) had bilateral uveitis, and 212 patients (66.7%) had non-granulomatous uveitis. Posterior uveitis was recorded in 123 cases (38.7%) followed by panuveitis in 97 cases (30.5%), anterior uveitis in 78 cases (24.5%), and intermediate uveitis in 20 cases (6.3%). A diagnosis was established in 210 cases (66%) while etiology could not be determined in the remaining 108 cases (34%). Most common infectious causes were toxoplasmosis (13.8%) and presumed ocular tuberculosis (11.4%) while most common non-infectious causes were Vogt-Koyanagi-Harada disease (12.3%), Behηet's disease (8.2%), and pars planitis (5.7%). Out of 49 eyes with irreversible blindness, macular degenerations, or scars (46.9%) and optic nerve atrophy (34.7%) were the most important causes.
CONCLUSION: At this referral center, toxoplasmosis and presumed ocular tuberculosis were the most common infectious causes of uveitis while Vogt-Koyanagi-Harada disease, Behηet's disease, and pars planitis were, in that order, the most common non-infectious causes. Macular degenerations or scars and optic nerve atrophy were the most important causes of irreversible blindness.",14,2014-1-1

Of 38 cases of uveitis examined from 1970 to 1980 in which a tuberculous cause was considered, we classified 18 as presumed tuberculous on the basis of a positive response to isoniazid. We compared these patients to a control group who had a positive skin test but a negative response to the isoniazid therapeutic test. We found a family history of tuberculosis in seven of the 18 (P less than .05) and a more common (18 of 36 eyes) incidence of iridocyclitis (P less than .05) than of other types of uveitis. A uveitis patient who has a positive tuberculin skin test of any size or strength should undergo the isoniazid therapeutic test to ensure that a possible diagnosis of tuberculous uveitis is not missed. Tuberculosis should be suspected in both granulomatous and non granulomatous uveal lesions, especially in cases of chronic iridocyclitis.",14,1982-Oct-1

Behçet's disease is a multisystemic, relapsing, inflammatory disorder of unknown origin. Among Turkish cohorts, 5-15% of patients show involvement of the central nervous system (CNS) at some time during their disease. There are mainly two types of clinical presentation: parenchymal CNS inflammation manifesting mainly as meningoencephalitis of the brainstem, or dural sinus thrombosis. Several drugs like high-dose steroids or immunosuppressive agents, mainly azathioprine, are used in the treatment. For patients who do not respond sufficiently to these agents or are not able tolerate them, other options are needed.
PATIENTS: We are presenting 4 cases with parenchymal neuro-Behçet's disease, where commonly used immunosuppressive drugs could not be continued due to intolerance or inefficacy. However, the patients benefited well from mycophenolate mofetil. The benefit was sustained during 3-7 years of follow-up (median 6.5 years).
CONCLUSIONS: Mycophenolate mofetil seems to be an alternative drug in parenchymal neuro-Behçet's disease; however, large controlled studies should be performed for verification of our results.",14,2011-1-1

Sympathetic ophthalmia (SO), also known assympathetic uveitis, is a rare bilateral granulomatous panuveitis that occurs after a penetrating injury to an eye. After injury from either surgery or accident, a variable period of time passes before a sight-threatening inflammation develops in both the eyes. The disease usually responds rapidly to corticosteroid therapy, but recalcitrant cases may require the addition of other immunosuppressive agents. A severely injured eye with no prognosis for vision should be enucleated within 2 weeks of injury to prevent SO. The purpose of this article is to highlight the risks of SO associated with the orbital fractures involving soft tissue components of the orbit. Though unusual, a maxillofacial surgeon, while operating on the orbital walls involving the soft tissue disruption, has to be aware of this condition so that the postoperative complications related to vision can be avoided.",14,2012-Feb-1

To evaluate the potential role of NK1.1 (CD161c) cells in autoimmune uveoretinitis, we treated experimental autoimmune uveoretinitis (EAU)-susceptible mice with anti-CD161c antibodies (PK136) to deplete natural killer (NK) cells. Injection of anti-CD161c antibodies deleted NK cells from the peripheral blood of EAU-susceptible mice. The T cell proliferative response against the ocular autoantigen K2 was not suppressed in mice treated with anti-CD161c antibody when compared with T cells from control mice. Although mice treated with anti-CD161c developed EAU, the clinical severity on days 17 and 19 after induction of EAU was significantly mild in anti-CD161c-treated mice compared with control mice. In addition, the histopathological severity of EAU was significantly milder in mice treated with anti-CD161c antibodies than controls 21 days after induction of EAU. Our results indicate that the severity of EAU is augmented by NK1.1(+) NK cells.",14,2002-Dec-1

Despite extensive clinical research, the etiology of equine recurrent uveitis (ERU) is still unknown. After an immunologic pathogenesis was established in recurrent uveitis in humans, a similar pathogenic mechanism was assumed to exist in ERU. To investigate whether immunopathologic mechanisms are involved in ERU, 20 eyes of 15 horses with ERU were examined immunohistochemically with a T cell marker, B cell marker, and anti-major histocompatibility complex (MHC) class II antibodies. Twenty-six eyes of 20 horses were used for investigation of MHC class II antigen expression in normal equine eyes. In 18 eyes of 14 horses, the number of T cells in the inflammatory cell population within the uvea was assessed. In 16/18 eyes (89%), the T lymphocyte fraction was > 70%. This cell population was distributed mostly in a diffuse manner throughout the uvea and also within the mantle zone of follicular lymphocytic aggregates. Foci of B lymphocytes could be found within the center of follicular aggregates in three eyes. The expression of MHC class II antigen on resident ocular cells was evaluated in 10 eyes of six horses with ERU. An increase of MHC class II antigen expression in the trabecular meshwork and on the nonpigmented ciliary epithelium was noted as was a deviant expression on proliferating Müller cells and retinal pigment epithelial cells. The predominance of T cells in the inflammatory infiltrates supports the central role of a cell-mediated immune response. Furthermore, the observation of a deviant MHC class II expression on resident ocular cells suggests that aberrant immune regulation may play a role in the pathogenesis of ERU.",14,1998-Nov-1

To evaluate the long-term cumulative probability of intraocular pressure (IOP) elevation with the intravitreal dexamethasone implant (IDI) when used to treat different indications: diabetic macular edema, uveitis, retinal vein occlusion.
METHODS: 705 IDI injections (429 eyes) were assessed and Kaplan-Meier graphs were generated to assess: the probability of different levels of IOP elevation (IOP≥21, ≥25 or ≥35 mmHg), IOP change ≥10 mmHg, initiation of IOP-lowering treatment, glaucoma surgery, IOP change with repeat injections and IOP elevation in eyes with glaucoma and ocular hypertension (OHT).
RESULTS: The cumulative probability of IOP ≥21, ≥25 and ≥35 mmHg was 50%-60%, 25%-30% and 6%-7% at 12-24 months, respectively. The probability of initiating IOP-lowering medication was 31%-54% at 12-24 months. Glaucoma and OHT eyes had a higher probability of mild IOP elevation (≥21 mmHg, 65.1%, 75% and 57.8%, p = 0.01), yet a similar moderate (≥25 mmHg, 22.3%, 28% and 30.2%, p = 0.91) and severe elevation of IOP (≥35 mmHg, 3.7%, 7.1% and 4%, p = 0.71) as normal eyes. Glaucoma surgery was required in only 0.9% cases (4/429). At baseline, 8.8% of the treated eyes had glaucoma, 6.7% OHT and 16.9% were already on IOP-lowering medication.
CONCLUSIONS: In the long-term (24 months), IOP elevation is common, generally mild (30% IOP, ≥25 mmHg) and well-tolerated, resolving with topical treatment (54%) and rarely requiring surgery (0.9%).",14,2019-1-1

Adhesion molecules play a central role in leukocyte adhesion to the blood-retinal barrier (BRB) during uveitis. VCAM-1 expression on the BRB has been already described but although structurally similar, ICAM-1 has shown in various autoimmunity models to have distinct role and expression. Here, we induced uveitis in C57Bl/6 mice by adoptive transfer of semi-purified T cells from IRBP1-20-immunized mice. Using Flow cytometry analysis on transferred cells and immunofluorescence staining on retina we have studied the comparative ocular expression of both ICAM-1 and VCAM-1 and their ligands LFA-1 and VLA-4 at the surface of uveitogenic cells. Our results showed that LFA-1 and VLA-4 are expressed on both T and non T cells, VLA-4 sparsely and LFA-1 ubiquitously. Considering retinal expression, ICAM-1 is faintly present and VCAM-1 is absent in naive eyes. Only ICAM-1 is present on infiltrating cells in the retina and vitreous, while only VCAM-1 extends to perivascular glial cells and all along the internal limiting membrane. Finally, ICAM-1 is strongly expressed on the RPE, where VCAM-1 expression is much weaker. VCAM-1 seems most strongly expressed on the internal BRB while ICAM-1 predominates on the external BRB. Those major differences in the expression pattern could represent differential entry pathways for inflammatory cells to penetrate the eye.",14,2015-Aug-1

New and improved diagnostic tests for sarcoidosis-associated uveitis are needed because the currently available laboratory diagnostic biomarkers (eg, lysozyme and angiotensin-converting enzyme [ACE]) are lacking in high sensitivity and specificity.
OBJECTIVE: To compare the value of soluble interleukin 2 receptor (sIL-2R) with ACE as diagnostic biomarkers of sarcoidosis in patients with uveitis.
DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: A cross-sectional retrospective study was conducted using data collected from 249 consecutive patients with uveitis at the Erasmus University Medical Center uveitis outpatient clinic, Rotterdam, the Netherlands, from April 3, 2013, through November 25, 2015. Measurements of sIL-2R and ACE in serum samples and data extraction from patient files were conducted from December 2016 through February 2017, and analysis from April to May 2017.
MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: Serum levels of sIL-2R and ACE and chest radiographic findings were assessed. Receiver operating characteristics analysis was used to determine the probability that individual tests correctly identified patients with sarcoidosis. The Youden Index was used to determine the optimal cutoff points for serum sIL-2R and ACE levels to define sarcoidosis in patients with uveitis.
RESULTS: Data were analyzed from 249 patients with uveitis who had their serum sIL-2R and ACE levels determined and underwent chest radiography. Mean (SD) age at the time of sampling was 51 (16) years, 161 patients (64.7%) were women, and 191 (76.7%) were white. Although patients with sarcoidosis-associated uveitis had the highest mean (SD) serum sIL-2R (6047 [2533] pg/mL) and ACE (61 [38] U/L) levels, elevated serum sIL-2R levels were also found in patients with HLA-B27–associated (4460 [2465] pg/mL) and varicella-zoster virus–associated (5386 [1778] pg/mL) uveitis. Serum sIL-2R and ACE levels were significantly correlated (Pearson correlation coefficient, 0.205; P = .001, 2-sided), but no association was found between uveitis activity and sIL-2R (Spearman rank correlation coefficient [ρ], 0.070, P = .27) nor uveitis activity and ACE (ρ, −0.071; P = .27). The highest Youden index for sIL-2R alone was 0.45, corresponding to an optimal cutoff of 4000 pg/mL and providing 81% (95% CI, 74%-89%) sensitivity and 64% (95% CI, 56%-72%) specificity alone but combined with chest radiography yielded 92% sensitivity and 58% specificity. Chest radiography combined with sIL-2R at a cutoff of 6000 pg/mL resulted in 77% sensitivity and 73% specificity. Combined chest radiography and serum ACE levels at the standard cutoff of 68 U/L resulted in 70% sensitivity and 79% specificity.
CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: This cross-sectional study demonstrates that sIL-2R is a useful marker for diagnosing sarcoidosis in patients with uveitis and has slightly better diagnostic value than ACE.",14,2017-Dec-01

Tubulointerstitial nephritis and uveitis (TINU) syndrome is due to a disregulation of cell-mediated immunity and genetical predisposition due a particular molecular characterization. We report the case of a 50-year-old woman who was admitted for acute renal failure. She had recently taken flurbiprofen for 10 d for recurrent bronchitis. A renal biopsy revealed acute tubulointerstitial nephritis. Prednisone was started and prognosis was favorable. Three months later the patient developed transitory blurred vision. The diagnosis was bilateral uveitis and she received topic and systemic corticosteroid therapy, with resolution of ocular symptoms. Recurrent episodes of uveitis experienced during the next 12 months were treated with same therapy. Genomic haplotype in our patients was HLA A*0278/2631,-B*1517/3802,- Cw*0701/1202, -DRB1*0101/1359 (DRB3* 52), -DQA1*0102/0102, DQB1*0603/0603. TINU syndrome is characterized by tubulointerstitial nephritis that tends to be selflimiting, whereas uveitis tends to relapse. HLA-DQA1*01 and -DQB1*06 haplotypes are strongly associated with TINU syndrome. This is the first report of TINU syndrome induced by flubiprofen intake. Our case emphasizes the importance of the association between drug exposure and strong susceptibility to TINU syndrome giving the molecular characterization.",14,2012-Sep-1

We determined the relative frequencies of the different types of chronic uveitis, and the possible associated conditions, among 400 consecutive patients with chronic uveitis examined during the years 1982 through 1988. Of the 400 patients, 183 (45.75%) had anterior uveitis, 98 (24.5%) ahd panuveitis, 61 (15.3%) had intermediate uveitis, and 58 (14.5%) had isolated posterior uveitis. Only four of the 98 patients with panuveitis (4.1%) were considered idiopathic after a comprehensive examination, whereas 94 of the 183 patients with anterior uveitis (51.4%) were similarly classified. We found an associated condition in 242 of the 400 patients of the study group (60.5%). Of these 242 patients, 61 had Behçet's disease, which constituted the most frequently encountered associated condition in this study. Of the 61 patients with Behçet's disease, 58 had panuveitis and constituted 59.2% of the panuveitis group. Of the 61 patients with intermediate uveitis, 17 (27.9%) had a concurrent disease. An associated condition was found in 95% and 96.2% of patients with unilateral and bilateral panuveitis, respectively, but in none of the patients with unilateral intermediate uveitis. Environmental, cultural, or genetic factors may be accountable for the differences discovered between our findings and those of previously published studies from the United States and England with respect to relative frequencies of some of the associated diseases in patients with chronic uveitis.",14,1991-Aug-15

Use of antioxidants to mitigate oxidative stress during ocular inflammatory diseases has shown therapeutic potential. This work examines a nanoscale therapeutic modality for the eye on the base of antioxidant enzyme, superoxide dismutase 1 (SOD1), termed ""nanozyme."" The nanozyme is produced by electrostatic coupling of the SOD1 with a cationic block copolymer, poly(L-lysine)-poly(ethyleneglycol), followed by covalent cross-linking of the complexes with 3,3'-dithiobis(sulfosuccinimidylpropionate) sodium salt. The ability of SOD1 nanozyme as well as the native SOD1 to reduce inflammatory processes in the eye was examined in vivo in rabbits with immunogenic uveitis. Results suggested that topical instillations of both enzyme forms demonstrated anti-inflammatory activity; however, the nanozyme was much more effective compared to the free enzyme in decreasing uveitis manifestations. In particular, we noted statistically significant differences in such inflammatory signs in the eye as the intensities of corneal and iris edema, hyperemia of conjunctiva, lens opacity, fibrin clots, and the protein content in aqueous humor. Clinical findings were confirmed by histological data. Thus, SOD1-containing nanozyme is potentially useful therapeutic agent for the treatment of ocular inflammatory disorders.",14,2015-1-1

Blood-retinal barrier cells are known to exhibit a massive phenotypic change during experimental autoimmune uveitis (EAU) development. In an attempt to investigate the mechanisms of blood-retinal barrier (BRB) breakdown at a global level, we studied the gene regulation of total retinal cells and retinal endothelial cells during non-infectious uveitis.
METHODS: Retinal endothelial cells were isolated by flow cytometry either in Tie2-GFP mice (CD31
RESULTS: Retinal endothelial cell sorting in wild type C57BL/6 mice was validated by comparative transcriptome analysis with retinal endothelial cells sorted from Tie2-GFP mice, which express GFP under the control of the endothelial-specific receptor tyrosine kinase promoter Tie2. RNA-Seq analysis of total retinal cells mainly brought to light upregulation of genes involved in antigen presentation and T cell activation during EAU. Specific transcriptome analysis of retinal endothelial cells allowed us to identify 82 genes modulated in retinal endothelial cells during EAU development. Protein expression of 5 of those genes (serpina3n, lcn2, ackr1, lrg1 and lamc3) was validated at the level of inner BRB cells.
CONCLUSION: Those data not only confirm the involvement of known pathogenic molecules but further provide a list of new candidate genes and pathways possibly implicated in inner BRB breakdown during non-infectious posterior uveitis.",14,2020-Mar-17

Aqueous humor (AH) samples from 14 patients with presumed tuberculous uveitis (PTU), and 30 control patients were assayed for the proinflammatory cytokines interleukin IL-4, IL-12, IL-15, IL-17, interferon (IFN)-γ, and tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-α, the immunosuppressive cytokine IL-10, and the chemokines GRO-α/CXCL1, IL-8/CXCL8, MIG/CXCL9, IP-10/CXCL10 and SDF-1/CXCL12 with the use of a multiplex assay. Among cytokines, IL-4 and IL-12 were not detected. IL-15, IL-17, IFN-γ, TNF-α and IL-10 levels in AH were significantly higher in patients than in controls (p<0.001; p=0.004; p<0.001; p<0.001; p<0.001, respectively). Among chemokines, SDF-1 levels did not differ significantly between patients and controls, whereas GRO-α, IL-8, MIG and IP-10 levels were significantly higher in patients than in controls (p=0.001; p<0.001; p<0.001; p<0.001, respectively). Mean GRO-α levels in AH of PTU patients were 6-fold higher than IL-8 levels and mean IP-10 levels were 15-fold higher than MIG levels. Clinical disease activity correlated significantly with the levels of IL-15, IFN-γ, TNF-α and IP-10. Logistic regression analysis demonstrated a significant positive association between PTU and high levels of IFN-γ, IL-8, MIG and IP-10. These data suggest that both T helper (Th) Th(1) and Th(17) cells are involved in PTU and that the cytokine profile is polarized toward a Th(1) response. GRO-α and IP-10 might be involved in neutrophil and activated T lymphocyte chemoattraction in PTU, respectively.",14,2012-Aug-1

Uveitis may exist as a clinical manifestation of an underlying systemic disease or may represent an idiopathic entity, sometimes with a very characteristic pattern. Different forms of uveitis have been defined on the basis of three important variables: chronicity, anatomic location, and underlying etiology. The evolving understanding of the immune system has resulted in a more targeted approach to manage patients with different forms of uveitis, although clearly this approach is at a very early stage. Altered patterns of cellular processing and different cytokine expression, including TNF, IL-1, IL-2, IL-6, and IL17, have been defined in uveitis, and this has laid the pathway for targeted therapy. Furthermore, approved biologic therapies for some of the more common autoimmune illnesses have now been tested in uveitis. Adalimumab and infliximab have been the best studied anti-TNF agents and indeed have now been recommended by an expert panel as the first line of treatment for ocular manifestations of Behçet's disease and the second line of treatment for other forms of uveitis. Adalimumab has been recently approved for intermediate uveitis, posterior uveitis, and panuveitis. Other biologic agents have been tested, including daclizumab, a monoclonal antibody directed against IL-2, anti-IL1, and anti-IL-6 receptor agents and therapies that block antigen-presenting cell and T-cell interaction, such as abatacept. In small case series, other biologics such as interferon and rituximab have also been evaluated. Although these biologic therapies have provided a larger armamentarium to treat uveitis, challenges remain. Uveitis is not a disease, but a manifestation of many potential systemic diseases that may have specific individual therapeutic targets. Identification and characterization of these underlying diseases are not always possible and, more importantly, the most effective therapies for each entity have not been defined. In this study, an approach to manage patients with uveitis is presented and current therapy is reviewed.",14,2016-Apr-1

Uveitis is a group of inflammatory ocular conditions that cause significant visual morbidity around the world. Many of the cases of blindness secondary to uveitis can be avoided with adequate and aggressive management of the intraocular inflammation. Steroids have been utilized in the treatment of noninfectious uveitis for more than 60 years, but their chronic use is associated with severe ocular and systemic side-effects. Ophthalmologists are often not familiar with the systemic steroid-sparing agents available for the management of ocular inflammation and depend primarily on the use of corticosteroids. In this article, we review the most common agents utilized in the treatment of uveitis and their side-effect profiles.",14,2014-1-1

A retrospective comparative case series was studied to determine whether the use of prostaglandin (PG) analogues to treat raised intraocular pressure (IOP) in patients with uveitis resulted in an increase in the frequency of anterior uveitis or cystoid macular oedema (CMO).
METHODS: 163 eyes of 84 consecutive patients with uveitis and raised IOP treated with a PG analogue at two tertiary referral uveitis clinics were identified over a 3-month period. Control eyes were selected as those uveitic eyes of the same patients, which were treated with topical IOP-lowering agent(s) other than a PG analogue. Pretreatment IOP was compared with the mean IOP during PG analogue treatment. The frequency of anterior uveitis and CMO during PG analogue treatment was compared with the frequency of these complications in the control eyes during non-PG IOP-lowering treatment.
RESULTS: Significant IOP reductions were observed during PG analogue treatment. There was no significant difference in the frequency of anterior uveitis in those eyes treated with PG analogues and those treated with non-PG agents (p = 0.87, Fisher exact test). None of the 69 uveitic eyes without a previous history of CMO developed this complication. There was no increase in the frequency of visually significant CMO during PG treatment compared with that during non-PG treatment (p = 0.19, Fisher exact test).
CONCLUSION: This study demonstrates that PG analogues are potent topical medications for lowering raised IOP in patients with uveitis and are not associated with increased risk of CMO or anterior uveitis.",14,2008-Jul-1

Intermediate uveitis is an intraocular inflammation involving the anterior vitreous, peripheral retina and pars plana. It usually affects patients from 5 to 30 years old, without gender or racial preferences. The etiology is unknown but there are several associated diseases: multiple sclerosis, idiopathic optic neuritis, autoimmune corneal endotheliopathy, sarcoidosis, thyroid diseases and inflammatory bowel diseases. Symptoms are blurry vision, floaters and distortion of central vision. The syndrome is bilateral in 80% of the patients and chronic with periods of exacerbation and remission. Clinical presentation includes: mild to moderate anterior chamber inflammation, thin keratic precipitates in the inferior portion of the cornea, autoimmune endotheliopathy, vitreitis, vasculitis in the peripheral retina, intravitreal ""snowballs,"" retinal ""snowbanking,"" optic neuritis and cystoid macular edema. Cataract and glaucoma are frequent complications. Treatment of intermediate uveitis is based on periocular and oral corticosteroids. Cryotherapy or laser photocoagulation of the peripheral retina are options in patients with snowbanking when there is an insufficient response to periocular or systemic corticosteroids. Imunosuppression may also be used when other therapies fail, and Cyclosporin A is the first drug of choice. Pars plana vitrectomy is indicated in patients with chronic significant inflammation, non-responsive cystoid macular edema, non-clearing vitreous hemorrhage, tractional retinal detachment and epiretinal membranes. The long-term prognosis of intermediate uveitis is usually good, particularly with strict control of inflammation and with proper management of complications. Patients can often maintain a vision of 20/50 or better.",14,2005-1-1

Uveitis is an inflammatory disorder of the uveal tract of the eye that can affect both adults and children. Non-infectious uveitis can be an expression of a systemic autoimmune condition, or it can be idiopathic. It is a serious disease, associated with possible severe complications leading to visual impairment and blindness. For this reason, a prompt diagnosis and assessment of an appropriate treatment, with the collaboration of specialists such as ophthalmologists and rheumatologists, are extremely important. Many treatment options may be associated to side effects; therefore, clinicians should follow a stepladder approach starting with the least aggressive treatments to induce remission of inflammation. In this review, we reported the current evidence-based treatments for non-infectious uveitis in pediatric and adult patients with particular attention to the biologic response modifier treatment options. Important multicenter studies have demonstrated the efficacy of adalimumab, both in adults (VISUAL I, VISUAL II, VISUAL III) and in children (SYCAMORE, ADJUVITE), while for other agents data are still scarce.",14,2019-Jul-1

To evaluate the changes in health-related and vision-related quality of life (HR-QoL and VR-QoL) in patients with Behçet uveitis (BU) receiving infliximab therapy.
METHODS: Twenty patients with recurrent BU attacks were enrolled. All patients were treated with infliximab. We evaluated the mean number of uveitis attacks and the mean score of extraocular manifestations by Behçet disease current activity form (BDCAF) during the 6 months before and the 6 and 12 months after initiation of infliximab. The EuroQol-5D questionnaire (EQ-5D) and the 25-item National Eye Institute Visual Function Questionnaire (NEI VFQ-25) were self-administered in all patients before treatment and, 6 and 12 months after treatment. Patients' pre- and post-treatment EQ-5D and NEI VFQ-25 scores were compared.
RESULTS: By the 6- and 12-month follow-up, the frequency of uveitis attacks and the BDCAF scores was significantly decreased compared with the 6 months before starting infliximab (p<0.0001). Fully completed questionnaires were received from all patients. Infliximab therapy was associated with a significant improvement of the EQ-5D (p<0.0001), NEI VFQ-25 composite score (p=0.0001), general health score (p=0.0001) and mental health score (p=0.0001). This result shows a significant decrease in inflammatory activity of the disease and consequently improvement in HR-QoL and VR-QoL scores with a rising response pattern in all dimensions.
CONCLUSIONS: Relief of uveitis attacks and extraocular manifestations by infliximab therapy significantly improved the HR-QoL and VR-QoL in patients with BU.",14,2013-Mar-1

To describe the clinical presentation of uveitis with coincident onset of raised and indurated tattooed skin.
DESIGN: Case series.
METHODS: Seven consecutive patients were evaluated at a tertiary ophthalmologic facility with coincident uveitis and cutaneous tattoo induration over an 18-month period. All subjects underwent complete ophthalmic examination and a focused systemic medical evaluation including serologic testing and imaging studies. Two participants underwent biopsy of their tattoos. The patients' clinical courses and responses to treatment over a follow-up period of 1-20 months are reported (mean follow-up = 9 months). Main outcome measures included degree of intraocular inflammation, ocular complications, visual acuity, clinically observable tattooed skin changes, and biopsy results.
RESULTS: Five of 7 patients had bilateral nongranulomatous anterior uveitis: 4 with chronic and 1 with recurrent disease. The remaining 2 patients had bilateral chronic granulomatous panuveitis. Biopsies of raised and indurated tattoos were performed in 2 patients and demonstrated noncaseating granulomatous inflammation surrounding tattoo ink in the dermis. The skin changes resolved in all patients, with a faster response noted in those treated with high-dose oral prednisone for intraocular inflammation. Five patients subsequently experienced recurrent flares of intraocular inflammation in conjunction with the recurrence of raised and indurated tattoos.
CONCLUSIONS: These cases represent a subset of patients in whom skin tattooing may have incited an immune response leading to simultaneous inflammation of the eyes and tattooed skin.",14,2014-Sep-1

To analyze the incidence and clinical course of patients developing progressive ocular inflammation following anti-tubercular therapy (ATT) for presumed ocular tuberculosis (TB).
METHODS: Retrospective analysis of medical records of patients who received ATT for presumed ocular TB and completed at least 12 months follow-up after initiation of ATT. The diagnosis of presumed ocular TB was based on presence of ocular signs suggestive of TB, evidence of past tubercular infection, and exclusion of mimicking clinical entities. All patients received a combination of ATT and corticosteroid therapy. Primary outcome measure was progression (worsening) of ocular inflammation, defined as a two-step increase in level of inflammation (anterior chamber/ vitreous) or the appearance of new lesions following initiation of ATT.
RESULTS: A total of 106 patients (64 male, 42 female) received ATT for presumed ocular TB. Twenty-six (24.5%) patients developed progressive intraocular inflammation following ATT. Primary diagnoses in these patients were: anterior uveitis (n=1), intermediate uveitis (n=9), retinal vasculitis (n=3), serpiginous-like choroiditis (n=7), multifocal choroiditis (n=2), and pan-uveitis (n=4). Following progressive inflammation, diagnosis was revised in two patients (7.7%)-both responded to alternative therapy. Of the rest, majority (n=16; 61.5%) resolved with escalation of corticosteroid therapy. Five patients (19.2%)-all having intermediate uveitis-required therapeutic vitrectomy for resolution. Three patients (11.5%) had persistent inflammation at end of follow-up period.
CONCLUSION: Progressive inflammation following ATT for presumed ocular TB is common. It generally resolves on escalation of corticosteroid therapy. Cases not responding to increased immunosuppression need to be re-investigated to rule out a nontubercular cause.",14,2013-May-1

Ocular inflammation is a common pathological condition of a series of retinal degenerative diseases. Tetramethylpyrazine (TMP), a Chinese herbal extraction, is widely used in the treatment of several ocular diseases in Eastern countries. However, the exact mechanisms correlating the vision protective effects of TMP have not been elucidated. Thus, this study aimed to investigate TMP's molecular targets in anti-inflammatory activity in endotoxin lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-induced retinal inflammation both in vitro and in vivo. The primary cultured retinal microglial cells were pretreated with TMP and then activated by LPS. We found pretreatment with TMP significantly inhibited LPS-induced upregulation of CD68, a marker of mononuclear microglia activation. The morphological changes induced by LPS were also inhibited by the TMP pretreatment. Moreover, Toll like receptor 4 (TLR4), phosphorylation of inhibitor of NF-κB alpha (p-IκB-α) and the translocation of nuclear factor kappa B p65 (NF-κB p65) were significantly downregulated in retinal microglial cells with TMP pretreatment, which indicated that TMP might suppress LPS-induced retinal microglial activation through TLR4/NF-κB signalling pathway. And these results were confirmed in vivo. Pretreatment with TMP inhibited microglial activation, migration and regeneration, especially in ganglion cell layer (GCL). In addition to the inhibition of TLR4, TMP significantly inhibited the translocation of NF-κB p-65 to the nucleus in vivo. The downstream genes of NF-κB, such as the pro-inflammatory cytokines interleukin-6 (IL-6), tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNF-α) and interleukin-1β (IL-1β), were significantly downregulated by TMP pretreatment in the retina. Accordingly, the increased expression of cleaved caspase-3 and the decreased ratio of B-cell lymphoma-2 (Bcl-2) to Bcl-2 associated X Protein (Bax) were significantly attenuated by TMP. TUNEL assay also demonstrated that TMP exerted neuroprotective effects in the retina. Therefore, this study elucidated a novel mechanism that TMP inhibits retinal inflammation by inhibiting microglial activation via a TLR4/NF-κB signalling pathway.",14,2020-Aug-1

Domestic Cat Hepadnavirus (DCH) is a novel virus recently identified in the domestic cat. Currently, little is known regarding its clinical significance. The hepadnaviridae family includes the Hepatitis B Virus (HBV). Co-infection of HBV and Hepatitis C in humans increases the risk of uveitis. We aimed to determine whether DCH is present in the United Kingdom (UK) and whether DCH warrants investigation as a potential cause of uveitis in cats.
PROCEDURES: Clinical records from the Royal Veterinary College (RVC) and the Animal Health Trust (AHT) were reviewed for feline cases diagnosed with endogenous uveitis. A healthy control group was identified from cats presented to the RVC as blood donors. DNA was extracted from stored blood samples using commercially available kits. Polymerase chain reaction assays were performed to confirm the presence of feline DNA and to detect the presence of DCH DNA using previously described protocols.
RESULTS: Blood samples were available from 65 cats with endogenous uveitis and 43 healthy control cats. Two blood samples from cats with endogenous uveitis tested positive for the presence of DCH DNA. DCH DNA was not detected in the control group. There was no statistically significant difference between the prevalence of DCH between the groups.
CONCLUSIONS: Domestic Cat Hepadnavirus is present in the UK. This study failed to demonstrate a conclusive link between DCH and uveitis in cats, although further studies to investigate an association with other feline diseases are warranted.",14,2022-Mar-1

To analyze demographic, clinical and genetic features of Behçet's disease (BD) in Tunisia and to compare them with other ethnic and geographic groups.
METHODS: Two hundred and sixty patients with BD (International Study Group criteria) received in the Department of Internal Medicine of the University Hospital La Rabta in Tunisia, from 1987 to 2006, were retrospectively studied. Demographic, clinical, and genetic data were recorded and analyzed using SPSS 11.0.
RESULTS: The cohort consisted of 188 males and 72 females (M/F = 2.61). The mean age at the onset of the disease was 29 years. Oral and genital ulcers (GU) were seen in 100% and 83% respectively. The most other common clinical features of BD were ocular involvement (51%), arthritis (38.8%), venous thrombosis (33%) and neuropsychiatric symptoms (24.2%). Only 1.5% had gastrointestinal lesions. HLA-B51 frequency was significantly higher in patients with BD (54% vs. 25.5% in healthy controls, p < 0.05). DVT and pseudofolliculitis were significantly more frequent in men whereas arthritis and erythema nodosum were significantly more frequent in women. DVT was also significantly more frequent in patients with GU and those with neurological involvement. GU, positive pathergy test and DVT were significantly less frequent in patients with ocular involvement. Neurological involvement consisted of 47 cases with CNS parenchymal lesions and 22 with cerebral vascular lesions (13 had both lesions); HLA B51 was significantly less frequent in patients with neurological involvement.
CONCLUSION: Our series was characterized by particular aspects such as high frequency of DVT and neuropsychiatric involvement, and rare occurrence of gastrointestinal lesions. The results confirm the ethnic and geographic variation of BD expression.",14,2007-1-1

Uveitis (intraocular inflammation) is a leading cause of loss of vision. Although its aetiology is largely speculative, it is thought to arise from complex genetic-environmental interactions that break immune tolerance to generate eye-specific autoreactive T cells. Experimental autoimmune uveitis (EAU), induced by immunization with the ocular antigen, interphotoreceptor retinoid binding protein (IRBP), in combination with mycobacteria-containing complete Freund's adjuvant (CFA), has many clinical and histopathological features of human posterior uveitis.

To evaluate the risk of adverse effects and to demonstrate short-term results after selective laser trabeculoplasty (SLT) in glaucoma patients.
METHODS: Sixty-four eyes of 64 patients with primary open-angle glaucoma, not sufficiently treated with local antiglaucomatous therapy, were included in this prospective study. Intraocular pressure (IOP), anterior chamber cells, anterior chamber flare, and vitreous haze (according to the Standardization of Uveitis Nomenclature Working Group) were examined before SLT, for 24 hours, 14 days, 6 weeks, and 3 months after laser. Furthermore, macular thickness measurements in 9 Early Treatment Diabetic Retinopathy Study subfields, including central subfield, measured by Spectralis OCT were performed. The differences between prelaser and postlaser values were obtained.
RESULTS: The average of mean preoperative IOP measurement was 19.1±3.972 mm Hg compared with 12.9±2.513 (P<0.001), 13.2±3.331 (P<0.001), 14.1±2.731 (P<0.001), and 13.9±2.922 mm Hg (P<0.001) 24 hours, 14 days, 6 weeks, and 3 months post-SLT, respectively. The central subfield preoperatively was 278.14±74.355 µm compared with 277.14±71.461 (P=0.177), 277.14±71.461 (P=0.354), 287.34±74.363 (P=0.414), and 257.45±68.431 µm (P=0.214) 24 hours, 14 days, 6 weeks, and 3 months after treatment. Anterior chamber cells, anterior chamber flare, and vitreous haze were not denoted at any time of examination.
CONCLUSIONS: In this study, no significant increase in macular thickness and no other adverse effects were present. Furthermore, SLT was found to significantly lower IOP in glaucoma patients in addition to local therapy. In conclusion, SLT has a good ability to reduce IOP with a minor risk of adverse effects.",14,2014-Feb-1

To examine the role of tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF) in the induction of experimental autoimmune uveoretinitis (EAU), the authors compared in vivo TNF production in EAU-susceptible and EAU-resistant strains of congenic mice and attempted to determine whether TNF can enhance the inflammation in EAU by injection of TNF at the time of immunization.
METHODS: The production of TNF after stimulation with lipopolysaccharide (LPS) in B10.A and B10.D2 mice was measured by bioassay with L929 cells. The incidence and severity of EAU was compared between the group immunized with conventional methods and the group that alternatively received additional subcutaneous injection of recombinant human TNF (rhTNF) at the time of immunization in both B10.A and B10.D2 mice.
RESULTS: Serum concentration of TNF after stimulation with 50 micrograms of LPS was significantly higher in B10.A mice than in B10.D2 mice. The incidence of EAU in B10.A mice was 60%, but it was only 10% in B10.D2 mice using the conventional method. Extremely severe chorioretinitis and iridocyclitis occurred in B10.A mice with the injection of rhTNF at the time of immunization for EAU. The incidence of EAU in B10.A and B10.D2 rose to 100% and 40%, respectively. When administered alone, rhTNF did not cause any inflammatory change in the uvea.
CONCLUSIONS: The rhTNF was found to enhance the immune response to interphotoreceptor retinoid-binding protein in mice. These results suggest that susceptibility to EAU is in some part mediated by the ability of mice to produce TNF.",14,1994-Oct-1

To study retinal thickness (RT) and choroidal thickness (CT) in patients with inactive uveitis. We also investigated the correlation between RT and CT and the duration and frequency of inflammation and visual acuity in patients with inactive uveitis.
METHODS: One-hundred and forty-eight eyes from 97 patients (mean age 51.0 ± 15.7 years) and 98 eyes from 55 normal subjects (mean age 59.3 ± 14.4 years) were studied. Routine ophthalmic examination included spectral-domain optical coherence tomography with enhanced depth imaging of the retina and choroid. CT was measured from the outer border of the retinal pigment epithelium to the inner scleral border at 500-µm intervals of the horizontal section between 2.5 mm temporal and 2.5 mm nasal to the fovea. RT was measured between the inner limiting membrane and the retinal pigment epithelium.
RESULTS: Mean subfoveal RT did not differ significantly between uveitis patients and controls. Mean CT at multiple locations was significantly lower in patients with uveitis compared to normal subjects; this difference was most significant at the fovea (uveitis group, 229 ± 85 µm vs. control group, 276 ± 74 µm; p < 0.001). Only CT was associated with duration and frequency of inflammation in patients with anterior uveitis (r = -0.298, p = 0.008; r = -0.349, p = 0.002, respectively).
CONCLUSION: CT is reduced in patients with inactive uveitis and is associated with disease duration and frequency whereas RT does not seem to be affected by disease processes.",14,2017-Apr-1

Our aim was to compare surgical outcomes of trabeculectomy and nonvalved glaucoma-drainage-device (GDD) implantation in eyes with chronic inflammatory glaucoma and uncontrolled intraocular pressure (IOP).
METHODS: A retrospective chart review was conducted on patients with glaucomatous optic neuropathy, chronic anterior or posterior segment inflammation, and ≥6 months postoperative follow-up. All eyes underwent trabeculectomy with either antifibrotic therapy or implantation of a Baerveldt GDD (Abbott Laboratories Inc., Abbott Park, IL, USA). Failure was defined as IOP >21 mmHg, <20 % reduction below baseline or IOP <5 mmHg on two consecutive follow-up visits after 3 months, reoperation for glaucoma, or loss of light-perception vision. Statistical methods consisted of Student's t tests, χ(2) test, and Kaplan-Meier time to failure analysis.
RESULTS: Nineteen trabeculectomies of 42 patients were followed for a mean of 31 ± 23 and 23 GDD eyes for a mean of 39 ± 19 months (P = 0.22). At last follow-up, mean IOP (11.83 ± 4.59 and 13.15 ± 6.11 mmHg, P = 0.45) and number of glaucoma medications (1.28 ± 1.56 and 1.26 ± 1.25, P = 0.97) were similar between the trabeculectomy and GDD groups. The frequency and types of postoperative complications in both groups were similar. The cumulative probability of failure after 5 years of follow-up was significantly greater in trabeculectomy eyes (62 %) compared with GDD eyes (25 %) (P = 0.006).
CONCLUSIONS: Nonvalved tube-shunt surgery was more likely to maintain IOP control and avoid reoperation than trabeculectomy with antifibrotic therapy in eyes with chronic inflammatory glaucoma.",14,2015-May-1

Non-infectious uveitis mainly affects the working-age population and can contribute to significant social and economic burden. It comprises a heterogeneous group of conditions with varied aetiology. Precise and early diagnosis, excluding masquerade syndromes, is the key to early therapeutic intervention. Treatment should be appropriately selected according to the anatomical sites of inflammation, the diagnosis and known prognosis, and whether there is a systemic inflammatory drive. Corticosteroids in the form of local or systemic therapy form the mainstay of treatment; however, due to unacceptable side effects, the need for long-term use or suboptimal response, corticosteroid-sparing medications may need to be considered early on in the management of non-infectious uveitis. With newer insights into the immunopathology of uveitis and the availability of biologic agents, treatment can be tailored according to individual needs. Many patients have systemic involvement, and hence a multidisciplinary approach is often required to achieve the best outcome in an individual. Patient involvement in the management of non-infectious uveitis, ensuring compliance, and continual monitoring of both the treatment and therapeutic response are the key to achieving optimal outcomes.",14,2016-Jan-1

To determine classification criteria for Fuchs' uveitis syndrome.
DESIGN: Machine learning of cases with Fuchs' uveitis syndrome and 8 other anterior uveitides.
METHODS: Cases of anterior uveitides were collected in an informatics-designed preliminary database, and a final database was constructed of cases achieving supermajority agreement on the diagnosis, using formal consensus techniques. Cases were split into a training set and a validation set. Machine learning using multinomial logistic regression was used on the training set to determine a parsimonious set of criteria that minimized the misclassification rate among the anterior uveitides. The resulting criteria were evaluated on the validation set.
RESULTS: One thousand eighty-three cases of anterior uveitides, including 146 cases of Fuchs' uveitis syndrome, were evaluated by machine learning. The overall accuracy for anterior uveitides was 97.5% in the training set and 96.7% in the validation set (95% confidence interval 92.4, 98.6). Key criteria for Fuchs' uveitis syndrome included unilateral anterior uveitis with or without vitritis and either: 1) heterochromia or 2) unilateral diffuse iris atrophy and stellate keratic precipitates. The misclassification rates for Fuchs' uveitis syndrome were 4.7% in the training set and 5.5% in the validation set, respectively.
CONCLUSIONS: The criteria for Fuchs' uveitis syndrome had a low misclassification rate and appeared to perform well enough for use in clinical and translational research.",14,2021-Aug-1

Sight-threatening intraocular inflammation affecting the posterior segment of the eye may be predominantly located in the peripheral retina and vitreous (intermediate uveitis) or postequatorially where it manifests as inflammation of the retina, retinal vessels and/or optic nerve with cellular infiltration of the choroid and retina and edema particularly at the macula. Involvement of the macula is the main cause for visual loss. Experimental models of posterior uveitis have revealed much concerning the mechanisms of inflammatory cell damage to the retina, implicating CD4 T cells, effector macrophages and pro-inflammatory cytokines. In particular, transgenic and gene deletion models of inflammation have allowed an understanding of how immune privilege in the posterior segment of the eye is disrupted. Importantly, this has led to the development of new treatments with novel immunosuppressants and 'biologics' and the promise of cell-based therapies which may allow customized therapies tailored to the individual's inflammatory profile.",14,2007-1-1

Uveitides can be due to non-infectious and infectious etiologies. It has been observed that there is a gender difference with a greater preponderance of non-infectious uveitis in women than in men. This review will describe both non-infectious and infectious uveitides and describes some of the current autoimmune mechanisms thought to be underlying the gender difference. It will specifically look at non-infectious uveitides with systemic involvement including juvenile idiopathic arthritis, spondyloarthopathies, sarcoidosis, Behçet’s disease, and Vogt-Koyanagi-Harada disease and at uveitides without systemic involvement including sympathetic ophthalmia, birdshot chorioretinitis, and the white dot syndromes. Infectious uveitides like acute retinal necrosis, progressive outer retinal necrosis, and cytomegalovirus mediated uveitis will be mentioned. Different uveitides with female- or male- predominance are presented and discussed.",14,2015-1-1

Interphotoreceptor retinoid-binding protein was found to be highly uveitogenic in primates. All six monkeys immunized with bovine interphotoreceptor retinoid-binding protein developed ocular inflammation. The main clinical changes were sheathing of retinal vessels and deep well-circumscribed yellow-white lesions. Histologic changes in the retina included shortening of the outer segments and foci of inflammation, which extended through all retinal layers. Particularly profound were the choroidal changes, such as severe inflammatory infiltration, which often formed focal granulomas with epithelioid and giant cells. Some granulomas had the structure of Dalen-Fuchs nodules. These structures and other histologic changes in the monkeys closely resemble those in uveitic conditions in humans, such as sympathetic ophthalmia or Vogt-Koyanagi-Harada syndrome.

To evaluate the long-term results of intravitreal dexamethasone implant (DEX) for noninfectious uveitis.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: The study included 62 eyes of 44 patients treated with DEX implant due to noninfectious uveitis and followed up for at least a year. Best-corrected visual acuity (BCVA), central foveal thickness, intraocular pressure (IOP), vitreous haze score, indications, immunomodulatory therapy and steroid usage before/after injection, number of injections, and adverse events were analyzed retrospectively.
RESULTS: Average follow-up was 20 months (range 12-64 months). The female/male ratio was 29/15. Mean age was 50 years (range 22-75 years). The most frequent uveitis etiologies were idiopathic (25 patients, 40.3%) and Behçet’s uveitis. (17 patients, 27.4%) The most common indication for DEX injection was cystoid macular edema together with resistant vitreous haze (26 eyes, 41.9%). Twenty-two eyes (30%) received more than one DEX injection. Mean BCVA was improved from 0.55 logMAR at baseline to 0.38, 0.32, and 0.35 after 1, 3, and 6 months, respectively (p<0.001 for each). Mean CFT was decreased from 386 μm at baseline to 288, 311, and 302 μm after 1, 3, and 6 months, respectively (p<0.001 for each). Mean IOP did not change significantly during follow-up. Five eyes (8%) received topical anti-glaucoma medication (IOP ≥25 mmHg). Eighteen (46%) of 39 phakic eyes underwent cataract surgery during follow-up. Similar efficacy of the DEX implant was observed in eyes that received multiple injections. Systemic immunomodulatory therapy did not change significantly during follow-up.
CONCLUSION: Intravitreal DEX injection does not alter systemic immunomodulatory therapy, but may facilitate the management of noninfectious uveitis by suppressing local intraocular inflammation. Multiple injections yielded comparable visual and anatomical outcomes to single injections. Follow-up for ocular hypertension and cataract formation are important, especially in eyes receiving multiple injections.",14,2019-Oct-24

To evaluate diagnostic utility of aqueous humor analysis in animals with anterior uveitis.
ANIMALS: Client-owned dogs (n = 12) and cats (n = 10).
PROCEDURES: Examination findings and diagnostic test results including aqueous humor cytology were compared.
RESULTS: Disease duration prior to aqueocentesis was not significantly different between dogs with idiopathic anterior uveitis and those with an etiologic diagnosis, but was shorter in cats with feline infectious peritonitis (FIP) than those with idiopathic uveitis. Microbial nucleic acids, antigens, or antibodies against them were seldom found in blood/serum; however, serum feline coronavirus titers ≥1:6400 were detected only in cats with FIP. Aqueous humor cytology was diagnostic in no cats and two dogs, both with neoplasia. Although aqueous humor contained predominantly neutrophils in cats with FIP and large reactive lymphocytes and plasma cells appeared more frequent in cats with idiopathic uveitis, neither clinical nor cytologic assessment of anterior chamber contents differed significantly between cats with idiopathic or FIP-associated uveitis. Cytologically assessed plasma cell number was correlated with keratic precipitates and disease duration. Clinically detectable hyphema and cytologic erythrocyte number were correlated. However, cytologic cell grades and clinical grade of flare or cell numbers within the anterior chamber were not correlated.
CONCLUSIONS: Aqueous humor cytology permitted diagnosis of neoplasia in dogs with anterior uveitis but was generally not helpful in cats. Poor correlation between clinical and cytologic assessment of cell numbers and type within the anterior chamber dictates that clinical grading should not be the sole criterion for electing to perform aqueocentesis.",14,2014-May-1

TNF-alpha inhibitory drugs are widely used with beneficial effect in the treatment of rheumatic diseases, such as juvenile idiopathic arthritis and ankylosing spondylitis. Due to the complex immune regulatory function of TNF-alpha, induction of inflammation in several organs including the eye, skin, and gastrointestinal tract has been reported. This report describes the occurrence of intraocular inflammation after treatment with the TNF-alpha antagonist etanercept.
METHODS: In this observational case series, we followed and examined six patients receiving etanercept for juvenile idiopathic arthritis, ankylosing spondylitis, adult Still's disease, or psoriasis.
RESULT: All patients responded well to their joint affliction, but developed endogenous uveitis for the first time after application of etanercept. Following acute intervention with corticosteroids, etanercept was discontinued and instead an antibody-based anti-TNF treatment using infliximab was instituted. We documented visual acuity before and after change from etanercept to treatment with the anti-TNF-alpha antibody infliximab. Interestingly, prompt long-term remission (mean 34 months) of uveitis without recurrence could be induced in all patients.
CONCLUSIONS: Our observations may indicate that immunodysregulatory and even proinflammatory effects of etanercept are of relevance in clinical practice. Further randomized controlled clinical trials are necessary to investigate possible side effects of anti-TNF therapy using etanercept and infliximab.",14,2010-Aug-1

Non-infectious uveitis (NIU) is an intractable, recurrent, and painful disease that is a common cause of vision loss. Available treatments of NIU, such as the use of topical corticosteroids, are non-specific and have serious side effects which limits them to short-term use; however, NIU requires long-term treatment to prevent vision loss. Therefore, a single dose therapeutic that mediates long-term immunosuppression with minimal side effects is desirable. In order to develop an effective long-term therapy for NIU, an adeno-associated virus (AAV) gene therapy approach was used to exploit a natural immune tolerance mechanism induced by the human leukocyte antigen G (HLA-G). To mimic the prevention of NIU, naïve Lewis rats received a single intravitreal injection of AAV particles harboring codon-optimized cDNAs encoding HLA-G1 and HLA-G5 isoforms one week prior to the induction of experimental autoimmune uveitis (EAU). AAV-mediated expression of the HLA-G-1 and -5 transgenes in the targeted ocular tissues following a single intravitreal injection of AAV-HLA-G1/5 significantly decreased clinical and histopathological inflammation scores compared to untreated EAU eyes (p < 0.04). Thus, localized ocular gene delivery of AAV-HLA-G1/5 may reduce the off-target risks and establish a long-term immunosuppressive effect that would serve as an effective and novel therapeutic strategy for NIU, with the potential for applications to additional ocular immune-mediated diseases.",14,2019-Dec-27

Short chain fatty acids (SCFAs) are produced by gut microbiota as fermentation products of digestion-resistant oligosaccharides and fibers. Their primary roles are functioning as major energy sources for colon cells and assisting in gut homeostasis by immunomodulation. Recent evidence suggests that they affect various organs both at cellular and molecular levels, and regulate functions in distance sites including gene expression, cell proliferation, cell differentiation, apoptosis and inflammation. In this study, we examined whether SCFAs are present in the mouse eye and whether SCFAs affect inflammatory responses of the eye and retinal astrocytes (RACs). We observed that intra-peritoneal injected SCFAs were detected in the eye and reduced intraocular inflammation induced by lipopolysaccharide (LPS). Moreover, SCFAs displayed two disparate effects on LPS-stimulated RACs - namely, cytokine and chemokine production was reduced, but the ability to activate T cells was enhanced. Our results support the existence of gut-eye cross talk and suggest that SCFAs can cross the blood-eye-barrier via the systemic circulation. If applied at high concentrations, SCFAs may reduce inflammation and impact cellular functions in the intraocular milieu.",14,2021-May-1

A toxoplasmic uveitis case was reported on the focus of impairment of pathological findings and serological antibody titers after chemotherapy. A chief complaint of a 60-year-old male was a decreased and blurred vision in his right eye for 2 weeks after experiencing tremendous stress and fatigue. A steroid therapy for 3 weeks was not effective and the retinal lesion became necrotic. Anti-Toxoplasma gondii antibody titer was checked to be a strong positive by both ELISA and indirect latex agglutination assay (ILA). He was treated with Fansidar F for 8 weeks. His vision improved as the necrotic lesion healed by scarring, but the antibody titers still remained very high without any signs of negative conversion. It is suggested to be a recurrent case of the past asymptomatic infection by presumed immune suppression caused by excessive stress.",14,2000-Mar-1

In Behcet's disease (BD), interleukin (IL)-6 drive the immune-mediated inflammatory process. The IL-6 receptor can be targeted using tocilizumab. As an off-label treatment, we tested its efficacy in patients with BD.
METHODS: Overall, 4 patients with refractory BD were treated with tocilizumab, 8mg/kg/4 weeks. Patients were clinically and biologically assessed before administering each dose and the literature was reviewed.
RESULTS: Tocilizumab was found to be safe and well tolerated. BD activity decreased significantly in all patients, and prednisone dose was reduced in all cases (up to 50% of the baseline dose). Treatment appeared effective in alleviating skin/mucosal effects, neurological involvement, and uveitis, but less effective for arthralgia and abdominal pain. A very short time lag between the onset of treatment with tocilizumab and the clinical response was observed. The literature review revealed 11 previous cases reporting improvement to BD with this treatment, and 3 previous cases without efficacy.
CONCLUSIONS: We reported the most important study treating refractory BD with tocilizumab; this treatment could be safe and efficient, but will require further evaluation by randomized clinical trials.",14,2016-Jun-1

Ocular involvement in Behçet disease (BD) is characterized by recurrent inflammatory attacks and spontaneous resolution of acute inflammatory signs. Both frequency and severity of uveitis attacks determine the magnitude of irreversible damage to intraocular structures and long-term visual prognosis. Recurrent attacks of occlusive retinal vasculitis lead to vision-threatening complications such as cystoid macular edema, retinal neovascularization, optic atrophy and retinal atrophy. This manuscript updates about the role of various drugs in the management of BD, discussing corticosteroids, disease modifying immunosuppressive drugs, and finally biologicals (anti-TNF-blocking agents and alpha interferon) which seem to be superior compared to all other available drugs in preventing loss of vision. Also recent findings from new biologicals will be summarized, and especially the role of these drugs in children will be discussed in detail. The authors suggest that at least moderate to severe retinal involvement should become treated with biologicals whenever available.",14,2014-Feb-1

Immunosuppressive drugs currently available for the treatment of autoimmune diseases display a narrow therapeutic window between efficacy and toxic side effects. The use of combinations of drugs that have a synergistic effect may expand this window and reduce the risk of toxicity. We evaluated the combination effect of rapamycin (Rapa) and cyclosporin A (CsA) in an autoimmune disease model of the eye. The dose-effect relationship of Rapa with CsA was measured in vitro on the inhibition of proliferation of retinal S-Ag-primed lymphocytes. A median effect analysis was performed and a combination index (CI) calculated for 50% inhibition of proliferation. Rapa and CsA were markedly synergistic over a wide dose range (lowest CI = 0.31). Calculated dose reduction factors indicated that Rapa could be reduced nine-fold and CsA reduced five-fold when these drugs were used in combination. These reduced doses were tested in vivo for the treatment of experimental autoimmune uveoretinitis (EAU). Twelve of 15 rats treated with CsA, 2 mg/kg/day, developed EAU with a median severity of 2.5. Fourteen of 15 rats treated with Rapa, 0.01 mg/kg/day, developed EAU with a median severity of 3.25. Complete inhibition of EAU was achieved in all 15 animals treated with the combination of Rapa and CsA (combined vs CsA alone, p < 0.0002; combined vs Rapa alone, p < 0.00001). The demonstrated synergistic relationship between Rapa and CsA will allow the use of reduced doses of each drug to achieve a therapeutic effect. The use of lower doses may reduce the toxicity of these drugs for the treatment of autoimmune uveitis.",14,1995-Jan-15

The autoimmune phenomena and the autoantibody profile have acquired great importance in ulcerative colitis (UC). Few studies have explored antinuclear antibodies (ANAs) prevalence, but not its association with steroid dependence. We hypothesized that ANAs could be a factor associated to steroid dependence.
METHODS: Ninety-seven consecutive patients with UC were included. ANA titers and staining patterns were determined by indirect immunofluorescence. Gender, age, follow-up time, C-reactive protein (CRP), disease extent, Mayo Score Activity Index, extraintestinal manifestations, and steroid dependence were analyzed in univariate and multivariate models.
RESULTS: Ninety-seven patients were included and 49 (50.5%) were females; mean age was 41.7 +/- 22.2 years. Positivity for ANAs was encountered in 52 (53.5%) patients, and none for anti-dsDNA. The prevalence of ANAs was higher in steroid-dependent than in nonsteroid-dependent patients (77.8% versus 48.1%, P = 0.020; odds ratio [OR] = 3.8, 95% confidence interval [CI] 1.1-12.5), and in those with uveitis (100% versus 51.1%; P = 0.040) or pyoderma gangrenosum (100% versus 51.6%; P = 0.078). No association was observed with gender, age, CRP, disease extent, and Mayo Score Activity Index. The multiple regression analysis model showed an association between steroid dependence and ANAs (P = 0.033, OR = 3.9, 95% CI 1.4-14.9).
CONCLUSIONS: ANAs are associated with steroid dependence in UC patients. Further studies are required to determine the role of ANAs as serological markers for prediction of steroid dependence in order to perform early therapeutic interventions with biological agents.",14,2009-Jul-1

Equine recurrent uveitis (ERU) has always been and still is an important disease with a significant impact on the horse industry in Europe, with a prevalence of 8-10%. The need to understand and manage the disease has spurred the development of veterinary ophthalmology in general, although the aetiology of the disease remains the subject of intense discussion. It is most probably an autoimmune disease triggered, at least in Europe, in the majority of cases by Leptospira spp. The therapy of ERU has evolved over the centuries from various methods of bloodletting to rational medical therapy using mydriatics and steroidal and nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs, to surgical therapies, such as vitrectomy or implantation of cyclosporin-releasing devices. In Europe, pars plana vitrectomy in horses testing positive for Leptospira spp. appears to be the most successful form of therapy at the present time.",14,2010-Mar-1

Over a five-year period 245 patients with uveitis were investigated at the Uveitis Clinic, Sydney Eye Hospital, for possible aetiological and relevant disease associations. Uveitis was anterior in 75% of patients, posterior in 21% and generalized in 4%. Anterior uveitis (AU) was idiopathic in 52% of cases. In patients tested for the HLA-B27 antigen, 47% were HLA-B27 positive, including all cases of ankylosing spondylitis (8% of cases) and Reiter's syndrome (3% of cases). There was a marked male predominance in patients with AU, especially in HLA-B27 positive individuals. Posterior uveitis (PU) was most frequently unilateral, chronic and idiopathic (24% of cases), whilst recognizable aetiologies included toxoplasmosis (20%), Behcet's syndrome (14%), sarcoidosis (12%) and pars planitis (12%). The peak age of onset in patients presenting with AU was 30 to 40 years, whilst patients with PU presented a decade earlier.

Behçet's disease (BD) is a chronic recurrent systemic inflammatory disorder of unknown etiology characterized by oral and genital ulcerations, skin lesions, and uveitis. The ocular involvement of BD, or Behçet's uveitis (BU), is characterized by panuveitis or posterior uveitis with occlusive retinal vasculitis and tends to be more recurrent and sight threatening than other endogenous autoimmune uveitides, despite aggressive immunosuppression. Although pathogenesis of BD is unclear, researches have revealed that immunological aberrations may be the cornerstone of BD development. General hypothesis of BD pathogenesis is that inflammatory response is initiated by infectious agents or autoantigens in patients with predisposing genetic factors and perpetuated by both innate and acquired immunity. In addition, a network of immune mediators plays a substantial role in the inflammatory cascade. Recently, we found that the immunopathogenesis of BU is distinct from other autoimmune uveitides regarding intraocular effector cell profiles, maturation markers of dendritic cells, and the cytokine/chemokine environment. In addition, accumulating evidence indicates the involvement of Th17 cells in BD and BU. Recent studies on genetics and biologics therapies in refractory BU also support the immunological association with the pathogenesis of BU. In this review, we provide an overview of novel findings regarding the immunopathogenesis of BU.",14,2014-1-1

Clinical toxoplasmosis was diagnosed in 15 cats by correlating serologic evidence of infection and clinical signs to either response to therapy or histopathologic demonstration of the organism. Ophthalmic manifestations, primarily involving the anterior segment, were common. Other common physical examination abnormalities included muscle hyperesthesia, fever, and weight loss. Response to therapy was variable, but administration of clindamycin hydrochloride resulted in resolution of all clinical signs not involving the eyes in surviving animals. This drug, alone or in combination with corticosteroids, led to total resolution of clinical signs in four of four cats with active retinochoroiditis and in six of nine cats with anterior uveitis. Four of the 15 cats had concurrent infection with feline immunodeficiency virus (FIV). Feline leukemia virus antigen or antibodies to feline infectious peritonitis virus were not detected.",14,1989-1-1

Genetic association of some immune-mediated human uveitic diseases with histocompatibility antigens, ethnic origin, familial background, or gender have suggested the presence a hereditary component in susceptibility. Experimental autoimmune uveoretinitis (EAU) can be induced in inbred rodents by immunization with evolutionarily conserved retinal proteins, and mimics many features of human uveitis. Susceptibility to EAU is genetically controlled, and the model is being used to study mechanisms that might affect susceptibility to ocular autoimmune disease. EAU expression in mice and in rats requires the presence of both a susceptible MHC haplotype and a ""permissive"" genetic background. MHC control of susceptibility in H-2k mice was tentatively mapped to the I-A subregion (HLA-DR equivalent), implicating epitope recognition as a major mechanism in susceptibility. In contrast, expression of the I-Ek gene product (HLA-DQ equivalent) appeared to have an ameliorating effect on disease. Susceptible H-2 haplotypes exhibited highest disease scores on the B10 background, and disease was reduced, or even absent, on some other (nonpermissive) backgrounds. Factors which may determine ""permissiveness"" or ""nonpermissiveness"" of a particular genetic background, as studied in mice and rats, may include regulation of responses to lymphokines, hypothalamic-adrenal-pituitary axis hormones, mast cell/vascular effects, and possibly the T cell repertoire. The data are interpreted to suggest that, in individuals susceptible to uveitis by virtue of their MHC, the final expression of disease will be determined by the genetic background. These results might help to explain why only a minority of individuals with a susceptible HLA type develop uveitis, as well as the variable incidence of disease in HLA-identical populations of different ethnic backgrounds.",14,1992-1-1

Nucleotide oligomerization domain-2 (NOD2) plays an important role in innate immunity to sense muramyl dipeptide (MDP), a component of bacterial cell walls. Notably, NOD2 is linked to eye inflammation because mutations in NOD2 cause a granulomatous type of uveitis called Blau syndrome. A mouse model of NOD2-dependent ocular inflammation was employed to test the role of a cytokine strongly implicated in granuloma formation, IFN-gamma, in order to gain insight into downstream functional consequences of NOD2 activation within the eye triggering uveitis.
METHODS: Mice deficient in IFN-gamma, NOD2, or CD11b and their wild-type controls were treated with intravitreal injection of MDP in the presence or absence of IFN-gamma. IFN-gamma production in the eye was measured by ELISA. The intravascular inflammatory response within the iris was quantified by intravital microscopy.
RESULTS: NOD2 activation resulted in the production of IFN-gamma within the eye. Deficiency in IFN-gamma diminished the development of MDP-induced uveitis, indicating its crucial role in downstream inflammatory events triggered by NOD2. Moreover, exogenous IFN-gamma markedly exacerbated MDP-induced ocular inflammation in a NOD2-dependent mechanism. The potential of IFN-gamma to enhance inflammation required the adhesion molecule CD11b because CD11b-deficient mice failed to show the synergistic effects of IFN-gamma and MDP cotreatment on adhering and infiltrating cells.
CONCLUSIONS: IFN-gamma was identified as a downstream mediator of NOD2-driven inflammation and the capacity of IFN-gamma in vivo to enhance the inflammatory potential of NOD2 was demonstrated. Extrapolation of these findings in mice suggests that the dysregulation of IFN-gamma may occur in patients with Blau syndrome, thereby contributing to the granulomatous nature of the disease.",14,2009-Apr-1

Inflammation is a key component of chronic and acute diseases of the eye. Our goal is to test anti-inflammatory genes delivered by an adeno-associated virus (AAV) vector as potential treatments for retinal inflammation. We developed a secretable and cell penetrating form of the caspase activation and recruitment domain (CARD) from the apoptosis-associated speck-like protein containing a CARD (ASC) gene that binds caspase-1 and inhibits its activation by the inflammasome. The secretion and cell penetration characteristics of this construct were validated in vitro by measuring its effects on inflammasome signaling in a monocyte cell line and in an retinal pigmented epithelium (RPE) cell line. This vector was then packaged as AAV particles and tested in the endotoxin-induced uveitis mouse model. Gene expression was monitored one month after vector injection by fluorescence fundoscopy. Ocular inflammation was then induced by injecting lipopolysaccharide into the vitreous and was followed by enucleation 24 hours later. Eyes injected with the secretable and cell penetrating CARD AAV vector had both a significantly lower concentration of IL-1β as well as a 64% reduction in infiltrating cells detected in histological sections. These results suggest that anti-inflammatory genes such as the CARD could be used to treat recurring inflammatory diseases like uveitis or chronic subacute inflammations of the eye.",14,2015-May-1

Appaloosa horses are predisposed to equine recurrent uveitis (ERU), an immune-mediated disease characterized by recurring inflammation of the uveal tract in the eye, which is the leading cause of blindness in horses. Nine genetic markers from the ECA1 region responsible for the spotted coat color of Appaloosa horses, and 13 microsatellites spanning the equine major histocompatibility complex (ELA) on ECA20, were evaluated for association with ERU in a group of 53 Appaloosa ERU cases and 43 healthy Appaloosa controls. Three markers were significantly associated (corrected P-value <0.05): a SNP within intron 11 of the TRPM1 gene on ECA1, an ELA class I microsatellite located near the boundary of the ELA class III and class II regions and an ELA class II microsatellite located in intron 1 of the DRA gene. Association between these three genetic markers and the ERU phenotype was confirmed in a second population of 24 insidious ERU Appaloosa cases and 16 Appaloosa controls. The relative odds of being an ERU case for each allele of these three markers were estimated by fitting a logistic mixed model with each of the associated markers independently and with all three markers simultaneously. The risk model using these markers classified ~80% of ERU cases and 75% of controls in the second population as moderate or high risk, and low risk respectively. Future studies to refine the associations at ECA1 and ELA loci and identify functional variants could uncover alleles conferring susceptibility to ERU in Appaloosa horses.",14,2014-Jun-1

Autoimmune uveitis is a sight-threatening, rare disease, potentially leading to blindness. Uveitis is a synonym for intraocular inflammation, presenting as various clinical phenotypes with different underlying immune responses in patients, whereas different animal models usually represent one certain clinical and immunological type of uveitis due to genetic uniformity and the method of disease induction. T cells recognizing intraocular antigens initiate the disease, recruiting inflammatory cells (granulocytes, monocytes/macrophages) to the eyes, which cause the damage of the tissue. The treatment of uveitis so far aims at downregulation of inflammation to protect the ocular tissues from damage, and at immunosuppression to stop fueling T cell reactivity. Uveitis is usually prevented by specific mechanisms of the ocular immune privilege and the blood-eye-barriers, but once the disease is induced, mechanisms of the immune privilege as well as a variety of novel regulatory features including new Treg cell populations and suppressive cytokines are induced to downregulate the ocular inflammation and T cell responses and to avoid relapses and chronicity. Here we describe mechanisms of regulation observed in experimental animal models as well as detected in studies with peripheral lymphocytes from patients.",14,2019-Nov-1

To determine the changes in the expression profiles of microRNAs (miRNAs) in retinas during the development of experimental autoimmune uveoretinitis (EAU) in rats.
METHODS: The levels of interleukin-1β (IL-1β) and monocyte chemoattractant protein-1 (MCP-1) were measured in aqueous humour samples and supernatants of homogenised posterior eye cups obtained from Lewis rats immunised with interphotoreceptor retinoid binding protein peptide (R14) and complete Freund's adjuvant. Microarray analysis was performed to determine the miRNA profiles in the retina of eyes with EAU on days 0 (baseline), 7, 14 and 21 after immunisation.
RESULTS: The levels of IL-1β and MCP-1 in the aqueous humour and the supernatants of posterior eye cups were significantly elevated in eyes with EAU, and the levels corresponded with the stage of the EAU. On day 14 after immunisation, the expressions of nine miRNAs (miRNA-223, 142-5p, 142-3p, 21, 146a, 146b, 1949, 1188-3p and 193) were significantly elevated, and the expressions of four miRNAs (miRNA-181a, 183*, 124* and 331) were downregulated relative to the baseline. Quantitative PCR analyses confirmed the elevation of miRNA-223 and miRNA-146 and the downregulation of miRNA-181a in retinas with EAU on day 14 after immunisation. In situ hybridisation confirmed increased expression of miR-223 and miR-146 in retinas with EAU.
CONCLUSIONS: Several miRNAs were significantly increased or decreased in retinas during the course of EAU. The expression of miR-223 and miR-146a corresponded with the clinical score of the EAU and elevation of IL-1β/MCP-1 in the eye with EAU. Further studies are required to clarify the role of miRNA in eyes with autoimmune uveoretinitis.",14,2016-Mar-1

Little is known about the ocular penetration of echinocandin antifungals. We studied the ocular distribution of systemically administered caspofungin in a rabbit uveitis model.
METHODS: Caspofungin (1 mg/kg per day) was given intravenously to rabbits as a single dose or as repeated daily doses on 7 days starting 24 h after induction of unilateral uveitis by intravitreal endotoxin injection. Caspofungin concentrations were determined by high-performance liquid chromatography in the cornea, aqueous humor, vitreous humor, and serum 4, 8, 16, and 24 h after administration of a single dose and 24 h after the last of seven doses.
RESULTS: The mean caspofungin concentration in the aqueous of the inflamed eye 4 and 8 h after single-dose administration was 1.30 +/- 0.39 microg/ml and 1.12 +/- 0.34 microg/ml, respectively. Drug concentrations decreased to 0.24 +/- 0.09 microg/ml at 16 h and 0.26 +/- 0.14 microg/ml at 24 h. In the vitreous of inflamed eyes drug levels were undetectable at all time points. No drug was found in the aqueous of inflamed eyes 24 h after the last of seven repeated doses, and the vitreous only contained trace amounts. In the corneas of inflamed eyes concentrations reached 1.64 +/- 0.48 microg/g at 4 h, peaked at 2.16 +/- 1.14 microg/g at 8 h, and declined to 1.87 +/- 0.52 microg/g and 1.49 +/- 0.48 microg/g at 16 and 24 h, respectively. After repeated dosing, corneal concentrations of caspofungin were 0.8 and 1.0 microg/g and below the limit of detection in two of four animals. In non-inflamed eyes no drug was detectable in the aqueous and vitreous humor, and the corneas at any time point.
CONCLUSIONS: In our model, caspofungin reached therapeutically relevant levels in the aqueous and cornea but not in the vitreous humor of inflamed eyes. Intraocular drug deposition was critically dependent on a disrupted blood-eye barrier. These findings suggest a limited role for caspofungin in the treatment of fungal endophthalmitis.",14,2007-Jun-1

A novel multiplex polymerase chain reaction (PCR) test (Strip PCR) for 24 common ocular infectious disease pathogens was established. Solid-phase techniques provide stable, prompt, and accurate results while using less sample amount with lower cost than conventional quantitative real-time PCR (qPCR). Strip PCR for infectious uveitis was optimized and evaluated using intraocular samples.
DESIGN: Evaluation of diagnostic testing.
METHODS: We examined 722 samples at 14 institutions. Genomic DNA from aqueous humor and vitreous fluid was analyzed by qPCR and Strip PCR. Clinical diagnosis was determined based on symptoms, clinical findings, and laboratory tests. MainOutcomeMeasures: The diagnostic parameters of the Strip PCR were based on qPCR results.
RESULTS: Strip PCR showed low intra- and inter-institutional variability even when performed by technicians with various PCR skill levels. The targets of Strip PCR for infectious uveitis were optimized for 9 major pathogens (herpes simplex virus [HSV] 1, HSV2, varicella-zoster virus, human T-cell lymphotropic virus 1, human herpesvirus 6, Epstein-Barr virus, cytomegalovirus, Toxoplasma gondii, and Treponema pallidum) with 772 intraocular samples. The Strip PCR successfully detected pathogen DNA at concentrations ranging from 10
CONCLUSIONS: Easy-to-use Strip PCR is recommended for rapid diagnosis of infectious uveitis, as its results are equivalent to that of conventional qPCR.",14,2020-May-1

To investigate the effect of interferon alfa-2a on T regulatory (Treg) cells, T helper 17 (Th17) cells, and expression of Toll-like receptors (TLRs) in Behçet disease (BD) patients with uveitis.
METHODS: Twenty-seven patients who received interferon alfa-2a for active BD uveitis despite conventional immunomodulatory therapies and healthy controls were enrolled. Peripheral blood Treg and Th17 cell frequencies were determined by flow cytometry as gated cells for CD3+CD4+Foxp3+ and CD3+CD4+IL17A+, respectively. Th17 RAR-related orphan receptor (ROR)γt mRNA expression was verified by real-time PCR (RT-PCR). Treg and Th17 cell cytokines were detected by ELISA in the supernatant of short-term cell cultures. RT-PCR was used to assess expression of TLR-2, TLR-3, TLR-4, TLR-8, and TLR-9 using cDNA prepared from CD4+ T cells and monocytes.
RESULTS: Treg and Th17 cell frequencies and Th17 RORγt expression were significantly elevated, and IL-10 concentration in Treg cell supernatants was significantly lower in BD patients than in controls. Th17 IL-17, IL-6, IL-21, IL-22, IL-23, IFN-γ, and TNF-α concentrations were significantly higher and all TLR expressions were significantly elevated in patients. Interferon alfa-2a led to a significant reversal in Treg and Th17 cell frequencies, Th17 RORγt expression, Treg and Th17 cell cytokine production, and TLR expression by CD4+ T cells and monocytes.
CONCLUSIONS: Despite a relative increase in Treg cells, impaired IL-10 production suggests that Treg dysfunction may play a role in induction of BD uveitis. Favorable effects of interferon alfa-2a may be associated with recovery of Treg cell function, suppression of Th17 cells, and reduced expression of TLRs on CD4+ T cells and monocytes.",14,2019-Jan-02

PMID: 8045724
Recoverin, a calcium-binding protein that selectively localizes to the retina and pineal gland, has been identified as the target for the putative pathogenic autoimmune process of cancer-associated retinopathy (CAR). The present study was aimed at testing the capacity of recoverin to induce experimental autoimmune uveoretinitis and pinealitis in Lewis rats.
METHODS: Lewis rats were immunized against recombinant myristoylated recoverin by a single footpad injection of the protein, at various doses, emulsified in complete Freund's adjuvant. Development of uveoretinitis was monitored by clinical and histologic examinations, whereas pinealitis was detected by histologic examination.
RESULTS: Immunization with recoverin induced severe panuveitic changes that closely resemble those induced by S-antigen (arrestin). The effect was dose-dependent, with 10 micrograms/rat the lowest immunopathogenic dose. Rats immunized with recoverin also developed pineal inflammation.
CONCLUSION: Recoverin is highly immunopathogenic in Lewis rats. Although the ocular changes induced in rats differ from those seen in CAR, the data recorded here are in line with the concept that recoverin can initiate pathogenic autoimmune processes in the eye.",14,1994-Jul-1

PATIENTS AND METHODS: A systematic search between January 2000 and September 2017 was conducted using PubMed, Embase, and Cochrane libraries. We investigated control of inflammation, improvement of visual acuity (VA), corticosteroid-sparing effect, and adverse events (AEs) or serious adverse events.
RESULTS: Three randomized clinical trials (RCTs) and 20 non-RCTs were included and analyzed. The pooled proportions of inflammation control were 74% (95% CI 64%-82%) and 79% (95% CI 69%-87%) in groups of ≤6- and ≥12-months follow-up durations. No significant difference was found between the two groups (
CONCLUSION: The current review provided evidences that ADA might be a promising choice in reducing inflammatory activity, gaining VA, and sparing corticosteroid use with minor AEs when applied in treating non-infectious uveitis.",14,2018-1-1

Three hundred and fifteen patients with anterior uveitis and juvenile chronic arthritis were reviewed in order to determine the incidence, visual prognosis, and the clinical characteristics of the intraocular inflammation. The overall incidence of uveitis was 20%. Approximately 25% of patients had relatively mild and/or transient involvement and an excellent visual prognosis. In 50% the uveitis was more severe but could be controlled with topical medication. In the remaining 25% the visual prognosis was poor due to the intractable nature of the uveitis and the subsequent development of vision-threatening complications. The majority of patients (74%) were under the age of 8 years when the uveitis was first diagnosed. Clinically, the intraocular inflammation was most frequently an asymptomatic, chronic, non-granulomatous, iridocyclitis which was bilateral in 71% of cases. Other ocular lesions, which were rare, included keratoconjunctivitis sicca and corneal melting.",14,1988-1-1

To determine whether the inflammation of endotoxin-induced uveitis (EIU) and experimental autoimmune uveoretinitis (EAU) alters key in vivo and in vitro parameters of ocular immune privilege.
METHODS: For EIU induction, C3H/HeN mice received 200 microg lipopolysaccharide (LPS). For EAU induction, B10.A mice were immunized with 50 microg interphotoreceptor retinoid-binding protein (IRBP) mixed with complete Freund's adjuvant. Aqueous humor (AqH) was collected at periodic intervals and assayed for leukocyte content and the ability to suppress or enhance T-cell proliferation. Eyes with EAU were assessed for the capacity to support anterior chamber (AC)-associated immune deviation (ACAID) induction after injection of ovalbumin (OVA).
RESULTS: Inflammation within the anterior segment in EIU peaked at 12 to 24 hours and was detected from 10 days onward in EAU. In AqH of EIU, protein content rose within 4 hours, followed by infiltrating leukocytes. EIU AqH promptly lost its capacity to suppress T-cell proliferation and became mitogenic for T cells. In AqH of EAU, protein and leukocyte content rose at 11 days and continued to remain elevated thereafter. Whereas 11-day EAU AqH failed to suppress T-cell proliferation, AqH at later time points reacquired immunosuppressive properties. Injection of OVA into the AC of eyes of mice with EAU failed to induce ACAID.
CONCLUSIONS: The intraocular inflammation of EIU and EAU disrupted important parameters of immune privilege, ranging from breakdown of the blood- ocular barrier, to loss of an immunosuppressive microenvironment, to abrogation of ACAID. Because AqH from inflamed EAU reacquired the ability to suppress T-cell proliferation, the authors conclude that the capacity to regulate immune expression and inflammation can be a property even of inflamed eyes.",14,1999-Aug-1

To assess the usefulness of polymerase chain reaction (PCR) in detection of bacteria in ocular samples.
METHODS: Thirty-seven samples (aqueous and vitreous) were collected from 25 eyes showing typical symptoms and clinical signs of bacterial endophthalmitis. Ocular samples were also collected from 38 eyes that underwent routine surgery and from 15 eyes with intraocular inflammation due to nonbacterial causes. Panbacterial PCR was performed with a nested pair of 16S rRNA gene primers. Subsequent bacterial identification was completed for 18 paired samples (nine eyes) using restriction fragment length polymorphism (RFLP) and DNA sequencing.
RESULTS: A 100% concordance was obtained between PCR and culture-positive samples. A PCR product was amplified from all 37 intraocular samples from eyes with suspected infection, whereas only 15 of 22 vitreous samples and 5 of 15 aqueous samples were culture positive. Culture-negative PCR-positive samples contained a preponderance of gram-negative bacterial sequences. Cloning and DNA analysis revealed 30 DNA sequences and included eight bacterial 16S rDNA, which currently remain unidentifiable. The presence of bacterial DNA was associated with an inflammatory response suggestive of infection and not colonization. All 15 samples from inflamed eyes with diverse uveitis diagnoses were PCR negative. The false-positive rate, due to contamination during sampling, was 5%.
CONCLUSIONS: Bacterial DNA was detected in all patients with typical clinical signs of endophthalmitis. Gram-negative organisms seem to play a much more important role in the pathogenesis of this disease than previously thought. PCR-based techniques have great value in the confirmation of the diagnosis of bacterial endophthalmitis especially in culture-negative eyes.",14,2000-Oct-1

To describe the clinical characteristics of uveitis occurring in patients with psoriasis and to compare them with patients with idiopathic anterior uveitis and HLA-B27-associated anterior uveitis.
DESIGN: Case-control study.
METHODS: The charts of 36 patients with a diagnosis of uveitis and psoriasis visiting the Immunology and Uveitis Service at the Massachusetts Eye and Ear Infirmary between January 2000 and December 2001 were reviewed. Clinical characteristics, therapy, and outcomes of uveitis were compared with 30 randomly selected patients with either idiopathic anterior uveitis or with HLA-B27-associated anterior uveitis.
RESULTS: The mean age at presentation for uveitis was significantly higher in patients with psoriasis compared with nonpsoriatic groups (44.6 years in HLA-B27-psoriatic patients vs 35.9 years in HLA-B27- nonpsoriatic patients, P = .034; 52.7 years in HLA-B27+ psoriatic vs 35.7 years in HLA-B27+ nonpsoriatic patients, P = .001). Uveitis in patients with psoriasis also tended to be bilateral (62%) and prolonged (11.2 weeks). HLA-B27+ patients with psoriasis required supplemental therapy with oral nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (95% confidence interval [CI] 1.41 to 5.36, P = .003) for anterior uveitis more often than did the HLA-B27+ nonpsoriatic group. Patients with psoriasis and uveitis who were HLA-B27+ required oral NSAIDs (95% CI 1.51 to 9.79, P = .001) for anterior uveitis more often than did HLA-B27- psoriatic patients.
CONCLUSION: Uveitis in patients with psoriasis may have distinguishing clinical features. Further epidemiologic studies are required to determine the strength of association between psoriasis without arthritis but with uveitis.",14,2005-Jan-1

To develop Toxoplasma gondii B1 gene polymerase chain reaction (PCR) for use with aqueous humor of cats, and to report PCR and antibody detection results in naturally exposed cats with and without uveitis.
SAMPLE POPULATION: Serum and aqueous humor samples from client-owned, healthy cats (n = 23) and client-owned cats with uveitis (n = 43).
PROCEDURE: T gondii-specific IgM and IgG were measured in serum and aqueous humor from all cats. The Goldman-Witmer coefficient for ocular antibody production was calculated for cats positive for T gondii-specific IgM or IgG in aqueous humor. Aqueous humor from all cats was assessed by the B1 gene PCR.
RESULTS: T gondii was detected in aqueous humor by PCR from 2 of 23 (8.7%) healthy cats and 8 of 43 (18.6%) cats with uveitis. T gondii-specific IgM in either serum or aqueous humor was detected in 5 of 8 (62.5%) cats with uveitis and T gondii in aqueous humor. All cats with uveitis and T gondii in aqueous humor had anterior segment disease. In 5 of 8 (62.5%) cats with uveitis and T gondii in aqueous humor, ocular production of T gondii antibodies was not detected. T gondii was not detected in aqueous humor from 14 of 17 (82.4%) cats with ocular production of T gondii-specific antibody.
CONCLUSIONS: The presence of T gondii in aqueous humor may correlate to clinical disease in some, but not all, cats.
CLINICAL RELEVANCE: T gondii-specific aqueous humor antibody tests and PCR should be used together to aid in the diagnosis of ocular toxoplasmosis in cats.",14,1996-Nov-1

The purpose of this study was to describe the EDI-OCT findings in an acute phase of sympathetic ophthalmia (SO). A 24-year-old gentleman was referred to clinic complaining of progressive blurry vision of his right eye within last 3 days. He had a history of repaired corneoscleral laceration in his left eye followed by lensectomy and anterior vitrectomy approximately 1 month before his recent right eye discomfort. Physical examination revealed a granulomatous uveitis with an exudative RD of the right eye consistent with SO. EDI-OCT was done at initial exam and repeated 1 and 15 months after therapy. EDI-OCT 1 month following therapy showed significant improvement in choroidal thickening and outer retinal cell layers. The choroidal thickness in the right sympathizing eye decreased from 617 to 568 μm and in the left exciting eye from 539 to 521 μm. After 15 month follow-up, choroidal thickness that is reported in EDI-OCT is 436 μm in the right and 382 μm in the left eye. SO should be added to the list of choroidopathies that cause an increase in choroidal thickness in acute phase of disorder with subsequent decrease after therapy, so help us in assessing and estimation of response to treatment.",14,2015-Jun-1

Cystoid macular edema (CME) can cause profound visual loss and is one of the major causes of legal blindness in patients with uveitis. It can complicate virtually any type of acute or chronic, anterior or posterior uveitis. When mild and of short duration, CME may respond to treatment used to control the intraocular inflammation. However, patients may need more aggressive treatment with local and systemic steroid therapy and other immunosuppressive drugs. Unfortunately, CME may become refractory to all currently available therapies and result in severe visual loss.",14,2003-Mar-1

To evaluate the responsiveness of the Vision core module 1 (VCM1) vision-related quality of life (VR-QOL) questionnaire to changes in visual acuity in patients with posterior and intermediate uveitis and to validate its use as a clinical end point in uveitis.
METHODS: Logarithm of the minimum angle of resolution visual acuity and VR-QOL using the VCM1 questionnaire were prospectively recorded in 37 patients with active posterior segment intraocular inflammation before starting systemic immunosuppression with ciclosporin, tacrolimus or the anti-tumour necrosis factor (TNF) agent, p55TNFr-Ig, and again 3 months later. Spearman analysis was used to correlate improvements in visual acuity and VR-QOL between baseline and 3 months.
RESULTS: The correlation between changes in visual acuity and VR-QOL was moderate to good for the worse eye (r = 0.47, p = 0.003), but poor for the better eye (r = -0.05, p = 0.91). The responsiveness indices effect size and standardised response mean were 0.57 and 0.59, respectively, showing that the VCM1 questionnaire is moderately responsive to immunsosuppressive therapy for active uveitis.
CONCLUSION: Changes in VR-QOL measured with the VCM1 questionnaire correlated moderately well with changes in the worse eye visual acuity, suggesting that the VCM1 is a valid instrument for monitoring response to treatment in uveitis.",14,2007-Feb-1

To evaluate surgical outcomes and to describe a strategy for pediatric uveitic glaucoma.
DESIGN: Retrospective case series.
METHODS: The clinical practice of a single surgeon identified 36 patients with juvenile uveitic glaucoma (diagnosed before 18 years of age) who underwent 1 or more intraocular pressure (IOP)-lowering surgical procedures. The first eye operated on was included in the analysis. The main indication for success was IOP of less than 21 mm Hg with controlled inflammation, without further IOP-lowering surgery or devastating complication.
RESULTS: Patients with uveitic glaucoma associated with juvenile idiopathic arthritis (n = 20), idiopathic uveitis (n = 9), other (n = 6) were included. Mean age ± standard deviation at initial glaucoma surgery was 11.1 ± 4.4 years with a follow-up of 5.6 ± 4.8 years (range, 0.2 to 16.4 years). Goniotomy was the initial surgical procedure in 31 (86%) eyes. Fifteen eyes did not require further IOP-lowering surgery. Sixteen eyes had additional IOP-lowering surgery: second goniotomy (n = 9), glaucoma drainage device (n = 6), and trabeculectomy (n = 1). By Kaplan-Meier survival analysis, the first versus the first or second goniotomy were successful at 10 years in 48% (95% confidence interval, 28% to 65%) versus 69% (95% confidence interval, 47% to 84%). Goniotomy failure was noncorrelative with phakic status or presence of preoperative synechiae. Five eyes (14%) had initial glaucoma drainage device implantation because of closed angles. Visual acuity was similar between initial and final examinations (0.37 ± 0.48 logarithm of the minimal angle of resolution units [Snellen 20/47] vs 0.28 ± 0.34 logarithm of the minimal angle of resolution units [Snellen 20/38]). IOP was reduced (33.0 ± 8.0 mm Hg vs 12.6 ± 4.5 mm Hg; P < .0001), as was number of glaucoma medications (3.2 ± 1.1 vs 1.2 ± 1.3; P < .0001). Eyes undergoing cataract removal after successful glaucoma surgery maintained IOP control. Glaucoma was controlled and vision was preserved in 33 (92%) eyes.
CONCLUSIONS: Refractory juvenile uveitic glaucoma was managed successfully by goniosurgery and glaucoma drainage device implantation. Cataract removal can be accomplished successfully, provided IOP and uveitis are well controlled before surgery.",14,2013-Jan-1

To describe clinical features, risk factors and complications in a cohort of Swedish children with juvenile idiopathic arthritis (JIA) screened for uveitis between 2002 and 2011.
METHODS: Medical records of 299 children with JIA (93 male, 206 female; median age 5.0 years at diagnosis) were retrospectively scrutinized focusing on subtype of JIA, onset of arthritis/uveitis, presence of antinuclear antibodies (ANA) and ophthalmological status.
RESULTS: Uveitis was found in 32 (11%) children, 78% bilaterally affected. The median age of arthritis onset in children who developed uveitis was 2.5 years (range 1-10) versus 5.0 years (range 1-15) in those who did not. Sex ratio was 3.5:1 (girl:boy). The most prevalent JIA subtype was oligoarthritis (75%). All but one child with uveitis was found to be ANA (+). The median interval between diagnosis of arthritis and uveitis was 12 months. Only one child developed uveitis between the fourth and fifth years after arthritis onset. Ocular complications were recorded in 45.6% (26/57 affected eyes) at last follow-up. On univariate analysis, both young age at arthritis onset and ANA positivity were possible predictors for developing uveitis, but on multivariate analysis, the latter was the most important predictor (HR 16.25, 95%; CI 2.19-120.44; p = 0.006, Cox regression analysis).
CONCLUSION: Almost all of the children developing JIA-associated uveitis did so within 4 years after arthritis onset, a fact that accentuates the importance of early initiation of ophthalmological screening and more frequent regular follow-ups during the first 4 years. The most important predictor for developing uveitis was ANA positivity.",14,2017-Nov-1

Human T-cell lymphotropic virus (HTLV) is the first discovered retrovirus causing malignancy in human. HTLV infection affects host's ocular tolerance and causes various diseases in the eye. Here we discuss the manifestations, mechanisms, treatments, and future directions of HTLV-related ocular diseases. RECENT FININGS: Recent serological researches showed that the number of HTLV-1 carriers in metropolitan area was increasing, although seroprevalence of HTLV-1 in general population was decreased after screening serological tests in blood donors started. The most common clinical entity of uveitis was still HTLV-1 uveitis in HTLV-1 highly endemic area, but prevalence of HTLV-1 uveitis varies in different parts of the world. As for treatment of inflammation, tacrolimus and 5-azacytidine were reported to be effective for autoimmune manifestations in HTLV-1-related overlap syndrome (deratomyositis/Sjogren's syndrome) and HTLV-1-related myelodysplastic syndrome. Interleukin-2 receptor targeted therapies improved scleritis in patients with adult T-cell leukemia/lymphoma caused by HTLV-1. Basic researches identified that HTLV-1 tax and HTLV-1 basic leucine zipper factor play critical roles in the HTLV-1-related disease and are now being investigated as targeted therapies.
SUMMARY: Development of modern molecular biology makes it possible to reveal deep insights of HTLV-1-related ocular diseases. Although effective therapies based on basic researches have been reported, further endeavor is necessary to establish much more specific treatments of the ocular diseases.",14,2012-Nov-1

Experimental autoimmune uveoretinitis (EAU) is a T-cell-mediated autoimmune disease induced by immunization with uveitogenic retinal antigens, or by the adoptive transfer of uveitogenic T-cells of the Th-1-like phenotype. We have previously shown that IFN-gamma-deficient mice (GKO) on the C57BL/6 background are equally susceptible to interphotoreceptor retinoid binding protein (IRBP)-induced EAU as the wild type (WT). In the present study, we evaluated EAU induction in GKO mice by the newly described H-2(b)epitope contained in residues 1-20 of human IRBP, and compared it to the response to the whole IRBP molecule. Similarly to previous observations with IRBP-induced EAU, delayed type hypersensitivity (DTH) and lymphocyte proliferation responses were elevated in GKO mice, as was production of IL-5 and TNF-alpha. However, unlike the responses induced by whole IRBP, there was no detectable IL-10 production to the peptide. Histopathology on day 21 after immunization, revealed that both GKO and WT mice developed retinal lesions, including damage to the photoreceptor cell layer, vasculitis and inflammatory cellular infiltration, but disease scores were significantly higher in GKO, and retinal detachment was observed only in GKO mice. In contrast to the wild type, the cellular infiltrate in eyes of GKO mice contained a prominent component of eosinophils, although of lower proportion in peptide-induced than in IRBP-induced EAU. We conclude that the cytokine and inflammatory responses to human peptide 1-20 differ perceptibly from the responses to whole bovine IRBP, and may explain the elevated EAU scores of GKO mice compared to wild type.",14,2000-Aug-1

Borrelia burgdorferi, the etiologic agent of Lyme disease is a tick born spirochetal infection. Clinical signs of Lyme borreliosis are uncommon in horses, but when present they are often vague and nonspecific. In horses, Lyme borreliosis has been implicated in musculoskeletal, neurological, reproductive, and ocular disorders, including uveitis, but definitive diagnosis can be challenging as the causative agent is rarely isolated and serologic tests can be unreliable and do not confirm active disease. Here, we report two cases of equine uveitis associated with B. burgdorferi based on the identification of spirochetes within ocular fluids and confirmed with PCR testing. The two cases illustrate some of the challenges encountered in the recognition and diagnosis of equine Lyme borreliosis. Although only one of many possible causes of equine uveitis, Lyme disease should be considered a differential diagnosis, especially in endemic areas. Given the possibility for false negative results of serum tests during uveitis associated with B. burgdorferi and the failure of such tests to confirm active infection, a combination of cytologic assessment, antibody, and/or PCR testing of ocular fluids may be worthwhile if the clinical suspicion for Lyme uveitis is high.",14,2012-Nov-1

To report the clinical manifestations and treatment outcomes of patients with presumed intraocular tuberculosis (TB) seen at the Newcastle Uveitis Service, Royal Victoria Infirmary, Newcastle upon Tyne, UK over a 10-year period.
METHODS: Retrospective review of case notes.
RESULTS: A total of 21 patients were identified. Occlusive retinal vasculitis was the commonest ophthalmological presentation (12 patients). Eight patients (38%) were found to have underlying active systemic TB (four with mediastinal lymphadenopathy, three with pulmonary TB, one with cutaneous TB). Constitutional or respiratory symptoms, elevated inflammatory markers, and an abnormal chest radiograph were poor indicators of active TB. Two patients had inactive intrathoracic TB. Eleven patients had latent TB. Eighteen patients received anti-tuberculous treatment. Final visual acuity was better than or equal to initial visual acuity in 14 out of 16 patients who completed at least 6 months of standard anti-tuberculous treatment.
CONCLUSIONS: Most patients with presumed intraocular TB have latent TB, but a significant minority has hitherto undetected active TB. Our series suggests that either proven or presumed intraocular TB occurs frequently in the absence of constitutional or respiratory symptoms, elevated inflammatory markers, or an abnormal chest radiograph. A minimum of 6 months standard anti-tuberculous treatment provides good visual outcomes in the majority of patients.",14,2013-Apr-1

Acute idiopathic tubulointerstitial nephritis (TIN) is considered a condition with a good long-term prognosis. However, there is evidence that some patients develop permanent renal impairment. The aim of this study was to evaluate the clinical characteristics of TIN at the time of diagnosis in children and determine whether the findings upon presentation predict renal outcome. The clinical data and biopsy findings from 26 children with idiopathic TIN admitted to four Finnish university hospitals were analyzed retrospectively. Twenty-five patients (96%) manifested renal insufficiency. After the mean follow-up time of 2.75 years (SD 2.5; 0.9-13.5), 4 patients (15%) had permanent renal insufficiency and 8 patients (31%) had persistent low-molecular weight proteinuria. Uveitis was found in 12 patients (46%). Four of these patients (33%) developed chronic uveitis. Our analysis showed that none of the laboratory or biopsy findings upon presentation prognosticated renal outcome. No correlation between renal disease and uveitis could be found either. The occurrence of uveitis among TIN patients was higher than previously reported. Uveitis may develop late and without recurrence of renal dysfunction. Therefore, follow-up by a pediatrician and by an ophthalmologist is warranted in children with acute TIN for at least 12 months from diagnosis.",14,2011-Feb-1

Behçet's disease (BD) is a systemic inflammatory disorder of unknown etiology, characterised by recurring relapses and remissions. BD manifestations have been thought to be associated with the immunological abnormalities triggered by environmental factors in genetically susceptible individuals. Natural killer (NK) cells are important members of innate immunity with their cytotoxic activity and also cytokine secretions. They have the capacity to induce or dampen immune responses. Different study groups have reported conflicting results about NK cell activity in the BD pathogenesis, however, contribution of NK cells to BD is still unclear.
METHODS: NK cells from BD patients with uveitis (n=11) as well as age- and gender-matched healthy controls (n=9) were purified and intracytoplasmic cytokine levels of TNF-α, IFN-γ, IL-2, IL-4, IL-10, IL-12 and IL-13 were determined.
RESULTS: Increased TNF-α, IFN-γ and IL-2 in relapse period and increased IL-4 as well as a slight increase of IL-10 in remission period were observed.
CONCLUSIONS: Our results show that NK cells are the contributors of BD pathogenesis with their NK1 profile in relapse periods, and also with their NK2 profile in remission periods, in BD patients with uveitis. An increase in IL-10 observed in remission periods may be linked to the regulatory potential of NK cells in the recurrent nature of BD manifestations.",14,2015-1-1

To evaluate optical coherence tomography (OCT) retinal nerve fiber layer (RNFL) measurements in patients with active and quiescent uveitis with and without glaucoma and compare results to the published age-adjusted normative data.
DESIGN: Comparative, retrospective pilot study.
PARTICIPANTS: Consecutive patients with uveitis who underwent OCT RNFL measurements between December 2011 and October 2012 were identified: 76 uveitic eyes without glaucoma and 135 uveitic eyes with glaucoma.
INTERVENTION: We conducted OCT of the RNFL.
MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Global and sectoral RNFL thickness measurements.
RESULTS: In 19 nonglaucomatous, uveitic eyes with active inflammation, mean global and all sectoral RNFL measurements were greater than the normative 95th percentile. The mean global RNFL OCT measurement was 140.5 microns in such eyes compared with 107.8 microns in the 57 nonglaucomatous, quiescent, uveitic eyes (P=0.008). These measurements were significantly higher than the average of 95.3 microns reported in normal eyes (P<0.001). All mean sectoral measurements except superonasal were significantly higher in active compared with quiescent uveitic eyes (P=0.002-0.05). In glaucomatous eyes with both quiescent and active uveitis, the mean global RNFL measurements on OCT were 92.3 and 95.7 microns, respectively. These measurements were significantly higher than the mean global RNFL thickness (65.3 microns) reported in eyes with the same stage (moderate) of nonuveitic glaucoma.
CONCLUSIONS: Uveitis is a major confounding factor in assessing the thickness of the RNFL. A significant thickening of the RNFL was found in patients with active uveitis and a greater RNFL thickness than anticipated in patients with uveitic glaucoma. These data raise concerns about the comparative value of RNFL scans as a method to detect and monitor glaucoma in uveitic eyes.",14,2015-Mar-1

The passage of leukocytes across the blood-retina barrier at the early stages of an inflammatory reaction is influenced by a complex series of interactions about which little is known. In particular, the relationship between hydrodynamic factors, such as shear stress and leukocyte velocity, to the adherence and subsequent extravasation of leukocytes into the retina is unclear. We have used a physiological method, scanning laser ophthalmoscopy, to track labeled leukocytes circulating in the retina, followed by confocal microscopy of retinal flatmounts to detect infiltrating cells at the early stage of experimental autoimmune uveitis. This has shown that retinal vessels are subjected to high shear stress under normal circumstances. During the inflammatory reaction, shear stress in retinal veins is reduced 24 h before leukocyte infiltration. This reduction is negatively correlated with leukocyte rolling and sticking in veins and postcapillary venules, the sites of leukocyte extravasation. Activation of vascular endothelial cells is also a prerequisite for leukocyte rolling and infiltration. In addition, antigen priming of leukocytes is influential at the early stage of inflammation, and this is seen clearly in the reduction in rolling velocity and adherence of the primed leukocytes in activated retinal venules, 9 days postimmunization.",14,2004-Feb-1

Optical coherence tomography (OCT) is becoming the state-of-the-art method for the non-invasive imaging of a variety of ocular diseases. The aim of this study was to assess the application of OCT for the in vivo monitoring and follow-up of pathological changes during experimental autoimmune uveoretinitis (EAU) in rats. Initially we established OCT imaging in healthy brown Norway rats and correlated it with retinal histology. Subsequently, we induced EAU and imaged animals by OCT throughout the pre-peak, peak, and post-peak phases of the disease. The sensitivity of OCT imaging was determined by comparison with clinical EAU and histopathology scores obtained ex vivo at several time points throughout the disease course. Our data demonstrate that OCT imaging of the healthy rat retina closely correlates with histological observations and allows the clear visualization of all retinal layers. After induction of EAU, the first pathological changes could be detected by OCT at day (d) 8 post-immunization (p.i.) which corresponded to the time point of clinical disease onset. An increase in retinal thickness (RT) was detected from d10 p.i. onwards which peaked at d16 p.i. and decreased again to near control levels by d20 p.i. We introduce a novel semi-quantitative OCT scoring which correlates with histopathological findings and complements the clinical scores. Therefore, we conclude that OCT is an easily accessible, non-invasive tool for detection and follow-up of histopathological changes during EAU in rats. Indeed, significant differences in RT between different stages of EAU suggest that this OCT parameter is a sensitive marker for distinguishing disease phases in vivo.",14,2011-Jul-1

The human retroviruses, HTLV-I and HIV, are playing clinically important roles in a variety of ocular disorders, particularly in uveitis. Both viruses are integrated in the genome of infected T cells. HIV-I infection causes the death of the infected T cells, thereby affecting the host defence system and causing AIDS. Subsequent opportunistic infections of ocular tissues, such as CMV retinitis, are a serious problem in clinical ophthalmology all over the world. Another human retrovirus, HTLV-I, has been known as the causative agent of T cell malignancies (ATL and T cell lymphoma) and chronic myelopathy (HAM/TSP), and is now recognised as a causative agent for a specific type of intraocular inflammation characterised by vitreous opacities with mild iritis and mild retinal vasculitis (HTLV-I uveitis). The mechanism by which HTLV-I causes uveitis is still unknown, but our recent data suggest that it is most probably an immune mediated mechanism by activated CD4 T cells infected with the virus. HTLV-I uveitis, therefore, may implicate a significant role of retroviruses in autoimmune diseases and further the pathogenesis of diseases with infection/autoimmune overlap.",14,1994-Feb-1

We evaluated the efficacy of lycopene, a dietary carotenoid and potent antioxidant, against ocular inflammation and oxidative stress in an experimental uveitis model.
METHODS:: Endotoxin-induced uveitis (EIU) was induced in Sprague-Dawley rats by a single subcutaneous injection of 200 μg lipopolysaccharide (LPS). Induction of EIU was preceded by daily intraperitoneal injection of 10 mg/kg lycopene for three consecutive days (Lycopene + LPS group) or equivolume vehicle (Vehicle + LPS group). A positive control group received 1 mg/kg dexamethasone pretreatment (DEX + LPS), and a negative control group received daily vehicle injection but no LPS (Vehicle Control). Twenty-four hours after LPS or final vehicle administration, eyes were enucleated, and aqueous humor was collected for measurement of the number of infiltrating cells, total protein concentration, and levels of nitric oxide (NO), tumor necrosis factor-α (TNF-α), interleukin-6 (IL-6), and oxidative stress markers. Inflammatory response severity was compared among groups clinically and histopathologically.
RESULTS:: Infiltrating cell number, total protein concentration, and NO, TNF-α, and IL-6 levels were significantly elevated in the aqueous humor of Vehicle + LPS group rats compared to Vehicle Controls. Compared to the Vehicle + LPS group, lycopene pretreatment significantly reduced aqueous humor concentrations of oxidative stress markers, NO (0.29 ± 0.1 μM vs. 0.19 ± 0.1 μM, p=0.003), TNF-α (71.0 ± 22.3 ng/ml vs. 50.1 ± 2.1 ng/ml, p=0.043), and IL-6 (121.6 ± 3.0 pg/ml vs. 111.1 ± 5.6 pg/ml, p=0.008). Inflammatory score was also reduced (2.0 ± 0.0 vs. 0.4 ± 0.5, p=0.001). Lycopene reduced the infiltrating cell count and protein concentration, but differences did not reach significance. Most lycopene effects were equivalent to dexamethasone.
CONCLUSIONS:: Lycopene may aid in the clinical management of uveitis by suppressing inflammation and oxidative stress.",14,2016-1-1

To assess whether there is a protective association between statin use and uveitis diagnosis.
DESIGN: Retrospective, population-based case-control study.
METHODS: Medical records of all patients in the Kaiser Permanente Hawaii health plan between January 1, 2006 and December 31, 2007 (N = 217 061) were searched electronically for International Classification of Diseases, 9th Revision, diagnosis codes related to uveitis. Chart review was done to confirm incident uveitis diagnosis during the study period. Two control groups were each randomly selected at a 5:1 ratio to cases, and controls were assigned an index date to match their respective case diagnosis date. One control group was selected from the general Kaiser Permanente Hawaii population that had at least 1 healthcare visit during the study period. Another control group was selected from the population of Kaiser Permanente Hawaii members who had at least 1 visit to the ophthalmology clinic during the study period. Statin use was defined as filling a prescription for statin medication in the year prior to the diagnosis or index date based on an electronic search of the Kaiser Permanente Hawaii pharmacy database for Generic Product Identification codes. A conditional logistic regression model with clinical diagnosis of uveitis as the outcome was used to assess the relationship between statin use and uveitis.
RESULTS: One hundred eight incident cases of uveitis were identified. Nineteen percent of uveitis patients had used statin medication in the year prior to diagnosis compared to 30% of patients in the general Kaiser population control (P = .03) and 38% of patients in the ophthalmology clinic control (P < .001). Using the general Kaiser population control and adjusting for age, sex, race, and autoimmune diseases, the odds of a statin user developing uveitis were 48% less than the odds of a non-statin user developing uveitis (OR: 0.52, 95% CI: 0.29-0.94, P = .03). Similarly, the odds of developing uveitis were 33% less for statin users compared to non-statin users (OR: 0.67, 95% CI: 0.38-1.19, P = .17) when adjusting for these factors and using the ophthalmology clinic control group.
CONCLUSIONS: Statin use may be protective against the development of uveitis. Several anti-inflammatory and immunomodulatory mechanisms may explain this association.",14,2015-Apr-1

Behçet's disease (BD) is an auto-inflammatory disease, primarily characterized by recurrent painful mucocutaneous ulcerations.
METHODS: A literature search was performed to write a narrative review into the pathogenesis and current treatment options of BD.
RESULTS: The pathogenesis of BD remains to be elucidated, but is considered a genetically primed disease in which an external trigger causes immune activation resulting in inflammatory symptoms. GWAS data show an association between multiple genetic polymorphisms (HLA-B51, ERAP1, IL10 and IL23R-IL12RB2) and increased susceptibility to BD. Bacteria as streptococci, an unbalanced microbiome or molecular mimicry trigger the inflammation in BD. Increased production or responsiveness of pro-inflammatory components of the innate immune response (TLR, neutrophils, NK-cells or γδ T-cells) to these triggers may be a crucial step in the pathogenesis of BD. Additionally to an increased autoinflammatory response there is evidence of a dysregulated adaptive immune system, with a disturbed Th1/Th2 balance, expansion of Th17 cells and possibly a decrease in regulatory T cells, resulting in a surplus in pro-inflammatory cytokines. The inflammation causes a typical clinical phenotype including orogenital ulcerations, uveitis and skin lesions. Treatment is aimed at the aberrations found in the innate (neutrophils and γδ-T cells) and adaptive immune system (TNF-α, INF-γ, IL-1), directed at organ involvement and individualized based on patient characteristics.
CONCLUSION: We presented an extensive review into the pathogenesis and treatment options of BD.",14,2022-Feb-1

Clinical examination at the first visit concerning ocular symptoms showed inflammatory cells in the anterior chamber in 56%, papilledema in 87%, and serous retinal detachment and/or retinal edema in 93% of the cases. During the course of the disease, 64% of the cases showed depigmentation of the ocular fundus, and 85% showed perilimbal vitiligo (Sugiura's sign). In addition, the clinical examinations concerning extraocular symptoms showed pleocytosis in the cerebrospinal fluid in 84%, dysacousia in 74%, and scalp supersensitivity on touching the hair in 72% of the cases. Visual prognosis was generally favorable, but the final visual acuity in this disease was significantly affected by ocular complications, initial visual acuity, and the age at onset.",14,1988-1-1

In the present study we have reconfirmed an earlier observation of the association of iridocyclitis with limited joint involvement in children with JRA. Children who develop iridocyclitis are predominantly girls whose sera are positive for antinuclear antibodies. Iridocyclitis was found to be asymptomatic at onset. Only periodic slit lamp examinations will detect the majority of cases. Iridocyclitis began a median of 2 years after onset of arthritis. Although most episodes occurred within 7 years after onset of arthritis, the risk of this development may never be absent in these children, even after they enter adulthood. In the present study, 16% of the afflicted children experienced either unilateral or bilateral blindness.",14,1977-Mar-1

To evaluate the 10-year drug retention rate of infliximab (IFX) in Behçet's disease (BD)-related uveitis, the effect of a concomitant use of disease modifying anti-rheumatic drugs (DMARDs) on drug survival and differences according to the lines of biologic treatment.
METHODS: Cumulative survival rates were studied using the Kaplan-Meier plot, while the Log-rank (Mantel-Cox) test was used to compare survival curves.
RESULTS: Forty patients (70 eyes) were eligible for analysis. The drug retention rates at 12-, 24-, 60- and 120-month follow-up were 89.03%, 86.16%, 75.66% and 47.11% respectively. No differences were identified according to the use of concomitant DMARDs (p = 0.20), while a statistically significant difference was observed in relation to the different lines of IFX treatment (p = 0.014). Visual acuity improved from baseline to the last follow-up visit (p = 0.047) and a corticosteroid-sparing effect was observed (p < 0.0001).
CONCLUSIONS: IFX retention rate in BD-uveitis is excellent and is not affected by concomitant DMARDs.",14,2019-1-1

In experimental autoimmune uveitis (EAU), phagocytes are thought to be the primary cells in the initiation and maintenance of pathologic tissue damage through the release of cytotoxic agents. Recently, the presence of nitric oxide synthase has been shown in mammalian mitochondria. In this study, the effect of mitochondrial peroxynitrite on the modification of cellular proteins was evaluated in the early phase of uveitis, before the infiltration of leukocytes.
METHODS: Tyrosine nitration in proteins was detected by UV/Vis (visible) absorption and Western blot analysis. The identity of the nitrated protein was obtained by liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry. The release of cytochrome c was assessed in whole retinal extract and in isolated mitochondria. The protein nitration in the inflamed retina was also localized by immunohistochemistry.
RESULTS: Before the leukocyte infiltration in the early phase of EAU, the mitochondria-originated peroxynitrite initiated the inflammatory insult by specifically nitrating three mitochondrial proteins. In vitro nitration of the control retina by peroxynitrite donor resulted in nonspecific nitration of all major retinal proteins. After nitration, cytochrome c was displaced from its original binding site in the respiratory chain. Further, the nitration appeared to commence in the early phase of inflammation, on postimmunization day 5, long before the peak of inflammation on day 14. Immunohistochemically, tyrosine-nitrated proteins were localized exclusively in the photoreceptor inner segments, which are known to be densely populated with mitochondria.
CONCLUSIONS: These data indicate that mitochondrial proteins are the prime targets of inactivation by the mitochondrial peroxynitrite and that photoreceptor mitochondria initiate the subsequent irreversible retinal damage in experimental uveitis.",14,2005-Jul-1

We describe a case of Vogt-Koyanagi-Harada (VKH) disease exacerbation after COVID-19 vaccination. A 46-year-old woman presented with a bilateral granulomatous uveitis 2 days after the first dose of COVID-19 mRNA vaccine (Comirnaty, Pfizer-BioNTech), and was diagnosed with a complete Vogt-Koyanagi-Harada (VKH) disease 4 days after receiving the second dose of the vaccine. Three weeks before the first dose, she had been consulted for blurred vision and mild headaches. The case resolved with high dose intravenous corticosteroids, followed by oral prednisone. The close temporal relationship between the COVID-19 vaccine doses and the worsening of VKH symptoms strongly suggests COVID-19 vaccination as the trigger of its exacerbation.",13,2022-Mar-16

TNF Receptor-Associated Factor 5 (TRAF5) has been shown to be associated with autoimmune disease. The current study sought to investigate the potential association of TRAF5 with acute anterior uveitis (AAU) and pediatric uveitis in Han Chinese.
METHODS: Three TRAF5 SNPs were analyzed in 450 AAU patients with or without ankylosing spondylitis (AS), 458 pediatric uveitis patients, and 1,601 healthy controls by using polymerase chain reaction-restriction fragment length polymorphism (PCR-RFLP) or TaqMan SNP Genotyping Assay. Numerous variables were evaluated, including age, sex distribution, and clinical and laboratory observations.
RESULTS: Two SNPs (rs6540679, rs12569232) of TRAF5 were associated with pediatric uveitis, and rs12569232 also showed a relation with the presence of microvascular leakage. No significant associations were found when patients were subdivided according to their rheumatoid factor (RF) or anti-nuclear antibody (ANA) status or whether they had juvenile idiopathic arthritis (JIA). Rs12569232 predisposed to AAU and its subgroups (with ankylosing spondylitis (AS) or HLA-B27 positive). No association was found between rs10863888 and either pediatric uveitis or AAU.
CONCLUSION: This study revealed that TRAF5 is involved in the development of AAU and pediatric uveitis. Further stratified analysis according to the clinical and laboratory observations suggested that rs12569232/TRAF5 may play a role in the development of retinal vasculitis.",13,2013-1-1

The term bacillary layer detachment (BLD) represents a possible separation between the myoid and ellipsoid component of the inner segment, following insult or injury to the outer retina. It has been described previously in cases of toxoplasma retinochoroiditis, central serous chorioretinopathy, Vogt Koyanagi Harada disease and trauma.
PURPOSE: To describe the presence of BLD in Acute Posterior Multifocal Placoid Pigment Epitheliopathy (APMPPE).
METHOD: Clinical and OCT-based description of three consecutive cases of APMPPE with BLD.
RESULT: All the three cases (a 25-year-old female, a 36-year-old male, and a 32-year-old male) presented with unilateral, diminution of vision of acute onset. They were diagnosed as APMPPE and OCT revealed a splitting of the ellipsoid zone, resembling a BLD. All the three cases showed complete resolution by 1 week.
CONCLUSION: BLD appears in the acute stage of APMPPE and resolves rapidly within a week.",13,2022-Apr-03

To present the pattern, causes and complications of uveitis in one of the tertiary eye centers in Saudi Arabia.
METHODS: In this retrospective study, clinical records of randomly selected cases of uveitis attending the King Khaled Eye Specialist Hospital, Saudi Arabia, from 2001 to 2010, were reviewed.
RESULTS: Our series included 888 out of 1286 cases of uveitis. Among them, there were 390 men (43.9%) with a mean age of 39.6 ± 11 (range: 6-94 years). The prevalence of uveitis among all eye patients was 1.5% and the annual incidence was 129 cases. Uveitis was bilateral in 567 patients (63.8%), mainly anterior in 27.3%, intermediate in 12.7%, posterior in 7.1%, while 52.9% were panuveitis. Infective etiology was seen in 180 patients (20.3%), of which presumed tuberculous uveitis (PTU) was the commonest cause in 94 patients (52%), followed by herpetic in 46 (26%) and toxoplasmosis in 29 (16%). Vogt-Koyanagi-Harada (VKH) 22%, Behçet uveitis (BU) 14.6%, idiopathic anterior uveitis 12.5%, presumed tuberculous uveitis (PTU) 10.6%, and idiopathic intermediate uveitis (10.1%) accounted for the majority of cases, whereas other diagnostic entities accounted for 30%. The most common cause of anterior uveitis was idiopathic uveitis (101; 41.7%), followed by herpetic (46; 19%). Toxoplasmosis was the most frequent cause of posterior uveitis (29; 46.3%). Intermediate uveitis was most commonly idiopathic (86; 76.1%). VKH disease was the most common cause of panuveitis (195; 41.5%), followed by Behçet disease (118; 25.1%). The common complications of uveitis were glaucoma (34.1%), posterior synechiae (22.3%) and cataract (15.1%).
CONCLUSIONS: The most common anatomic diagnosis was panuveitis. VKH disease and Behçet disease were the most frequent causes and glaucoma was the most common complication of uveitis.",13,2017-Jun-1

Uveitic glaucoma (UG) typically is associated with very high intraocular pressure (IOP) and more intense optic nerve damage than other glaucoma types. This secondary glaucoma requires an early diagnosis and adequate management of both uveitis and glaucoma. It is mandatory to identify the mechanisms of IOP elevation that in many eyes have multiple combined mechanisms. Management of these patients commonly requires an interdisciplinary approach that includes a glaucoma specialist and rheumatologist to control the inflammation and IOP. Glaucoma surgery is required early in these patients due to the high IOP usually present and is less successful than in primary open-angle glaucoma. Recurrent uveitic episodes, multiple mechanism, and the complications associated with uveitis make surgical management of UG challenging. In this review, the management and treatment of UG are updated to clarify the pathogenesis and prevent optic nerve damage.",13,2015-1-1

This is the first report of a successful treatment of a non-effusive feline infectious peritonitis (FIP) uveitis case using an oral adenosine nucleoside analogue drug and feline interferon omega, and alpha-1 acid glycoprotein (AGP) as an indicator of recovery. A 2-year-old male neutered Norwegian Forest Cat presented with uveitis, keratic precipitates, mesenteric lymphadenopathy and weight loss. The cat was hypergammaglobulinaemic and had a non-regenerative anaemia. Feline coronavirus (FCoV) RNA was detected in a mesenteric lymph node fine-needle aspirate by a reverse-transcriptase polymerase chain reaction-non-effusive FIP was diagnosed. Prednisolone acetate eye drops were administered three times daily for 2 weeks. Oral adenosine nucleoside analogue (Mutian) treatment started. Within 50 days of Mutian treatment, the cat had gained over one kilogram in weight, his globulin level reduced from 77 to 51 g/L and his haematocrit increased from 22 to 35%; his uveitis resolved and his sight improved. Serum AGP level reduced from 3100 to 400 μg/mL (within normal limits). Symmetric dimethylarginine (SDMA) was above normal at 28 μg/dL, reducing to 14 μg/dL on the cessation of treatment; whether the SDMA increase was due to FIP lesions in the kidney or Mutian is unknown. Mutian treatment stopped and low-dose oral recombinant feline interferon omega begun-the cat's recovery continued.",13,2020-Oct-27

We describe an immunosuppressive peptide corresponding to the kinase inhibitory region (KIR) of the intracellular checkpoint protein suppressor of cytokine signaling 1 (SOCS-1) that binds to the phospho-tyrosine containing regions of the tyrosine kinases JAK2 and TYK2 and the adaptor protein MAL, and thereby inhibits signaling downstream from these signaling mediators. The peptide, SOCS1-KIR, is thus capable of downregulating overactive JAK/STAT or NF-kB signaling in somatic cells, including those in many compartments of the eye. Attachment of poly-arginine to this peptide (R9-SOCS1-KIR) allows it to penetrate the plasma membrane in aqueous media. R9-SOCS1-KIR was tested in ARPE-19 cells and was found to attenuate mediators of inflammation by blocking the inflammatory effects of IFNγ, TNFα, or IL-17A. R9-SOCS1-KIR and also protected against TNFα or IL-17A mediated damage to the barrier properties of ARPE-19 cells, as evidenced by immunostaining with the tight junction protein, zona occludin 1 (ZO-1), and measurement of transepithelial electrical resistance (TEER).

Early-onset sarcoidosis (EOS) and Blau syndrome are rare auto-inflammatory diseases characterized by a triad of skin rash, granulomatous uveitis, and symmetrical polyarthritis occurring in early childhood. In this paper, we describe a case report very interesting for the multidisciplinary management (pediatric rheumatologist and ophthalmologist), the challenging diagnosis and the difficult choice of the best treatment. We describe a case report of an 8-year old with recurrent episodes of acute uveitis that developed bilateral granulomatous panuveitis initially treated with topical and systemic steroids. Genetic testing for NOD2/CARD15 revealed a heterozygous mutation on exon 4 in the NBD domain (P268S/SNP5). Therefore, an incomplete EOS was suspected. Because uveitis worsening with multifocal chorioretinitis aggravation, intravenous boluses of methylprednisolone were administered. During the steroids tapering, she flared again, and methotrexate was started along with corticosteroids pulse therapy. However, new ocular granuloma appeared, macular oedema with poor visual outcome occurred, and therefore, adalimumab was added to MTX and steroids. After 6 months since the new therapy started, she had a complete visual recovery, and she was able to stop steroid treatment. At 2 years of follow-up, she is still in remission on treatment, and her visual acuity is normal. No side effects were observed. In our patient, we found a heterozygous mutation on exon 4 in the NBD domain (P268S/SNP5) of NOD2/CARD15 gene and an incomplete EOS was hypothesized. The role of this variant is currently under study. Adalimumab use dramatically changed the course of eye disease, prompting to stop steroid treatment and preserving visual acuity.",13,2016-Feb-1

Uveitis is a sight threatening inflammatory disorder that affects all ages and remains a significant cause of visual loss. Animal models of autoimmune and inflammatory disease in the eye allow the scientist and clinician to study the basic mechanism of the disease, and serve as templates for the development of therapeutic approaches. The accumulating knowledge of the various steps that are involved in the pathogenesis make it possible to devise specific strategies that disrupt discrete stages in the process. Some of the strategies are in the process of being translated to the clinic. New technologies emerge, promising more specific and more easily applied therapies.

Uveitis, which is a major cause of blindness worldwide, is defined as intraocular inflammation that affects the iris, ciliary body, vitreous, retina and choroid. Tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-α) is a key cytokine involved in the pathogenesis of many inflammatory diseases including uveitis. Corticosteroids and immunosuppressive agents are the conventional therapy to treat non-infectious uveitis. In cases that are resistant to these therapies, anti-TNF agents are added. An anti-TNF-α agent, adalimumab, was recently approved for the treatment of refractory non-infectious uveitis. In this review, we provide an introduction to uveitis and summarize the effectiveness and safety of adalimumab in the treatment of non-infectious uveitis.",13,2019-Jun-1

We sought to describe the risk and risk factors for hypotony in a noninfectious uveitis cohort.
DESIGN: Retrospective cohort study.
PARTICIPANTS: Patients with noninfectious uveitis seen between 1979 and 2007 at 4 academic ocular inflammation specialty clinics.
METHODS: Data were collected from medical records by trained, certified, expert reviewers.
MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Hypotony (<5 mmHg) and low intraocular pressure (<8 mmHg), each sustained for ≥ 2 visits spanning ≥ 30 days.
RESULTS: During follow-up, 126 of 6785 patients (1.86%) developed hypotony at the rate of 0.61% (95% confidence interval [CI], 0.50-0.75%) per eye-year. Cataract surgery was associated with a 7.5-fold risk (adjusted hazard ratio [aHR], 7.51; 95% CI, 3.97-14.23) of incident hypotony. Phacoemulsification, the type of cataract surgery associated with the least hypotony risk still was associated with nearly 5-fold higher hypotony incidence (aHR, 4.87; 95% CI, 2.25-10.55). Increased risk was observed in children (aHR, 2.92; 95% CI, 1.20-7.10) with respect to young adults, and duration of uveitis of >5 years (aHR, 3.08; 95% CI, 1.30-7.31) with respect to uveitis of <6 month duration. Band keratopathy, ≥ 3+ vitreous cells, exudative retinal detachment, posterior synechia, and a history of pars plana vitrectomy also were associated with greater hypotony incidence. With respect to anterior uveitis, intermediate uveitis (aHR, 0.17; 95% CI, 0.05-0.56) and posterior uveitis (aHR, 0.11; 95% CI, 0.03-0.45) were associated with lower hypotony risk, whereas panuveitis (aHR, 1.25; 95% CI, 0.67-2.35) was similar. Approximately five-sixths (84.1%) of eyes presenting with hypotony had a visual acuity of ≤ 20/200 (aOR for visual acuity ≤ 20/200, 13.85; 95% CI, 7.23-26.53). Risk factors for prevalent hypotony were similar.
CONCLUSIONS: The risk of hypotony is low among eyes with noninfectious uveitis, but is more frequently observed in cases with anterior segment inflammation. Signs of present or past inflammation were associated with greater risk, suggesting excellent inflammatory control may reduce the risk of hypotony. Prior ocular surgery also was associated with higher risk; cataract surgery in particular was associated with much higher risk of hypotony. Lower risk of hypotony with phacoemulsification than with alternative cataract surgery approaches suggests the phacoemulsification approach is preferable.",13,2012-Nov-1

To study the applicability (sensitivity, specificity) of polymerase chain reaction (PCR) tests in the detection of cytomegalovirus (CMV), herpes virus (HSV) and varicella zoster (VZV), Epstein-Barr virus (EBV), Mycobacterium sp and Toxoplasma gondii in the diagnosis of patients with or without AIDS, with presumably infectious uveitis, using serum, aqueous humor and vitreous humor samples.
METHODS: Twenty individuals with uveitis of presumed infectious origin were evaluated. Sixteen of them had AIDS, four were immunocompetent individuals. We also evaluated 4 normal controls who underwent vitrectomy surgery. Clinical evaluation of the patients was performed together by three clinicians. PCR evaluations of the serum, aqueous, and vitreous humor were performed in a masked fashion by the laboratory staff.
RESULTS: Twelve patients had a clinical diagnosis of CMV retinitis. Of these 6 (50%) had a positive PCR for CMV in the vitreous, three (25%) had a positive PCR for CMV in the serum, and none were positive in the aqueous. Five patients had a clinical diagnosis of acute retinal necrosis (ARN). Three (60%) of these had positive PCR for HSV/VZV in the vitreous. One of these patients had a positive PCR reaction for both EBV and HSV/VZV in the vitreous samples. One patient with cutaneous herpes zoster had a positive PCR reaction for HSV/VZV in the serum. Four patients had a presumed diagnosis of ocular toxoplasmosis, one patient (25%) had a positive PCR for Toxoplasma gondii in the serum, 3 (75%) had positive results in the aqueous, and 2 (50%) had positive results in the vitreous. One patient with presumed ocular tuberculosis had a positive PCR reaction both in the serum and in the vitreous samples. Finally, none of the four control individuals revealed any positive PCR reaction.
CONCLUSION: PCR is an auxiliary diagnostic procedure that should be evaluated together with ophthalmological aspects of the patient.",13,2007-1-1

Non-infectious uveitis (NIU) is the first cause of blindness that can be cured if optimal anti-inflammatory therapy can be achieved. Systemic anti-TNF (Tumor Necrosis Factor) agents have been recently approved for NIU but no local delivery of anti-TNF is available. For sustained production of secreted therapeutic proteins into the eye, non-viral gene therapy using plasmid electrotransfer in the ciliary muscle has been proposed. In this paper, we report the development steps of pEYS606, a clinical-grade plasmid DNA, devoid of antiobiotic selection gene, encoding a fusion protein consisting of the extracellular domain of the soluble p55 TNF-α receptor linked to the human IgG1 Fc domain (hTNFR-Is/hIgG1 or Protein 6), with high affinity for human TNF-α, for non-viral gene transfer into the ocular ciliary muscle. Electrotransfer of pEYS606 in the ciliary muscle significantly reduced ocular inflammation in two well-established rat models of uveitis, the endotoxin-induced uveitis (EIU) and the experimental autoimmune uveitis (EAU). In addition, in EAU, a significant protection of photoreceptors was demonstrated after pEYS606 treatment. The improved pharmacokinetic profile of intraocularly-secreted protein as compared to direct intravitreous injection of recombinant protein allowed to demonstrate Protein 6 efficacy at very low concentrations. Based on these results, a phase I/II clinical trial is conducted [ClinicalTrials.gov Identifier: NCT03308045].",13,2018-Sep-10

Birdshot retinochoroiditis (BRC) is a relatively recently described entity. BRC uveitis is predominant in the posterior segment with dual, independent retinal, and choroidal inflammation. The disease has no known extra-ocular inflammation sites and yet features the strongest known HLA association: HLA-A29 is present in close to 100 % of cases. Aim in this mini-review was to readjust the appraisal of BRC in the light of a global approach including the full array of investigational procedures. Historical background and the genesis of the disease name were searched. Global disease description including both the retina and the choroid was given. Retinal involvement was clearly characterized, pointing toward the profuse leakage of retinal vessels of all sizes in early disease and widespread atrophy in under treated patients. The importance of exploration of choroidal disease, unavailable until the early 1990s before the advent of indocyanine green angiography (ICGA) was stressed, allowing early diagnosis of disease. Despite its proven importance to explore the choroid, ICGA is still sparsely used. Existing diagnostic criteria were found to be clearly inappropriate not allowing early diagnosis and are in need to be revised, taking into account both retinal and choroidal aspects of the disease, in order to make early diagnosis possible and hence allow proper management .",13,2015-Apr-1

To assess the efficacy of golimumab (GLM), a fully humanised anti-TNF-α monoclonal antibody, in refractory juvenile idiopathic arthritis (JIA)-associated uveitis.
METHODS: This was a multicentre study of JIA-associated uveitis refractory to standard synthetic immunosuppressive drugs and in most cases to other anti-TNF-α agents. Results were expressed as mean±standard deviation or as median (range or interquartile range). The Wilcoxon signed-rank test was used to compare continuous variables. A literature review of the efficacy of GLM in uveitis related to JIA was also conducted.
RESULTS: We studied 7 patients (5 females; mean age 21.7±7.5 years; 13 affected eyes). Uveitis was bilateral in 6. Cystoid macular oedema (CME) occurred in 3 patients (5 eyes). Besides corticosteroids and synthetic immunosuppressive drugs, patients had received before GLM a median of 2 biologic agents (range 0-3) including adalimumab (n=6), etanercept (n=2), infliximab (n=3) and abatacept (n=2). GLM dose was 50 mg/sc every 4 weeks. After 6 months of therapy the number of anterior chamber cells decreased from 1 [0.25-1.5] to 0 [0-0.5] (p=0.02) and optical coherence tomography (in patients with CME) from 313.6±77.05 to 261.4±75.1 μm (p=0.03). The best-corrected visual acuity increased from 0.5 to 0.62 (p=0.018). Complete remission of uveitis was achieved in 4 of 7 patients after 16.8±11.4 months of follow-up. However, 2 of the seven patients had to be switched to tocilizumab due to inefficacy. Local erythema at the injection site was observed in 2.
CONCLUSIONS: GLM may be considered in the management of refractory JIA-related uveitis.",13,2018-1-1

To investigate the causes and clinical characteristics of uveitis in patients presenting to a specialized eye hospital in Turkey.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: The clinical records of 1028 uveitis patients admitted between 1990 and 2010 were retrospectively reviewed. Age at first presentation, sex, laterality, etiology, associated systemic disease, clinical presentation, and course of the disease were noted.
RESULTS: The mean age at presentation was 36.23 ± 14.9 years. Males constituted 58.2% of patients. Anatomically, anterior uveitis (42%) was most common, followed by posterior uveitis (24.9%), panuveitis (24.7%), and intermediate uveitis (8.4%). The course of the disease was mostly chronic (65.7%). The cases were idiopathic at 25.7% and Behçet's disease (BD) was the most common cause of uveitis (32.2%), followed by ocular toxoplasmosis (7.2%) and herpetic uveitis (6.8%).
CONCLUSION: Uveitis tends to affect patients between 20 and 40 years old. BD is the most common cause, leading to male predominance and a higher frequency of a chronic course.",13,2014-1-1

To describe the pattern of uveitis among Chinese, Malays, and Indians at a tertiary referral institution in Singapore.
METHODS: Charts between January 1997 and December 2010 were retrospectively reviewed. Charts between January 2014 and December 2014 were prospectively reviewed.
RESULTS: A total of 1249 and 148 charts were retrospectively and prospectively reviewed, respectively. The top causes of anterior uveitis (AU) were HLA-B27, idiopathic, and CMV AU. The top known causes of intermediate uveitis were tuberculosis, primary intraocular lymphoma, and sarcoidosis. The top causes of posterior uveitis were CMV retinitis, toxoplasmosis, and dengue maculopathy. The top causes of panuveitis were VKH, idiopathic panuveitis, tuberculosis, and Behçet disease. HLA-B27 and CMV AU were more frequent among Chinese (21% vs 9% (non-Chinese); p<0.001; 10% vs 5% (non-Chinese); p<0.001, respectively). Tuberculous uveitis was more frequent among Malays and Indians (12% (non-Chinese) vs 5% (Chinese), p<0.001).

The conventional treatment of uveitis includes corticosteroids and immunosuppressive agents, which are highly efficacious, but can be associated with serious systemic side effects. Over the last two decades, advances in the understanding of the pathogenesis of inflammatory diseases, as well as improved biotechnology, have enabled selective targeting of the chemical mediators of diseases. Recently, a new class of drugs called biologics, that target the various mediators of the inflammation cascade, may potentially provide more effective and less toxic treatment.
AREAS COVERED: This article is a review and summary of the peer-reviewed evidence for biologic agents in the treatment of various forms of ocular inflammation and it focuses on the potential use of other biologic agents that have been tested in experimental autoimmune uveitis. Pubmed was used as our main tool for our literature search. Some additional references were taken from books written on the subject.
EXPERT OPINION: There are a wide variety of new and emerging biological agents currently being used in the treatment of uveitis which has expanded the therapeutic horizons far beyond previous limitations.",13,2012-Mar-1

Five patients had bilateral anterior uveitis associated with renal disease. Interstitial nephritis was histologically confirmed in three cases. Fatigue, anorexia, abdominal pain, weight loss, and anemia were common systemic complaints or findings. In each case, the uveitis was anterior, eventually bilateral, and associated with minimal visual impairment. Complications of the uveitis included increased intraocular pressure, synechiae, keratic precipitates, macular edema, and intraretinal hemorrhage as well as cells in the anterior vitreous humor and an exudate over the pars plana. Sjögren's syndrome, systemic lupus erythematosus, sarcoid, and syphilis were excluded as diagnoses that could explain the association of renal and uveal disease.",13,1988-May-15

The goal of this review is to describe the more commonly used imaging techniques and their use to identify causes of vision loss, extent of disease, and distinctive patterns associated with various causes of posterior uveitis.
RECENT FINDINGS: Distinctive patterns seen with new imaging techniques and applications are being described. Ophthalmic CT, fluorescein angiography, indocyanine green angiography, and others are demonstrating inflammation and pathology in posterior uveitis. As our experience grows with these modalities, they are being used increasingly in the diagnosis and management of patients with posterior uveitis.
SUMMARY: This review familiarizes the ophthalmologist with imaging in patients with inflammatory disorders of the retina and choroid. These modalities can help with the diagnosis, treatment, and monitoring of patients with uveitis.",13,2004-Dec-1

Autoimmune uveitis is one of the leading causes of blindness. We here investigated whether intraperitoneal administration of human mesenchymal stem/stromal cells (hMSCs) might prevent development of experimental autoimmune uveitis (EAU) in mice. Time course study showed that the number of IFN-γ- or IL-17-expressing CD4(+) T cells was increased in draining lymph nodes (DLNs) on the postimmunization day 7 and decreased thereafter. The retinal structure was severely disrupted on day 21. An intraperitoneal injection of hMSCs at the time of immunization protected the retina from damage and suppressed the levels of proinflammatory cytokines in the eye. Analysis of DLNs on day 7 showed that hMSCs decreased the number of Th1 and Th17 cells. The hMSCs did not reduce the levels of IL-1β, IL-6, IL-12, and IL-23 which are the cytokines that drive Th1/Th17 differentiation. Also, hMSCs did not induce CD4(+)CD25(+)Foxp3(+) cells. However, hMSCs increased the level of an immunoregulatory cytokine IL-10 and the population of IL-10-expressing B220(+)CD19(+) cells. Together, data demonstrate that hMSCs attenuate EAU by suppressing Th1/Th17 cells and induce IL-10-expressing B220(+)CD19(+) cells. Our results support suggestions that hMSCs may offer a therapy for autoimmune diseases mediated by Th1/Th17 responses.",13,2014-1-1

The complement system is a vital component of the immune-priveliged human eye that is always active at a low-grade level, preventing harmful intraocular injuries caused by accumulation of turnover products and controlling pathogens to preserve eye homeostasis and vision. The complement system is a double-edged sword that is essential for protection but may also become harmful and contribute to eye pathology. Here, we review the evidence for the involvement of complement system dysregulation in age-related macular degeneration, glaucoma, uveitis, and neuromyelitis optica, highlighting the relationship between morphogical changes and complement system protein expression and regulation in these diseases. The potential benefits of complement inhibition in age-related macular degeneration, glaucoma, uveitis, and neuromyelitis optica are abundant, as are those of further research to improve our understanding of complement-mediated injury in these diseases.",13,2017-Sep-1

Uveitis is caused by disorders of diverse etiologies including wide spectrum of infectious and non-infectious causes. Often clinical signs are less specific and shared by different diseases. On several occasions, uveitis represents diseases that are developing elsewhere in the body and ocular signs may be the first evidence of such systemic diseases. Uveitis specialists need to have a thorough knowledge of all entities and their work up has to be systematic and complete including systemic and ocular examinations. Creating an algorithmic approach on critical steps to be taken would help the ophthalmologist in arriving at the etiological diagnosis.",13,2013-Jun-1

Management of uveitic cataract in patients with juvenile idiopathic arthritis (JIA) is challenging, and intraocular lens (IOL) implantation is controversial. This study investigated the outcome after minimally invasive surgery with IOL implantation.
METHODS: Retrospective analysis after phacoemulsification with in-the-bag IOL implantation was performed in 16 patients (17 operations) with ANA-positive JIA-associated chronic uveitis. In these patients, 25 G capsulectomy and anterior vitrectomy was performed and they received an intravitreal triamcinolone (TA) injection.
RESULTS:   Mean age at uveitis onset was 5 ± 2 years, and surgery was performed at a mean age of 11 ± 2.2 years. Preoperatively, uveitis was inactive in all patients, and visual acuity was logMAR 0.8 ± 0.44; additional uveitis complications were present in all patients, and 15 patients were receiving systemic immunosuppression/biologicals. After surgery (mean follow-up 26.5 ± 11.7 months), presence of cystoid macular oedema, papilloedema, ocular hypertension/glaucoma and hypotony did not increase compared with baseline. There was no significant worsening of AC inflammation (by cell numbers and laser flare values). IOL deposits persisted in four patients, and synechiae developed in eight. The visual acuity was improved (≥2 lines) in all patients (mean logMAR 0.3 ± 0.24). Retrolental membrane formation was not noted. Secondary capsular opacification was observed in seven patients, requiring Nd:YAG capsulotomy in five of them.
CONCLUSIONS: Phacoemulsification and in-the-bag IOL implantation may improve visual outcome in JIA-associated uveitis with minimally invasive surgical technique and intravitreal TA injection. Well-controlled uveitis with appropriate use of topical steroids and systemic immunosuppression or biologicals appears as a perioperative requirement.",13,2012-Nov-1

To describe the risk and risk factors for ocular hypertension (OHT) in adults with noninfectious uveitis.
DESIGN: Retrospective, multicenter, cohort study.
PARTICIPANTS: Patients aged ≥18 years with noninfectious uveitis seen between 1979 and 2007 at 5 tertiary uveitis clinics.
METHODS: Demographic, ocular, and treatment data were extracted from medical records of uveitis cases.
MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Prevalent and incident OHT with intraocular pressures (IOPs) of ≥21 mmHg, ≥30 mmHg, and increase of ≥10 mmHg from documented IOP recordings (or use of treatment for OHT).
RESULTS: Among 5270 uveitic eyes of 3308 patients followed for OHT, the mean annual incidence rates for OHT ≥21 mmHg and OHT ≥30 mmHg are 14.4% (95% confidence interval [CI], 13.4-15.5) and 5.1% (95% CI, 4.7-5.6) per year, respectively. Statistically significant risk factors for incident OHT ≥30 mmHg included systemic hypertension (adjusted hazard ratio [aHR], 1.29); worse presenting visual acuity (≤20/200 vs. ≥20/40, aHR, 1.47); pars plana vitrectomy (aHR, 1.87); history of OHT in the other eye: IOP ≥21 mmHg (aHR, 2.68), ≥30 mmHg (aHR, 4.86) and prior/current use of IOP-lowering drops or surgery in the other eye (aHR, 4.17); anterior chamber cells: 1+ (aHR, 1.43) and ≥2+ (aHR, 1.59) vs. none; epiretinal membrane (aHR, 1.25); peripheral anterior synechiae (aHR, 1.81); current use of prednisone >7.5 mg/day (aHR, 1.86); periocular corticosteroids in the last 3 months (aHR, 2.23); current topical corticosteroid use [≥8×/day vs. none] (aHR, 2.58); and prior use of fluocinolone acetonide implants (aHR, 9.75). Bilateral uveitis (aHR, 0.69) and previous hypotony (aHR, 0.43) were associated with statistically significantly lower risk of OHT.
CONCLUSIONS: Ocular hypertension is sufficiently common in eyes treated for uveitis that surveillance for OHT is essential at all visits for all cases. Patients with 1 or more of the several risk factors identified are at particularly high risk and must be carefully managed. Modifiable risk factors, such as use of corticosteroids, suggest opportunities to reduce OHT risk within the constraints of the overriding need to control the primary ocular inflammatory disease.",13,2017-Aug-1

The aim of this study is to characterise the choroidal features of patients diagnosed with sarcoid- and tuberculosis (TB)-associated granulomatous uveitis using spectral domain optical coherence tomography (OCT).
METHODS: Twenty-seven patients (27 eyes) diagnosed with sarcoid- (13 eyes) and TB (14 eyes)-related uveitis were included in this retrospective, cross-sectional study. Over a six-month period, patients diagnosed with sarcoid and TB granulomatous uveitis were scanned using enhanced depth imaging OCT. Clinical and demographical characteristics were recorded, including the method of diagnosis, disease activity, site of inflammation (anterior or posterior), treatments, and visual acuity (VA). Manual segmentation of the choroidal layers was performed using custom image analysis software.
RESULTS: The main outcome measure was OCT-derived thickness measurements of the choroid and choroidal sublayers (Haller's large vessel and Sattler's medium vessel layers) at the macula region. The ratio of Haller's large vessel to Sattler's medium vessel layer was significantly different at the total macula circle in eyes diagnosed with TB uveitis (1.47 (=140.71/95.72 μm)) compared with sarcoid uveitis (1.07 (=137.70/128.69 μm)) (P=0.001). A thinner choroid was observed in eyes with a VA ≥0.3 LogMAR (Snellen 6/12; 198.1 μm (interquartile range (IQR)=147.0-253.4 μm) compared with those with VA <0.3 LogMAR (292.4 μm (IQR=240.1-347.6 μm)) at the total macula circle (P=0.004). At the foveal central subfield, the median choroidal thickness was 336.8 μm (IQR=272.3-375.4 μm) in active compared with 239.3 μm (IQR=195.3-330.9 μm) in quiescent disease (P=0.04).
CONCLUSION: A disproportionately enlarged Sattler's layer may indicate a diagnosis of sarcoid-related uveitis, and choroidal thickening may be a feature of active granulomatous uveitis.",13,2015-Aug-1

Juvenile idiopathic arthritis (JIA) is the most common pediatric rheumatic disease and the most common systemic disorder associated with uveitis in childhood. Uveitis is more common in JIA patients who are antinuclear antibody (ANA)-positive, have an early-onset disease, and have oligoarticular arthritis. JIA-associated uveitis (JIA-uveitis) is typically anterior, chronic, bilateral, nongranulomatous, and asymptomatic. Visual outcomes in JIA-uveitis have improved with current screening and treatment options; however, many patients fail to respond or do not achieve long-lasting remission. Baricitinib, an oral selective Janus kinase (JAK)1 and 2 inhibitor, may impact key cytokines implicated in the pathogenesis of JIA-uveitis or ANA-positive uveitis, representing a potential novel treatment option for disease management.
METHODS: The multicenter, phase 3 trial will be conducted using an open-label Bayesian design. The study will enroll at least 20 and up to 40 patients aged 2 to <18 years with active JIA-uveitis or chronic ANA-positive uveitis without systemic features. At least 20 patients who have had an inadequate response or intolerance to methotrexate (MTX-IR), but not biologic disease-modifying antirheumatic drugs (bDMARDs), will be randomized (1:1) to open-label baricitinib or adalimumab. Approximately 20 additional patients who are MTX-IR or bDMARD inadequate responders will receive baricitinib treatment. Patients will be treated with once daily oral baricitinib at a fixed dose by age group (4 mg for patients aged ≥6 to <18 years and 2 mg for patients <6 years) or adalimumab (20 mg for patients weighing <30 kg and 40 mg for patients ≥30 kg) as a subcutaneous injection every 2 weeks. Treatment with stable background conventional synthetic DMARDs, low-dose corticosteroids, and/or nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs is allowed. The primary endpoint is the proportion of patients with response at week 24. Patients may continue treatment for up to 5 years.
DISCUSSION: This is the first pediatric clinical trial to assess the clinical effectiveness and safety of a JAK inhibitor in JIA-uveitis or chronic ANA-positive uveitis. A novel Bayesian design is used to assess the efficacy of baricitinib, including an adalimumab reference arm, in this small patient population with unmet medical need.

Equine recurrent uveitis (ERU) is an immune-mediated disease causing repeated or persistent inflammatory episodes which can lead to blindness. Currently, there is no cure for horses with this disease. Mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) are effective at reducing immune cell activation in vitro in many species, making them a potential therapeutic option for ERU. The objectives of this study were to define the lymphocyte phenotype of horses with ERU and to determine how MSCs alter T-cell phenotype in vitro. Whole blood was taken from 7 horses with ERU and 10 healthy horses and peripheral blood mononuclear cells were isolated. The markers CD21, CD3, CD4, and CD8 were used to identify lymphocyte subsets while CD25, CD62L, Foxp3, IFNγ, and IL10 were used to identify T-cell phenotype. Adipose-derived MSCs were expanded, irradiated (to control proliferation), and incubated with CD4",13,2020-Jan-1

To assess the long-term efficacy of the most widely used anti-tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNFα) agents for treatment of HLA-B27-positive ankylosing spondylitis (AS)-related uveitis.
DESIGN: Retrospective cohort study.
METHODS: The medical records of 143 patients with HLA-B27-positive AS who visited Seoul St. Mary's Hospital and were taking an anti-TNFα agent for at least 1 year were studied. Subjects were divided into 3 groups according to anti-TNFα treatment: Group 1 (infliximab, 66), Group 2 (adalimumab, 45), and Group 3 (etanercept, 32).
RESULTS: Mean age was 41.0 ± 13.0 years, and 97 patients (67.8%) were male. Mean follow-up period was 70.6 ± 37.9 months. In cases of active ocular inflammation at the onset of anti-TNFα treatment, patients showed improved activity of uveitis after 24.0 ± 15.0 days (Group 1), 17.9 ± 6.0 days (Group 2), and 25.9 ± 18.0 days (Group 3). After the anti-TNFα treatment, 71 of 94 patients (32 [76.2%] in Group 1, 26 [78.8%] in Group 2, and 13 [68.4%] in Group 3) remained without uveitis relapse. A reduction in the number of systemic medications was achieved in 129 patients (90.2%). Twenty-eight cases of minor side effects were observed, and 4 cases were tuberculosis leading to discontinuation of anti-TNFα treatment.
CONCLUSIONS: Infliximab, adalimumab, and etanercept were effective for treating and reducing the number of uveitis relapses in HLA-B27-positive AS. However, the risk of serious infections was noted, so ophthalmologists should consider the possibility that prolonged use of biologic agents may result in systemic side effects.",13,2016-Oct-1

Non-infectious non-anterior uveitis (NINA) is a sight-threatening condition that often requires immunomodulatory drugs (IMDs) for its management.
OBJECTIVES: To evaluate the published evidence regarding the use of IMDs in adult patients with NINA uveitis including intermediate (IU) and posterior uveitis (PU), panuveitis (PanU) and macular edema (ME).
METHODS: We performed a systematic literature review. Search strategies were designed for Medline, Embase, and Cochrane Libraries for articles up to 2019 to evaluate the efficacy and safety of the IMDs. A quality assessment was performed using the Jadad Scale.
RESULTS: Nineteen randomized clinical trials were selected from the 1,103 articles retrieved. Characteristics of patients, treatment dosages and outcome measures were heterogeneous. The outcomes most frequently analyzed were visual acuity (VA), macular thickness and vitreous haze (VH). Different IMDs were used at their usual dosages. Methotrexate (MTX), micophenolate mofetil, cyclosporine A (CsA), tacrolimus, adalimumab and sarilumab were effective in NINA uveitis. Rituximab combined with MTX was effective in PU. Interferon-β was superior to MTX, albeit with more adverse events in IU with ME. CsA was similar to cyclophosphamide (Cyc) in Behçet uveitis. Tacrolimus was safer and similar to CsA. Cyc was effective in serpiginoid choroiditis, but when combined with azathioprine in PU, but did not improve VA. Secukinumab did not prevent NINA uveitis recurrences, although intravenously it showed a higher response rate than when used subcutaneously. Daclizumab did not show any benefits in Behçet NINA uveitis.
CONCLUSION: Several IMDs and their combinations can be useful in treating NINA uveitis. The available studies were heterogeneous regarding patient characteristics and outcomes.",13,2020-Dec-1

To review the etiologic factors and complications of uveitis in patients younger than 16 years.
PATIENTS AND METHODS: Between January 1989 and December 1999 in the Department of Ophthalmology of Hacettepe University School of Medicine, 219 patients were diagnosed or observed as having pediatric uveitis. After complete ocular and physical examinations, routine and specific laboratory and radiologic investigations were performed. Medical or surgical treatment was employed when necessary.
RESULTS: Of the 219 patients, 112 were girls, with a mean age of 7.4 +/- 4.2 years, and 107 were boys, with a mean age of 8.3 +/- 3.4 years. In 24.2% of the cases, no etiologic factor could be ascertained; these cases comprised the idiopathic group. Among the remaining cases, the most common etiologies were toxoplasmosis, juvenile rheumatoid arthritis (JRA), pars planitis, Behçet's disease, and Fuchs' heterochromic iridocyclitis. Anatomically, anterior uveitis was the most common form. The mean follow-up time was 37 +/- 6.2 months. Complications for which surgical treatment was employed were identified in 71 eyes (20.9%), most of which were due to JRA, pars planitis, or Behçet's disease.
CONCLUSION: Uveitis in childhood may be idiopathic or most commonly due to toxoplasmosis, JRA, and pars planitis. Due to inflammation itself or to prolonged therapy especially with corticosteroids, pediatric uveitis entities (mostly JRA, pars planitis, or Behçet's disease) may result in complications necessitating a surgical approach.",13,2003-1-1

Recurrent uveitis, a leading cause of blindness in horses, often develops as a sequela to systemic leptospirosis. Over a 7-year period, 63 of 112 (56%) horses with uveitis were seropositive for Leptospira interrogans serovar pomona, but only 23 of 260 (9%) horses without uveitis were seropositive. Odds-ratio analysis revealed that seropositive horses were 13.2 times more likely to have uveitis than were seronegative horses. Of the 63 seropositive horses with uveitis, 59% developed blindness, compared with only 24% in the 49 seronegative horses with uveitis that lost vision in 1 or both eyes during the same period. Odds-ratio analysis revealed that seropositive horses with uveitis were 4.4 times more likely to lose vision than were seronegative horses with uveitis. Of the 112 horses with uveitis, 28 (25%) were Appaloosas, compared with only 10 of the 260 (4%) horses without uveitis (odds ratio, 8.3). In addition, 19 of the 28 (68%) Appaloosas with uveitis developed blindness, compared with only 30 of the 84 (36%) non-Appaloosas with uveitis that lost vision in 1 or both eyes (odds ratio, 3.8). This field study therefore confirmed a strong positive relationship between uveitis and leptospiral seroreactivity in horses. Furthermore, the data suggested that seropositive horses with uveitis were at increased risk of losing vision, compared with that in seronegative horses with uveitis, and that Appaloosas were at increased risk of developing uveitis and associated blindness, compared with that in non-Appaloosas.",13,1995-Nov-15

Serum samples from 91 uveitis patients and controls were tested by the enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay technique to determine their relative antibody titers to bovine retinal S antigen and to a detergent extract of saline-washed bovine retina, or P antigen. Only those patients whose uveitis fell into the categories of toxoplasmosis, iritis, herpes keratouveitis, pars planitis, sarcoidosis. Behçet's syndrome, and Vogt-Koyamagi-Harada syndrome are presented in this study. Significantly elevated titers (P less than 0.05) of antibody to S antigen were found in the diagnostic categories of iritis, toxoplasmosis, sarcoidosis, and Behçet's. Elevated titers to the detergent extract were found in iritis (granulomatous and hypopyon subcategories only), toxoplasmosis, sarcoidosis, and Vogt-Koyanagi-Harada syndrome. The anti-S titers of patients treated with systemic steroids were depressed below normal levels. A separate control group of patients with nonuveal ocular inflammations (conjunctivitis, episcleritis, etc.) had titers very similar to normal controls. The posttreatment titers to S antigen of patients receiving laser photocoagulation for diabetic retinopathy were significantly elevated over normal controls.",13,1981-Nov-1

Equine recurrent uveitis (ERU) is a common eye disease affecting up to 3-15% of the horse population. A genome-wide association study (GWAS) using the Illumina equine SNP50 bead chip was performed to identify loci conferring risk to ERU. The sample included a total of 144 German warmblood horses. A GWAS showed a significant single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) on horse chromosome (ECA) 20 at 49.3 Mb, with IL-17A and IL-17F being the closest genes. This locus explained a fraction of 23% of the phenotypic variance for ERU. A GWAS taking into account the severity of ERU, revealed a SNP on ECA18 nearby to the crystalline gene cluster CRYGA-CRYGF. For both genomic regions on ECA18 and 20, significantly associated haplotypes containing the genome-wide significant SNPs could be demonstrated. In conclusion, our results are indicative for a genetic component regulating the possible critical role of IL-17A and IL-17F in the pathogenesis of ERU. The associated SNP on ECA18 may be indicative for cataract formation in the course of ERU.",13,2013-1-1

Infection by Leptospira interrogans has been causally associated with human and equine uveitis. Studies in our laboratories have demonstrated that leptospiral lipoprotein LruA and LruB are expressed in the eyes of uveitic horses, and that antibodies directed against LruA and LruB react with equine lenticular and retinal extracts, respectively. These reactivities were investigated further by performing immunofluorescent assays on lenticular and retinal tissue sections. Incubation of lens tissue sections with LruA-antiserum and retinal sections with LruB-antiserum resulted in positive fluorescence. By employing two-dimensional gel analyses followed by immunoblotting and mass spectrometry, lens proteins cross-reacting with LruA antiserum were identified to be alpha-crystallin B and vimentin. Similarly, mass spectrometric analyses identified beta-crystallin B2 as the retinal protein cross-reacting with LruB-antiserum. Purified recombinant human alpha-crystallin B and vimentin were recognized by LruA-directed antiserum, but not by control pre-immune serum. Recombinant beta-crystallin B2 was likewise recognized by LruB-directed antiserum, but not by pre-immune serum. Moreover, uveitic eye fluids contained significantly higher levels of antiibodies that recognized alpha-crystallin B, beta-crystallin B2 and vimentin than did normal eye fluids. Our results indicate that LruA and LruB share immuno-relevant epitopes with eye proteins, suggesting that cross-reactive antibody interactions with eye antigens may contribute to immunopathogenesis of Leptospira-associated recurrent uveitis.",13,2010-Aug-03

Among 21 patients with Behçet's disease, the results of various treatments were assessed. Treatment with chlorambucil, 0.1 mg/kg daily, compared favorably with corticosteroids. Uveitis and visual acuities improved in five of seven eyes when the patients were treated with chlorambucil, whereas improvement was observed in only four of 13 eyes when treatment consisted of corticosteroids. In 19 treatment courses among 14 patients with meningoencephalitis or recurrent meningitis, eight of nine patients treated with chlorambucil had remission of their disease; eight of 10 treatment courses with other agents--generally, corticosteroids--failed to induce remission in any of eight patients. Elevated cerebrospinal fluid cell counts returned to normal in five of nine patients treated with chlorambucil but remained elevated in five of six patients treated with corticosteroids. Two patients died, one who was taking prednisone plus cyclophosphamide and the other after prednisone plus multiple immunosuppressive treatments. Toxicity from chlorambucil included leukopenia (two patients), thrombocytopenia (one), bronchopneumonia (one), and amenorrhea (two). The duration of chlorambucil therapy averaged 1.8 years both for patients with uveitis and for those with meningoencephalitis.",13,1984-Jan-1

The clinical features of idiopathic uveitis were compared by the seropositivity for human T-cell lymphotropic virus type I. The statistical analysis of various clinical variables disclosed that the uveitis seen in seropositive patients (93 patients) had a significantly higher incidence of floaters, vitreous opacities, retinal vasculitis, and intermediate uveitis than that in seronegative patients (222 patients) (P < .05). The odds ratios of the virus infection for these clinical manifestations were high and statistically significant, suggesting that the virus infection has a role as a risk factor for the development of these clinical manifestations. Although visual acuity at the initial examination was almost equal between the two groups, after the therapy with topical or systemic corticosteroids, or both, visual acuity in seropositive patients was much better than that in seronegative patients. The surface phenotype of peripheral lymphocytes in the two groups was compared as follows: CD4-positive T lymphocytes (P < .05), CD4/8 ratio (P < .01), and CD25-positive T lymphocytes (P < .05) were significantly higher in seropositive patients than in seronegative patients.",13,1993-Aug-15

To investigate the risk factors for developing uveitis in a regional cohort of patients with juvenile idiopathic arthritis (JIA) as classified under ILAR criteria.
PATIENTS AND METHODS: The clinical factors for developing uveitis and its visual outcome were studied retrospectively for all children diagnosed with JIA at Nottingham University Hospital, England from 1974 to 2001.
RESULTS: A total of 202 patients with juvenile idiopathic arthritis were identified. Twenty-three patients (11.4%) were found to have uveitis. The mean age of arthritis onset in those with uveitis was 4.9 (95% CI 3.4-6.4) and in those without uveitis was 7.6 (95% CI 7.0-8.3), p = 0.002. Both the persistent and extended oligoarthritis groups are at significant risk of developing uveitis on Kaplan-Meier analysis with p = 0.001 and 0.013, respectively, compared to other ILAR subtypes. Extended oligoarthritis (1 to 4 joints affected in first 6 months of disease but 5 or more cumulative joints after first 6 months) had the highest prevalence of uveitis (25%) among the ILAR subtypes. Patients with extended oligoarthritis also developed uveitis earlier than persistent group, p = 0.017. Gender, race, and antinuclear antibody (ANA) status were not significant risk factors. The visual outcome was favorable, with 90% achieving acuity of 6/12 or better.
CONCLUSION: Patients with extended oligoarthritis are at higher risk and have a shorter interval from diagnosis of arthritis to development of uveitis and need to be monitored more closely. Screening guideline for JIA-associated uveitis based on ILAR classification is called for.",13,2006-Dec-1

Experimental autoimmune uveoretinitis (EAU) is a widely used experimental animal model of human endogenous posterior uveoretinitis. In the present study, we performed in vivo imaging of the retina in transgenic reporter mice to investigate dynamic changes in exogenous inflammatory cells and endogenous immune cells during the disease process.
METHODS: Transgenic mice (C57Bl/6 J Cx 3 cr1 (GFP/+) , C57Bl/6 N CD11c-eYFP, and C57Bl/6 J LysM-eGFP) were used to visualize the dynamic changes of myeloid-derived cells, putative dendritic cells and neutrophils during EAU. Transgenic mice were monitored with multi-modal fundus imaging camera over five time points following disease induction with the retinal auto-antigen, interphotoreceptor retinoid binding protein (IRBP1-20). Disease severity was quantified with both clinical and histopathological grading.
RESULTS: In the normal C57Bl/6 J Cx 3 cr1 (GFP/+) mouse Cx3cr1-expressing microglia were evenly distributed in the retina. In C57Bl/6 N CD11c-eYFP mice clusters of CD11c-expressing cells were noted in the retina and in C57Bl/6 J LysM-eGFP mice very low numbers of LysM-expressing neutrophils were observed in the fundus. Following immunization with IRBP1-20, fundus examination revealed accumulations of Cx3cr1-GFP(+) myeloid cells, CD11c-eYFP(+) cells and LysM-eGFP(+) myelomonocytic cells around the optic nerve head and along retinal vessels as early as day 14 post-immunization. CD11c-eYFP(+) cells appear to resolve marginally earlier (day 21 post-immunization) than Cx3cr1-GFP(+) and LysM-eGFP(+) cells. The clinical grading of EAU in transgenic mice correlated closely with histopathological grading.
CONCLUSIONS: These results illustrate that in vivo fundus imaging of transgenic reporter mice allows direct visualization of various exogenously and endogenously derived leukocyte types during EAU progression. This approach acts as a valuable adjunct to other methods of studying the clinical course of EAU.",13,2015-Jan-27

Fuchs' heterochromic iridocyclitis (FHI) is a frequently overlooked cause of anterior uveitis. Improper diagnosis may lead to unnecessary therapy. Dark brown irides may demonstrate heterochromia poorly. We believe that FHI may be overlooked in blacks because of a frequent lack of obvious heterochromia and the frequent presence of iris nodules. Heterochromia is not necessary for the diagnosis of FHI if other clinical features of the syndrome are present. In our series of 54 whites and 13 blacks with FHI, heterochromia occurred in 50 (92%) whites and ten (76%) blacks (nonsignificant difference). Iris nodules occurred in 11 (20%) whites and four (30%) blacks (not significant). Statistically significant differences occurred with cataract/aphakia in 41 (75%) whites and three (23%) blacks and with glaucoma in six (11%) whites and five (38%) blacks.",13,1988-Dec-1

To analyze the clinical manifestations, remissions, and visual prognosis of intermediate uveitis in children, and to identify the risk factors for poor visual outcome.
DESIGN: Retrospective cohort study.
METHODS: Institutional study of 32 consecutive patients examined at a tertiary referral center with intermediate uveitis and the onset of ocular disease before the age of 16 years. Numerous variables were assessed, including age and gender distribution, laboratory data, the presence of systemic diseases, onset and course of ocular inflammation, clinical features and complications, therapeutic strategies and their outcomes, remission and final visual acuity, and characteristics associated with poor visual outcome.
RESULTS: Bilateral involvement was observed in 94% of the patients. Remission was observed in seven out of 15 patients (47%) with completed follow-up of five years. For our 32 subjects, we found a mean time to remission of 6.4 years (SE 0.7, CI 5.1 to 7.7). Visual outcome was favorable as only three patients developed unilateral acuity of less than 0.1 after five-year follow-up, and no additional blind eyes manifested. No associated systemic diseases were established. Optic disk edema was the most frequent complication observed (71%). Cystoid macular edema (CME) was observed in 44% of the patients and was the most common cause of visual loss.
CONCLUSIONS: Intermediate uveitis of childhood might exhibit a self-limiting course after several years. Visual loss was limited despite the high rate of severe ocular complications.",13,2006-Apr-1

The clinical signs of uveitis occur as a result of inflammation within the vascular coat of the eye, which causes breakdown of the blood-aqueous barrier and blood-retinal barrier. Many infectious and noninfectious causes can incite episodes of uveitis. Although a complete diagnostic evaluation is highly recommended to identify any underlying etiologic agent, many cases remain idiopathic in nature. The goals of therapy are preserving vision, minimizing pain, and halting inflammation.",13,2008-Mar-1

Blau syndrome (BS) is a rare dominantly inherited, inflammatory syndrome characterised by the clinical triad of granulomatous dermatitis, symmetric arthritis and recurrent uveitis. The caspase recruitment domain gene CARD15/NOD2 has been identified as the gene responsible for BS. In the majority of patients, the disease is characterised by early onset, usually before 3-4 years of age. Onset is most often articular and cutaneous. Eye symptoms usually start later; however, eye involvement is the most relevant morbidity of BS. Atypical cases of BS have been reported with involvement of organs other than skin, joint and eyes. Due to its rarity and the variations in the severity and evolution of its expressions, there have been no studies on the optimal treatment for patients with BS. If the therapeutic response to corticosteroids is unsatisfactory, additional treatment with immunosuppressive agents should be tried. The results with biologic anti-cytokine agents, such as infliximab and anakinra, are variable, particularly with regard to ocular morbidity. This review will focus on the clinical and genetics aspects of the familial and the sporadic form of BS. Further, we will describe an Italian family followed by us over the past 25 years.",13,2011-Oct-1

Although cystoid macular edema (CME) represents a major cause of visual loss in uveitis, the consensus on its treatment has not yet been reached. We performed a literature review on the efficacy of diverse medical treatment modalities for uveitic CME and suggest novel treatment recommendations. A literature search retrieved 173 citations (MEDLINE, conducted in March 2002, terms: macular edema, uveitis, treatment) and relevant publications were studied. The literature contained information based mainly on case series; the specific treatment targets were not clear. Causal treatment of the underlying ocular condition was considered essential and various approaches of symptomatic treatment were attempted (immunosuppressive and immunomodulatory agents, acetazolamide, octreotide), all with different inclusion criteria and evaluation protocols. The decision to initiate the symptomatic treatment of CME was usually made in cases with already compromised visual acuity. Despite aggressive treatment, the progression of CME with accompanying visual loss was common. On the basis of published results, we recommend starting treatment of CME at an early stage, even in eyes with full visual acuity. Randomized clinical trials are needed to determine the efficacy of diverse treatment modalities and to evaluate the effects of early intervention on inflammatory CME.",13,2002-Dec-1

The purpose of the study is to determine the frequency of syphilis exposure in patients with uveitis, identify patient characteristics associated with serologic fluorescent treponemal antibody assays (FTA-ABS) reactivity, and examine the clinical implications of syphilis exposure in patients with uveitis.
METHODS: A retrospective review of the records of 552 consecutive patients examined in the referral uveitis clinic of an urban eye hospital between January 1989 and January 1994 was performed.
RESULTS: Forty-four (8%) of 552 consecutive patients with uveitis had serologic evidence of syphilis exposure on the basis of a strongly reactive serum FTA-ABS. Syphilis was presumed to be the sole cause of uveitis in 24 patients (4.3%) over the 5-year period. The racial demographic profile of those patients with serologic evidence of syphilis was consistent with the reported distribution of syphilis cases, but there were relatively few identifiable risk factors for sexually transmitted disease (including only three patients who were positive with human immunodeficiency virus). The choice of antibiotic treatment of these patients was variable and sometimes suboptimal.
CONCLUSIONS: This study implicates syphilis exposure as a more common etiology of uveitis than did previous reports, advocates routine serum FTA-ABS testing of patients with uveitis, and indicates a need for a more aggressive role of the ophthalmologist in antibiotic treatment of patients with uveitis and syphilis exposure.",13,1997-Oct-1

To determine the efficacy of 0.5-mg and 0.1-mg sustained-release fluocinolone acetonide intravitreal implants to inhibit ocular inflammation in a rabbit model of severe uveitis.
METHODS: The in vitro pharmacokinetic profile of both the 0.5-mg and 0.1-mg sustained-release fluocinolone intravitreal implants was determined during a 10-day period. A sustained-release fluocinolone acetonide intravitreal implant with a release rate of either 0.5 microg/d (n = 16) or 0.1 microg/d (n = 16) was implanted into the vitreous cavity of the right eye in albino rabbits after a subcutaneous injection of tuberculin antigen. Control animals (n = 14) received empty devices. Uveitis was induced with an intravitreal tuberculin antigen injection. A masked observer graded anterior chamber flare, anterior chamber cells, vitreous opacity, and inflammation on histologic sections.
RESULTS: In vitro, the drug was released from both devices in a linear manner. In vivo, treated eyes were significantly less inflamed than untreated eyes (P< or =.02). Inflammation was suppressed to a greater degree with the 0.5-microg/d implant compared with the 0.1-microg/d implant.
CONCLUSION: Sustained-release fluocinolone intravitreal implants suppress ocular inflammation in a rabbit model of severe uveitis.

To describe the clinical outcome of phakic eyes with macular edema (ME) due to non-infectious uveitis treated with a dexamethasone intravitreal implant.
METHODS: A retrospective analysis of 41 eyes treated with a total of 58 dexamethasone intravitreal implants was conducted. Best corrected visual acuity (BCVA), central retinal thickness (CRT) and complications data were collected.
RESULTS: One month after the first implant, even as CRT improved significantly in most eyes (p<0.001), 31.7% showed no improvement in BCVA. At 6 months post-implantation, CRT and BCVA had deteriorated in up to 70% of patients. Thirteen eyes were re-implanted, with a similar effect to that of the first implant. Ocular hypertension developed in 36.2% of eyes, and three eyes had cataract surgery, all in eyes with repeated implants.
CONCLUSIONS: The dexamethasone intravitreal implant can be safely used to treat ME due to non-infectious uveitis, but with a limited and short effect on BCVA.",13,2017-Aug-1

To investigate the causes of endogenous uveitis in cats presenting to referral ophthalmology clinics in North Carolina.
PROCEDURE: Medical records of cats diagnosed with endogenous uveitis at North Carolina State University's College of Veterinary Medicine (NCSU-CVM) or Animal Eye Care Associates of Cary, NC between 2003 and 2015 were reviewed. Inclusion criteria were cats that had complete diagnostic workups, including clinical, clinicopathological, serological, and histopathological data, as well as imaging modalities. Serology was consistently completed for feline leukemia virus (FeLV), feline immunodeficiency virus (FIV), feline coronavirus (FCoV), Toxoplasma gondii, and Bartonella spp.
RESULTS: One hundred and twenty cats met the inclusion criteria. Seroprevalence of FeLV (2.7%), FIV (7.3%), FCoV (34.7%), T. gondii (23.7%), and Bartonella spp. (43.2%) was observed, with a combined seroprevalence of 59.2%. Nineteen cats (15.8%) were diagnosed with feline infectious peritonitis (FIP) based on clinical, hematological, serological, histopathological, and necropsy findings. The average age of all cases was 7.62 years, while the average age of cats diagnosed with FIP was 1.82 years. Neoplasia was diagnosed in six cats (5.0%). No underlying etiology was found in 49 cats (40.8%).
CONCLUSIONS: Both idiopathic and neoplastic causes of uveitis were less prevalent than previously reported in studies, while seropositivity was higher than previously reported for the study area. This may be due to improved diagnostic capabilities or that cats with infectious disease were more likely to be referred. Because of the high prevalence of FIP, young cats with uveitis should be evaluated for hyperglobulinemia and FCoV serology should be performed as minimal diagnostics.",13,2016-Jul-1

To assess the efficacy and safety of adalimumab in patients with juvenile idiopathic arthritis (JIA) and associated refractory uveitis.
DESIGN: Multicenter, prospective case series.
METHODS: Thirty-nine patients (mean [SD] age of 11.5 [7.9] years) with JIA-associated uveitis who were either not responsive to standard immunosuppressive therapy or intolerant to it were enrolled. Patients aged 13-17 years were treated with 40 mg of adalimumab every other week for 6 months and those aged 4-12 years received 24 mg/m(2) body surface.
RESULTS: Inflammation of the anterior chamber (2.02 [1.16] versus 0.42 [0.62]) and of the posterior segment (2.38 [2.97] versus 0.35 [0.71] decreased significantly between baseline and the final visit (P < 0.001). The mean (SD) macular thickness at baseline was 304.54 (125.03)  μ and at the end of follow-up was 230.87 (31.12)  μ (P < 0.014). Baseline immunosuppression load was 8.10 (3.99) as compared with 5.08 (3.76) at the final visit (P < 0.001). The mean dose of corticosteroids also decreased from 0.25 (0.43) to 0 (0.02) mg (P < 0.001). No significant side effects requiring discontinuation of therapy were observed.
CONCLUSION: Adalimumab seems to be an effective and safe treatment for JIA-associated refractory uveitis and may reduce steroid requirement.",13,2013-1-1

Endotoxin induced uveitis has been regarded as a model for acute anterior uveitis and until now little was known about choroidal involvement. The aim of this study was to investigate changes in macrophages and MHC class II positive cells in the choroid of Lewis rats during endotoxin induced uveitis.
METHODS: Choroid-sclera wholemounts were isolated from normal Lewis rats and at different time points--4, 8, 16, 24, 48, 72, and 96 hours, and 7, 10, and 14 days after a footpad injection of 200 micrograms of lipopolysaccharide (LPS). Immunohistochemistry was performed using the monoclonal antibodies ED1 (monocytes, macrophages, dendritic cells), and OX6 (MHC class II antigen).
RESULTS: In normal rats, two layers of macrophages were identified in the choroid; a layer located immediately beneath the retinal pigment epithelium (RPE) and a layer bordering the sclera. The density of ED1 positive cells in the layer bordering the RPE cells was 902 (SD 132) cells/mm2 whereas the scleral layer had a cell density of 389 (73) cells/mm2. Based on morphology, positive cells could be divided into two main categories; pleomorphic/round cells and dendritiform cells with varying appearances, with the latter being predominant in normal eyes. A network of MHC class II positive dendritic cells was found in the choroid, beneath the RPE, with a density of 659 (96) cells/mm2. No MHC class II positive cells were found in the macrophage layer bordering the sclera. LPS injection caused a massive influx of ED1 positive macrophages in the area below the RPE cells but did not result in an influx of macrophages at the scleral side of the choroid. The infiltrate reached a maximum at 16 hours following LPS injection and decreased at 96 hours. The morphology of the infiltrating cells was pleomorphic/round at early stages of inflammation and changed into a dendritiform cell population later. The number of MHC class II positive cells on the anterior side of the choroid increased 8 hours after injection and reached a peak at 72-96 hours. MHC class II positive cells were not observed in the vicinity of the sclera at any time after LPS injection. Both resident and MHC class II positive dendritic cell numbers returned to normal values at day 14 following LPS injection.
CONCLUSIONS: These results indicate that the choroid is severely inflamed after systemic LPS administration to Lewis rats and suggests that endotoxin induced uveitis may serve as a model for generalised uveitis in humans.",13,1997-May-1

To investigate the long-term visual results after cataract extraction in patients with uveitis, and to demonstrate the long-term viability of intraocular lenses.
DESIGN: In all, 61 patients (72 eyes), with update clinical examination, were retrospectively evaluated. Comparison of preoperative, postoperative, and latest visual function including best-corrected Snellen visual acuity, progression of uveitis and its complications, need for postoperative medical or surgical interventions.
RESULTS: After a minimum follow-up of 5 years (mean 7 years 7 months), 82% of eyes maintained a visual improvement of two Snellen lines, 74% maintained 6/9 or better, and 14% had 6/18 or worse. The mode acuity was better than 6/6. The prevalence of macular oedema or scarring was 24%, of posterior capsule opacification 96%, and of glaucoma drainage, 15%.
CONCLUSIONS: We report the long-term follow-up of cataract extraction and intraocular lens (IOL) implantation performed by a single surgeon on patients with uveitis attending a regional tertiary referral uveitis clinic. Using stringent perioperative and postoperative control of inflammation, patients with uveitis usually maintain high visual acuity over long-term follow-up. The incidence of sight-threatening postoperative complications is low and no ongoing complication has been attributed to IOL implantation.",13,2005-Feb-1

The tuberculin skin test, used to detect latent systemic tuberculosis (TB), has its limitations. The utility of interferon-gamma assays, found useful in the diagnosis of latent TB, is still unestablished in tubercular uveitis. We present the results of QuantiFERON(®)-TB Gold (QFT-G) test and its relevance in the diagnosis and management of suspected tubercular uveitis in India. All suspected tubercular uveitis patients seen at our uveitis clinic between October 2006 and June 2008 who underwent relevant blood investigations, chest X-rays, Mantoux tests and QFT-G tests were included. Clinical profile, systemic correlation and outcome with treatment were analysed. Fifty suspected tubercular uveitis patients underwent QFT-G testing. The age range of the patients was 6-55 years (mean 32.66 years). Seven patients presented with active and three with a past history of systemic TB. The QFT-G test was positive in 29 patients. Radiological findings of TB were seen in four patients with a positive QFT-G and one patient with a negative QFT-G test. In 11 patients both QFT-G and Mantoux tests were positive. Eighteen Mantoux-negative patients were QFT-G-positive. Significantly, no patient with a positive Mantoux had a negative QFT-G test. Of the 32 patients with posterior uveitis, 17 patients had serpiginous choroiditis, four patients had a choroidal granuloma, six patients had multifocal choroiditis, four patients had retinal vasculitis, and one patient had a subretinal abscess. All QFT-G-positive patients were treated with anti-tuberculosis therapy as well as systemic steroids with a favorable clinical outcome. Our study shows that the QFT-G test is very useful in the diagnosis and management of suspected ocular TB. It was found to be very sensitive in identifying latent TB patients who, upon treatment, had a significantly reduced frequency of recurrences. It was more sensitive than the Mantoux test and is not significantly affected by previous treatment with systemic steroids or immunosuppressives. A negative QFT-G test can also be used as an adjunct before initiation of systemic steroids or immunosuppressives in uveitic patients particularly in an endemic setting like India.",13,2012-Jun-1

To evaluate CD4(+)Foxp3(+) (forkhead box P3) T-regulatory cell populations in patients with uveitis and to determine if T-regulatory cell populations are associated with disease features.
METHODS: Patients with uveitis were evaluated for CD4(+)Foxp3(+) T-regulatory cells by flow cytometry. Systemic and ocular diagnoses, disease activity, and the presence of cystoid macular edema were reviewed. Percentages of CD4(+)Foxp3(+) lymphocytes were compared for patients with inactive vs active disease, systemic vs ocular diagnoses, and the presence or absence of cystoid macular edema. Real-time polymerase chain reaction testing was performed on 2 patients with extremely low CD4(+)Foxp3(+) cell populations to assess Foxp3 mRNA.
RESULTS: A total of 20 patients with intermediate uveitis, posterior uveitis, and panuveitis were evaluated. The mean age was 40.6 years and the mean visual acuity was 20/57. Percentages of CD4(+)Foxp3(+) cells were lower in patients with active compared with inactive uveitis (P< .05). No differences in T-regulatory cells were observed between the other subgroups. Two patients with recalcitrant uveitis who demonstrated less than 1% CD4(+)Foxp3(+) lymphocytes showed extremely low or absent Foxp3 mRNA.
CONCLUSION: T-regulatory cells are reduced in patients with active compared with inactive disease. Severe depletion of CD4(+)Foxp3(+) T cells and Foxp3 mRNA in 2 patients with severe uveitis suggests that loss of the T-regulatory cells of uveitis may be a salient feature in certain patients.",13,2009-Apr-1

Intestinal microbes have profound effects on inflammatory autoimmunity in sites distant from the gut. The mechanisms whereby this happens are only now beginning to be understood and may include such diverse effects as innate stimulation of migrating immune cells and effects of circulating bacterial metabolites. Our studies add to this the demonstration that microbiota may provide a source of cross-reactive antigenic material that activates autoreactive lymphocytes within the gut environment. In a spontaneous model of autoimmune uveitis, T lymphocytes specific to a retinal autoantigen are activated through their specific antigen receptor in the gut and acquire the ability to fuel inflammatory autoimmunity in the eye. In view of the huge diversity of commensals, it is conceivable that they may provide surrogate antigens for activation of autoreactive lymphocytes(s) of other tissue specificities, and might therefore be involved in the etiology of autoimmune diseases more frequently than is currently appreciated.",13,2016-Sep-1

Eye globe abnormalities can be readily detected on dedicated and non-dedicated CT and MR studies. A primary understanding of the globe anatomy is key to characterising both traumatic and non-traumatic globe abnormalities. The globe consists of three primary layers: the sclera (outer), uvea (middle), and retina (inner layer). The various pathological processes involving these layers are highlighted using case examples with fundoscopic correlation where appropriate. In the emergent setting, trauma can result in hemorrhage, retinal/choroidal detachment and globe rupture. Neoplasms and inflammatory/infective processes predominantly occur in the vascular middle layer. The radiologist has an important role in primary diagnosis contributing to appropriate ophthalmology referral, thereby preventing devastating consequences such as vision loss.",13,2016-1-1

Although TINU syndrome is characterized by idiopathic TIN with bilateral anterior uveitis, few reports have provided a comprehensive summary of the features of this disorder. Previous reports have suggested that many Japanese patients had HLA-A2 and -A24 (7), but there is no evidence.
CASE REPORT: A 44-year-old female was referred to our hospital due to renal dysfunction in March 2012. After admission, her symptoms improved spontaneously without medication within 2 weeks. In the outpatient clinic, she was diagnosed with idiopathic bilateral anterior uveitis in May, and her renal dysfunction relapsed in November. A renal biopsy showed diffuse TIN. We made a diagnosis of TINU syndrome because we could not explain the origin, and treated her with a systemic corticosteroid. Her renal function and ocular symptoms have been improving. The patient had HLA-A24, -B7, -DR1, -C*07: 02 and -DQB1*05: 01: 01. We collected 102 Japanese cases in PubMed, Ovid MEDLINE, and the Japanese Medical Abstracts Society and compared our case with the previous cases.
CONCLUSIONS: This disorder affects primarily young females (median age, 14 years), and the most common symptom is fever (44/102 cases). We conducted a statistical analysis using contingency table and Pearson's chi-square test, for HLA-A2 and A24, and calculated the odds ratio (OR). There are no significant differences (A2 was present in 7/22 cases and in 19/50 controls, p value (P) 0.61, OR 0.76 (95% confidence interval (CI)) 0.27-2.2; A24 was present in 10/22 cases and in 33/50 controls, P 0.10, OR 0.43, CI 0.16-1.2).",13,2015-Feb-28

Anterior Uveitis is the most common form of uveitis. There are several known and many possible etiologies for anterior uveitis. After examining the posterior segment and ruling out masquerade syndromes, the main step of etiologic diagnosis is clinical characterization. It is essential to establish the presence or absence of unilateral versus bilateral and granulomatous features. Subsequently, a directed work-up may be obtained which then helps to confirm diagnostic hypotheses based on the detailed history and clinical examination. The priority is to rule out an infection. Treatments are adapted according to etiology and disease severity. Finally, biologics have greatly changed the management and prevention of some forms of anterior uveitis, in particular uveitis associated with HLA-B27 and juvenile idiopathic arthritis-associated anterior uveitis.",13,2018-Jan-1

Innate immune receptors such as the nucleotide-binding domain, leucine-rich repeat-containing (NBD-LRR) receptors, referred to as NLRs, are known to serve as a critical component of host defense. However, their participation in inflammatory responses within immune privileged sites such as the brain and eye is less understood. The potential importance of NLRs in regulation of inflammation within these particular sites is further underscored by their association with autoinflammatory disorders, wherein localized inflammation can occur within the brain or eye as neuroinflammation or uveitis, respectively. Many NLRs are expressed within the brain and eye and in this review, we discuss their roles in the inflammation of the central nervous system (CNS) and uveitis.",13,2011-Aug-1

We studied the efficacy and tolerance of humanized Ab interfering with the signal of the IL-2 and IL-15 receptors in a primate model of experimental autoimmune uveoretinitis. The inhibitory effects of humanized anti-Tac (HAT), an anti-IL-2R alpha-chain Ab, and HuMik beta1, an Ab directed at the beta-chain shared by the receptors of IL-2 and IL-15, were tested in culture on the proliferative response of monkey Con A-blast lymphocytes stimulated with IL-2 or IL-15. Uveitis was induced in cynomolgus monkeys by immunization with human recombinant retinal S-antigen. Treatment was initiated at the first sign of disease and consisted of HAT and HuMik beta1, alone or in combination, or vehicle control given by i.v. injection twice a week for 4 wk. Disease was evaluated by ocular funduscopy. The results in culture showed a significant dose-dependent inhibition of the IL-2-driven proliferation of lymphocytes by HAT. HuMik beta1 alone was ineffective against IL-2 stimulation, but had a marked potentiating effect in combination with HAT, independent of IL-15 signaling. IL-15-driven proliferation was inhibited by HuMik beta1, but not by HAT alone or in combination. In monkeys, experimental autoimmune uveoretinitis evolution was significantly inhibited by HAT treatment. HuMik beta1 alone had no effect on the disease. However, when used in combination, the two Ab markedly reduced the severity of ocular inflammation. The Ab were well tolerated. Only three monkeys, treated with HAT alone, made an Ab response against the injected Ab.",13,1997-Jan-01

To screen for psychological disorders in patients with active uveitis.
METHODS: Patients were screened for depression (BDI-II), state anxiety (STAI-I), VR-QOL (NEI-VFQ-25), and HR-QOL (SF-36). Association of depression and anxiety with sociodemographic and clinical parameters and with VR-QOL and HR-QOL were analyzed. Multivariate linear regression models were constructed for NEI-VFQ-25 and SF-36 subscales.
RESULTS: Of 99 patients, 37.3% screened positive for depression and 52.5% for anxiety. Depressed patients had lower visual acuity in the better seeing eye (p = 0.013) and more frequently panuveitis (p = 0.018). Anxious patients were younger (p = 0.009), had earlier onset of uveitis (p = 0.015), and had more frequently panuveitis (p = 0.016). Bivariate comparisons showed significant associations between psychological disorders and VR-QOL and HR-QOL. Significant bivariate associations were mostly lost in multivariate analyses for anxiety, but were preserved for depression.
CONCLUSIONS: A positive screening test for depression and anxiety is common in patients with uveitis. Low vision and panuveitis are associated with depression. Depression is associated with impairment of VR-QOL and HR-QOL.",13,2018-1-1

Endotoxin-induced uveitis (EIU) is commonly used in animals to mimic ocular inflammation in humans. Although the peripheral aspects of EIU have been well studied, little is known of the central neural effects of anterior eye inflammation. EIU was induced in male rats by endotoxin or lipopolysaccharide (LPS, 1 mg/kg ip) given 2 or 7 days earlier. Neurons responsive to mechanical stimulation of the ocular surface were recorded under barbiturate anesthesia at the trigeminal subnucleus interpolaris/caudalis (Vi/Vc) transition and subnucleus caudalis/cervical cord (Vc/C1) junction, the main terminal regions for corneal nociceptors. Two days after LPS, Vc/C1 units had reduced responses to histamine, nicotine, and CO(2) gas applied to the ocular surface, whereas unit responses were increased 7 days after LPS. Those units with convergent cutaneous receptive fields at Vc/C1 were enlarged 7 days after LPS. Units at the Vi/Vc transition also had reduced responses to histamine and CO(2) 2 days after LPS but no enhancement was seen at 7 days. Tear volume evoked by CO(2) was reduced 2 days after LPS and returned toward control values by 7 days, whereas CO(2)-evoked eye blinks were normal at 2 days and increased 7 days after LPS. These results indicate that a single exposure to endotoxin causes long-term changes in the excitability of second-order neurons responsive to noxious ocular stimulation. The differential effects of EIU on tear volume and eye blink lend further support for the hypothesis that ocular-sensitive neurons at the Vi/Vc transition and Vc/C1 junction regions mediate different aspects of pain during intraocular inflammation.",13,2005-Dec-1

To evaluate the safety and efficacy of intravitreal triamcinolone acetonide (TA) for treating macular edema secondary to non-infectious uveitis.
METHODS: Retrospective review of sixteen patients (20 eyes) with chronic cystoid macular edema (CME) as a consequence of controlled intermediate uveitis, posterior uveitis, or panuveitis who received at least one intravitreal injection of TA. Main outcome measures were visual acuity (VA), intraocular pressure (IOP), formation or progression of an existing cataract, and CME resolution during the follow-up period.
RESULTS: At last follow-up, VA showed improvement (compared to baseline) in 11 eyes (55%), deterioration in three eyes (15%), remained completely unchanged in one eye (5%), and showed improvement initially but returned to baseline levels in five eyes (25%). At last follow-up, CME had relapsed or was still present in 10 of the eyes (50%). The remaining eyes showed complete resolution of the CME, without evidence of recurrence during the follow-up time. Mean VA at last follow-up showed statistically significant improvement (p = 0.02) in nonvitrectomized eyes (mean baseline VA: 1.14 +/- 0.58; mean final VA: 0.96 +/- 0.66) compared to the almost unaltered mean visual acuity for vitrectomized eyes (mean baseline VA: 0.76 +/- 0.41; mean final VA: 0.71 +/- 0.48)(p = 0.40, paired samples t-test). Elevation of IOP was transient in all cases and responded well to topical medications, except for one patient who required placement of an Ahmed valve. Preexisting cataract progressed in three of the 15 phakic eyes (20%). One patient developed a retinal detachment and required additional surgery to reattach it. Patients were followed for a mean of 34 weeks (median: 32 weeks; range: 19-56 weeks).
CONCLUSIONS: Intravitreal TA may play a role in the treatment of uveitis-related CME. Further controlled studies are necessary to test this hypothesis.",13,2005-1-1

The human leukocyte antigen (HLA) genotype has been shown to associate with tubulointerstitial nephritis (TIN) and tubulointerstitial nephritis with uveitis syndrome (TINU). The association of HLA genes with TIN was examined in this nation-wide study. HLA genotyping was performed in 31 pediatric patients with biopsy-proven TIN. All patients were examined by an ophthalmologist to diagnose possible uveitis. Class II HLA genotypes of TIN patients were compared with the Finnish reference population. We found a significant association between the HLA alleles DQA1*04:01 [risk ratio (RR) 5.0, 95% confidence interval (CI) 2.0-11.2], DQB1*04:02 (RR 2.7, 95% CI 1.4-5.3), and DRB1*08 (RR 3.8, 95% CI 1.5-8.4) and TIN. Uveitis was found in 20/31 (64.5%) patients. HLA genotyping of the TINU patients showed additional risk HLA alleles: DQA1*01:04 (RR 6.1, 95% CI 1.5-17.8), and DRB1*14 (RR 8.2, 95% CI 2.2-22.1). The alleles DQA1*01:04 (RR 8.8, 95% CI 2.2-26.5), DQA1*04:01 (RR 3.2, 95% CI 1.2-7.3), and DRB1*14 (RR 12.0, 95% CI 3.2-33.0) were more frequent in patients with TIN and chronic uveitis than in reference population. The HLA class II haplotype DQA1*04:01/DQB1:04:02/DRB1*08 was the most common combination in our study population (58.1%). None of the patients had haplotype DQA1*04:01/DQB1*06:02/DRB1*15, which is common in Finland. HLA genotype did not predict the renal outcome. We found a strong association between certain HLA genotypes both in TIN and TINU patients. The TIN/TINU-associated HLA alleles appear to vary depending on study population.",13,2013-Jun-1

To analyse the prevalence, incidence and aetiology of paediatric uveitis.
METHODS: A retrospective, population-based cohort study of Finnish children with uveitis in Northern Ostrobothnia Hospital District in 2008-2017. The data included parameters for age, gender, age at diagnosis, laterality, chronicity, anatomical distribution of the disease, aetiology and systemic association.
RESULTS: One hundred fifty patients aged <16 years (mean age 6.9 ± 3.9 years) with uveitis were included, out of whom 53% were girls. The first uveitis episode occurred at 1-6 years in 59%, and 62% of them were girls. In the age group of 7-15 years, boys were diagnosed with uveitis more frequently than girls (61% versus 39%, respectively). Seventy percent of the girls were diagnosed with their first uveitis episode at the age of 1-6 years, whereas only 48% of the boys were diagnosed at that age. The prevalence of uveitis increased from 64/100 000 children <16 years in 2008 (95% CI, 47.7-84.2) to 106/100 000 in 2017 (95% CI, 84.6-130.2). The incidence of childhood uveitis in 2008-2017 was 14/100 000 person-years in children <16 years (95% CI, 11.3-16.5). Eighty-seven percent of the cases were non-infectious, 9% were infectious, and 3% had masquerade syndromes. Sixty-one percent of patients had juvenile idiopathic arthritis (JIA).
CONCLUSION: The prevalence of paediatric uveitis has increased during the last decade in both genders. Uveitis is more frequent in girls, and they were diagnosed at a younger age than boys. Idiopathic cases and JIA accounted for a majority of aetiological features.",13,2021-Mar-1

Laser flare-cell photometry enables objective and quantitative measurement of anterior chamber inflammation. Systematic data currently are used mainly for clinical research; few are yet available in uveitis. The authors prospectively studied the amount, duration, and pattern of inflammation for well-defined uveitic conditions and evaluated the potential usefulness of laser flare-cell photometry in uveitis.
METHODS: Mean initial flare was calculated in HLA-B27-positive acute anterior uveitis, acute herpes zoster uveitis, acute retinal necrosis (ARN), Fuchs heterochromic cyclitis, intermediate uveitis (pars planitis-type), posterior sarcoidosis, posterior pole toxoplasmosis, and birdshot chorioretinopathy. Evolution of aqueous flare and cells was analyzed for acute anterior uveitis, ARN, and pars planitis treated for cystoid macular edema (CME), all of which received a standardized therapy.
RESULTS: Blood-aqueous barrier disruption was very pronounced in acute anterior uveitis (170.2 +/- 33 photons/msecond), ARN (177.4 +/- 88 photons/msecond), moderate in posterior sarcoidosis (38.1 +/- 11 photons/msecond), acute zoster uveitis (25.8 +/- 6.1 photons/msecond), and pars planitis (19.1 +/- 2.9 photons/msecond) but only minimal in Fuchs heterochromic cyclitis (10.2 +/- 3.5 photons/msecond), toxoplasmosis (9.0 +/- 1.2 photons/msecond) and birdshot chorioretinopathy (5.7 +/- 1.1 photons/msecond). For acute anterior uveitis, ARN, and pars planitis with CME, the inflammatory patterns were determined. The potential of laser flare-cell photometry for precise follow-up and adjustment of therapy was illustrated in cases of anterior and posterior uveitis.
CONCLUSION: The authors' findings show that laser flare-cell photometry allows quantitative assessment of inflammation in uveitis and contributes to improved management of patients with uveitis.",13,1994-Apr-1

To determine the long-term efficacy, complications, and duration of effect of a cyclosporine (CsA) suprachoroidal implant (CSI) in horses with equine recurrent uveitis (ERU).
METHODS: Horses with ERU were treated with a 6-mm diameter, 25 mg, reservoir matrix CsA implant in the deep sclera adjacent to the suprachoroidal space. Horses with follow-up >1 year were examined for frequency of uveitis episodes, complications, and vision at last recheck.
RESULTS: Data from 151 eyes of 133 horses from the USA and Europe that had CsA devices implanted for ERU were reviewed. Follow-up time ranged from 13 to 85 months after surgery, with a mean and median follow-up time of 28.9 and 26.3 months, respectively. Overall, at last follow-up 78.8% of eyes were considered visual and the overall mean frequency of uveitis episodes after CSI was 0.09 ± SD 0.08 episodes per month. The most common complications leading to vision loss at last follow-up were persistent uveitis episodes (54%), glaucoma (22%), mature cataracts (16%), and retinal detachment (6%). Persistent uveitis episodes tended to be the highest cause of vision loss in horses with <24 months and >48 months of follow-up.
CONCLUSIONS: This study demonstrated the long-term maintenance of vision of horses with ERU implanted with a CSI. The increased vision loss related to uveitis episode of inflammation in eyes after the likely depletion of CsA from the CSI suggests that a repeat CSI may be required at or before 48 months after surgery.",13,2010-Sep-1

Endotoxin-induced uveitis (EIU) is an animal model for acute ocular inflammation. Several substances play major roles in the development of inflammatory changes in EIU, including tumor necrosis factor-α (TNF-α), interleukin (IL)-1β, and IL-6. These inflammatory cytokines trigger the degradation of IκB by activating IκB kinases (IKKs). Released nuclear factor kappaB (NFκB) subsequently translocates to the nucleus, where NFκB expresses its proinflammatory function. IMD-0354, N-(3,5-Bis-trifluoromethylphenyl)-5-chloro-2-hydroxybenzamide, selectively inhibits IKKβ, particularly when induced by proinflammatory cytokines, such as TNF-α and IL-1β. In the present study, we examined whether IKKβ inhibition has therapeutic effects on EIU by using IMD-0354 and its prodrug IMD-1041.
METHODS: Six-week-old male Lewis rats were used. EIU was induced with subcutaneous injections of 200 μg of lipopolysaccharide (LPS) from Escherichia coli that had been diluted in 0.1 ml of phosphate-buffered saline. IMD-0354 was administered intraperitoneally at 30, 10, 3, or 0 mg/kg, suspended in 1.0 ml of 0.5% carboxymethyl cellulose sodium. The prodrug IMD-1041 (100 mg/kg) was also administered orally. The rats were euthanized 24 h after LPS injection, and EIU severity was evaluated histologically. The number of infiltrating cells and the protein, TNF-α, and monocyte chemoattractant protein-1 (MCP-1) concentrations in the aqueous humor were determined. TNF-α and MCP-1 concentrations were quantified with enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. Eye sections were also stained with anti-NFκB and phosphorylated I-κBα antibodies.
RESULTS: The number of infiltrating cells in aqueous humor was 53.6±9.8×10(5), 72.5±17.0×10(5), 127.25±32.0×10(5), and 132.0±25.0×10(5) cells/ml in rats treated with 30, 10, 3, or 0 mg/kg of IMD-0354, respectively. The total protein concentrations of aqueous humor were 92.6±3.1 mg/ml, 101.5±6.8 mg/ml, 112.6±1.9 mg/ml, and 117.33±1.8 mg/ml in rats treated with 30, 10, 3, and 0 mg/kg of IMD-0354, respectively. Infiltrating cells and protein concentrations were significantly decreased by treatment with IMD-0354 (p<0.01). IMD-0354 treatment significantly reduced the concentration of TNF-α (p<0.05) and MCP-1 (p<0.01) in aqueous humor. The number of NFκB positive nuclei was reduced when treated with IMD-0354. Furthermore, IMD-0354-treated EIU rats showed only background levels of phosphorylated I-κBα; however, it was strongly expressed in the iris-ciliary body cell cytoplasm of the IMD-0354 untreated EIU rats. Oral administration of IMD-1041 also decreased the cell number (p<0.01) and protein concentration (p<0.05) of aqueous humor in EIU.
CONCLUSIONS: Acute uveitis was ameliorated by inhibition of IKKβ in rats. IMD-0354 and its prodrug IMD-1041 seem to be promising candidates for treating intraocular inflammation/uveitis.",13,2012-1-1

To investigate the safety and efficacy of phacoemulsification with intraocular lens implantation in eyes affected by uveitis.
METHODS: A retrospective case series is presented including casenote review and update patient examinations. Patient data were withdrawn from the Uveitis Clinic database. All uveitis patients undergoing phacoemulsification with intraocular lens implantation from August 1995 to November 2000 were included. A pre-operative preparation protocol was used. Operative and post-operative complications, degree of postoperative inflammation, best-corrected and final visual acuity were the main outcome measures.
RESULTS: Eighty-six eyes of 75 patients underwent surgery, which in 11 cases was combined with trabeculectomy. Mean follow-up was 24.1 months. Eight eyes (10%) had severe or fibrinous uveitis post-operatively. The mean delay between surgery and return to baseline treatment was 8.6 weeks. Posterior capsule opacification occurred in 42% of eyes and Nd-YAG capsulotomy was required in 21%. Cystoid macular oedema was seen in 2 eyes. Seventy-two per cent of eyes retain a visual acuity of 6/9 or better, and 87% of eyes retain a post-operative improvement of 2 or more lines of Snellen acuity.
CONCLUSIONS: With careful patient selection, appropriate pre-operative preparation, diligent surgery and close post-operative supervision, phacoemulsification with intraocular lens implantation is safe and effective in the great majority of eyes with uveitis.",13,2001-Oct-1

The aim of this study was to investigate the role of Th1 (IFN-gamma and IL-12), Th2 (IL-10) cytokines and nitric oxide (NO) in the immunopathologic mechanisms of uveitis related to Behçet's disease and isolated idiopathic uveitis.
PATIENTS AND METHOD: This study was conducted on 24 patients with Behçet's syndrome who had active uveitis, ten of whom showed isolated uveitis classified as idiopathic uveitis, and 13 healthy controls. The levels of IFN-gamma, IL-12 and IL-10 in sera and supernatants of PBMC cultures stimulated by PHA were estimated using immunoenzymatic dosage (ELISA sandwich according to the methods recommended by Immunotech France). The production of NO was measured in vivo and in vitro for the same patients using the modified Griess method.
RESULTS: The induction of IFN-gamma and IL-12 was higher in the two groups of patients than in the controls (P<0.001). Significant IL-10 levels were recorded in 56.5% of patients with Behçet's disease presenting uveitis versus 30% of patients with idiopathic uveitis. NO production was more pronounced in idiopathic uveitis than in Behçet's syndrome (P<0.02).
CONCLUSION: The predominance of the Th1 profile was associated with high production of NO in idiopathic uveitis. A Th1/Th2 profile with a moderated increase in NO production was observed in Behçet's disease. Our data have a clinical impact. The observation of combined Th1/Th2 cytokines and NO elevation in both in vivo an in vitro experiments could have a predictive value in characterizing uveitis associated with Behçet's disease.",13,2006-Feb-1

PURPOSE. A marked cellular infiltrate has been observed when endotoxin (lipopolysaccharide [LPS]) is injected into the mouse eye, but systemically injected LPS does not produce a comparable effect. Several hypotheses were tested to reconcile this discordance. METHODS. BALB/c mice were injected intravitreally (ivt) or intraperitoneally (ip) with Escherichia coli LPS. Uveitis was assessed by traditional and intravital microscopy. Cytokine levels in the eye, plasma, or spleen were measured by single or multiplex ELISA assays. RESULTS. The eye's higher sensitivity was confirmed to local LPS exposure, as 250 ng ivt LPS produced a brisk leukocytic infiltrate whereas ip injection of 100 μg LPS did not. The hypothesis was tested that the lack of a cellular infiltrate after ip LPS is explained by less induction of cytokines in the eye, but surprisingly, ip LPS resulted in comparable cytokine levels to ivt LPS. The hypothesis was disproved that the eye's sensitivity to local LPS is due to lack of expression of intracellular inhibitors of LPS such as A20, IRAK-M, or SARM. Finally, the hypothesis that systemic LPS inhibits diapedesis was tested by injection of LPS ip and ivt simultaneously, a strategy that did not significantly reduce leukocyte rolling or sticking in iris vessels but blocked the cellular infiltrate normally seen with ivt LPS. CONCLUSIONS. Systemic and local LPS exposures produce discordant effects within the murine eye. The hypothesis that systemic LPS desensitizes leukocytes to the stimuli responsible for transmigration offers a plausible explanation for this discordance.",13,2011-Aug-17

Uveitis is the most common form of intraocular inflammatory disease and is a significant cause of visual impairment worldwide. Aetiologically, uveitis can also be classified into infectious uveitis and non-infectious uveitis. The common non-infectious forms of uveitis include acute anterior uveitis (AAU), Behçet's disease (BD), Vogt-Koyanagi-Harada (VKH) disease, birdshot chorioretinopathy (BSCR), sarcoid uveitis. In addition, a few monogenic autoinflammatory disorders can also cause uveitis, such as Blau Syndrome and haploinsufficiency of A20 (HA20). Although the exact pathogenesis of non-infectious uveitis is still unclear, it is well-recognised that it involves both genetic and environmental risk factors. A hallmark of uveitis is its strong associations with human leucocyte antigens (HLA). For examples, AAU, BD and BSCR are strongly associated with HLA-B27, HLA-B51, and HLA-A29, respectively. In uveitis studies, multiple GWAS have successfully been conducted and led to identification of novel susceptibility loci, for example, IL23R has been identified in BD, VKH and AAU. In this review, we summarize the latest progress on the genetic associations of both HLA and non-HLA genes with major forms of uveitis, including AAU, BD, VKH, BSCR, sarcoid uveitis, Blau Syndrome and HA20, and potential future research directions.",13,2022-Apr-1

Although there are many reports on Juvenile Idiopathic arthritis-associated uveitis (JIA-U) from various countries, especially from Europe and North America, there are few reports from Asia. Our aim was to investigate the epidemiology, characteristics and predictors of JIA-U in Japan.
METHODS: Data were retrospectively collected on 726 patients with JIA from medical records as of April 2016 at 15 medical centers specialized in pediatric rheumatic diseases. Of these, patients with uveitis were further investigated for the specific characteristics of this manifestation.
RESULTS: The prevalence of uveitis was 6.1% in the 726 JIA patients examined. Incidence of uveitis was significantly higher in patients with an earlier arthritis onset (2.6-vs.-5.8 years, P < 0.0001), oligoarthritis (16.1%-vs.-1.6%, P < 0.001), or anti-nuclear antibodies. On the contrary, it was significantly less common in patients with rheumatoid factor or anti-cyclic citrullinated peptide antibodies. A history of using methotrexate (MTX), infliximab or adalimumab was also associated with uveitis occurrence. The median age at uveitis diagnosis was 5 years, and the median time from arthritis onset to uveitis diagnosis was 2 years. The occurrence of anterior and bilateral uveitis was 79.3 and 53.7%, respectively. There were no symptoms at uveitis diagnosis in 58.5% of cases. Complications arising between the time of uveitis diagnosis and the last observation increased from 31.7 to 56.1%; in particular, cataract was increased 3-fold. While no patients lost their vision, 61.9% did not recover normal vision (≥ 1.0), and in many cases active uveitis persisted, especially in males. In addition to steroid eye drops (97.6%) and MTX (15.4%), biological agents were used for treating the uveitis in 41.5% of patients.
CONCLUSIONS: The epidemiology, characteristics and predictors of JIA-U in Japan are described here for the first time. Although the prevalence of JIA-U in Japan is lower than in predominantly Caucasian cohorts, as reported from North America and Europe, the epidemiology, characteristics and predictors were found to be similar.",13,2019-Apr-11

Visual loss in infectious posterior uveitis or panuveitis can occur if proper therapy is delayed because of diagnostic uncertainty. Some disorders, such as acute retinal necrosis and bacterial endophthalmitis, can be rapidly progressive, and therefore require prompt and accurate diagnosis to guide initial therapy. Other more slowly evolving infections, such as toxoplasmic chorioretinitis or fungal endophthalmitis, can be worsened by empiric use of corticosteroids without specific antimicrobial coverage. Key ocular diagnostic features are helpful but highly variable with overlap with both non-infectious uveitis and neoplastic masquerades, even for key signs such as hypopyon. Close examination of the fundus with attention to color, location, size, border, and opacity of lesions and associated arteriolitis or frosted branch angiitis is helpful in the diagnosis of chorioretinitis. Ultrasonography is an important tool in the evaluation of eyes with suspected endophthalmitis, especially those with intracapsular infection or focal infected deposits. Testing of intraocular fluid can be extremely useful but suffers from inaccessibility, poor sensitivity, and test selections dependent on a presumptive diagnosis, which may be wrong. The dilemma for clinician is to make the correct diagnosis of a rare, blinding, variegated disease quickly enough to intercede with specific therapy or to apply empiric therapy in a sufficiently skilled manner to avert disaster and confirm the diagnosis by response to treatment. When non-infectious uveitis is in the differential, empiric corticosteroids must sometimes be used, at great risk, if clinical examination, ancillary testing, and any available intraocular diagnostic tests have failed to confirm a diagnosis.",13,2012-Feb-1

Ocular extraintestinal manifestations [O-EIMs] are known complications of Crohn's disease [CD], ulcerative colitis [UC], and inflammatory bowel disease unclassified [IBD-U]. However, data on their prevalence in children are scarce and there are no clear recommendations on what follow-up should be offered. We aimed to review available data on O-EIMs in children.
METHODS: In January 2018, we performed a systematic review of published English literature using PubMed and EMBASE databases and disease-specific queries.
RESULTS: Fifteen studies [7467 patients] reported data on O-EIMs prevalence in children. Overall prevalence of O-EIMs was 0.62-1.82%. Uveitis was the most common O-EIM. Meta-analysis showed that children with CD are at increased risk of O-EIMs as compared with children with UC and IBD-U (odds ratio [OR] 2.70, 95% confidence interval [CI] 1.51-4.83). Five studies [357 patients] reported data on ophthalmological screening in asymptomatic children: mild asymptomatic uveitis was identified in a variable proportion of patients [1.06-23.1%], more frequently in male patients with CD and colonic involvement. No evidence of ocular complications from untreated uveitis was detected. A total of 23 case reports [24 patients] were identified.
CONCLUSIONS: Data on O-EIMs in children are scarce. Prevalence of O-EIMs is lower than in adults but may be underestimated because of the possibility of asymptomatic uveitis; however, the long-term significance of this condition is unknown. Children with CD may be at increased risk of O-EIMs. No recommendations on routine ophthalmological examination can be made, but a low threshold for ophthalmological referral should be maintained. Larger studies in paediatric IBD populations are needed.",13,2018-Jun-28

Juvenile idiopathic arthritis (JIA) is the most common chronic rheumatic disease and the most common systemic association of uveitis in children. JIA is subdivided into seven clinically more homogeneous subtypes, using the International League of Associations for Rheumatology (ILAR) classification system: systemic arthritis, oligoarthritis, rheumatoid factor (RF)-negative polyarthritis, RF-positive polyarthritis, psoriatic arthritis, enthesitis-related arthritis, and undifferentiated arthritis. Uveitis is very rare in patients with systemic onset JIA and in patients with juvenile-onset rheumatoid arthritis. Patients with early-onset antinuclear antibody (ANA)-positive oligoarticular JIA have the highest risk of developing chronic iridocyclitis. Ocular involvement in enthesitis-related arthritis is characterized by recurrent acute symptomatic iridocyclitis. The diagnosis and differential diagnosis of JIA are based on history, physical examination, and laboratory investigations, including complete blood count, acute-phase reactants, ANA, RF, HLA-B27, and musculoskeletal imaging studies. Recent studies have revealed distinct gene expression profiles that may be useful in the diagnosis, classification, and follow-up of JIA patients.",13,2014-Feb-1

This study provides ophthalmologists who manage uveitic glaucoma with important information on factors that can affect the success of surgical management of this challenging disease.
BACKGROUND: This study examines surgical outcomes of trabeculectomy and glaucoma device implant (GDI) surgery for uveitic glaucoma, in particular the effect of uveitis activity on surgical outcomes.
DESIGN: Retrospective chart review at a tertiary institution.
SAMPLES: Eighty-two cases with uveitic glaucoma (54 trabeculectomies and 28 (GDI) surgeries) performed between 1 December 2006 and 30 November 2014.
METHODS: Associations of factors with surgical outcomes were examined using univariate and multivariate analysis.
MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Surgical outcomes as defined in Guidelines from World Glaucoma Association.
RESULTS: Average follow up was 26.4 ± 21.5 months. Overall qualified success rate of the trabeculectomies was not statistically different from GDI, being 67% and 75%, respectively (P = 0.60). Primary and secondary GDI operations showed similar success rates. The most common postoperative complication was hypotony (~30%). Active uveitis at the time of operation was higher in trabeculectomy compared with GDI group (35% vs. 14%). Active uveitis at the time of surgery did not significantly increase risk of failure for trabeculectomies. Recurrence of uveitis was significantly associated with surgical failure in trabeculectomy group (odds ratio 4.8, P = 0.02) but not in GDI group.
CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: Surgical success rate of GDI was not significantly different from trabeculectomy for uveitic glaucoma in this study. Regular monitoring, early and prolonged intensive treatment of ocular inflammation is important for surgical success particularly following trabeculectomy.",13,2017-Jul-1

Aldose reductase, although identified initially as a glucose-reducing enzyme via polyol pathway, is believed to be an important component of antioxidant defense system as well as a key mediator of oxidative stress-induced molecular signaling. The dual role played by AR has made it a very important enzyme for the regulation of not only the cellular redox state by detoxifying the reactive lipid-aldehydes generated by lipid peroxidation which is crucial in the cellular homeostasis, but also in the regulation of molecular signaling cascade that may regulate oxidative stress-induced cytotoxic events. Search for the new molecular targets to restrain the oxidative stress-induced inflammation has resulted in the identification of AR as an unanticipated mediator of oxidative stress-induced signaling. Although, in last one decade or so AR has been implicated in various inflammation-related diseases conditions ranging from diabetes, sepsis, cancer, cardiovascular and ocular inflammation, however, a critical evaluation of the clinical efficacy of AR inhibitors awaits a better understanding of the role of AR in regulating inflammation, especially in ocular inflammation.",13,2010-Aug-1

The clinical findings and outcomes of 12 cases of luetic uveitis are reported.
METHODS: Review of clinical records.
RESULTS: Patients included 10 men and 2 women; 7 were homosexual, 9 HIV-positive. Six patients presented a medical history suggestive of syphilis. All patients presented with iritis and vitritis. Visual acuity improved in 11 patients after treatment.
CONCLUSIONS: Syphilis has reemerged in developed countries. This may be related to the post-AID S/HAART era, with a growing pool of HIV-positive men who oftenly practice unsafe sex. We underscore the importance of a high index of suspicion of ocular syphilis in patients with these characteristics.",13,2009-1-1

To describe the clinical profile of uveitis and analyze changes over a 34-year period in the frequency of different entities and demographics, anatomic data, diagnoses, and systemic associations in São Paulo, Brazil.
METHODS: A total of 1053 consecutive patients who presented for the first time at the outpatient uveitis clinic were analyzed in a prospective, observational study, conducted between July 2012 and September 2013. Age, gender, clinical characteristics, visual acuity, and clinical and etiologic diagnoses in patients with and without human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) were studied.
RESULTS: Mean age was 39.8 ± 17.8 years (56.8% female), with most between 41 and 64 years (41.79%); 10.9% of the patients were HIV-positive and 8.1% were legally blind (best-corrected visual acuity (BCVA): ≤ 20/400) at the first evaluation. The posterior, bilateral, and chronic forms of uveitis occurred most frequently and toxoplasmosis was the main cause (24.03%) but was less frequent than in 1980; the same was true for Fuchs heterochromic iridocyclitis. Syphilis, tuberculosis, Vogt-Koyanagi-Harada disease, and juvenile idiopathic arthritis-related uveitis had increased incidence rates.
CONCLUSIONS: The current results can help determine the present epidemiology of uveitis and its changes over time in Brazil and increases essential information about the disease. Many uveitic entities are curable and visual damage can be prevented or limited if treated early and appropriately.",13,2017-Jun-1

Behçet's disease is a systemic vasculitis of unknown aetiology characteristically affecting venules. Onset is typically in young adults with recurrent oral and genital ulceration, uveitis, skin manifestations, arthritis, neurological involvement, and a tendency to thrombosis. It has a worldwide distribution but is prevalent in Japan, the Middle East, and some Mediterranean countries. International diagnostic criteria have been proposed, however diagnosis can be problematical, particularly if the typical ulcers are not obvious at presentation. Treatment is challenging, must be tailored to the pattern of organ involvement for each patient and often requires combination therapies.",13,2000-Oct-1

To evaluate the effect of an intravitreally applied anti-IL-6 antibody for the treatment of experimental autoimmune uveitis (EAU).
METHODS: EAU was induced in female B10.RIII mice by Inter-Photoreceptor-Binding-Protein (IRBP) in complete Freund's adjuvant, boosted by Pertussis toxin. Single blinded intravitreal injections of anti-IL-6 antibody were applied 5-7days as well as 8-10days (3day interval) after EAU induction into the randomized treatment eye and phosphate buffered saline (PBS) into the fellow control eye. Clinical and fluorescein angiography scoring (6 EAU grades) was done at each injection day and at enucleation day 14. Enucleated eyes were either scored histologically (6 EAU grades) or examined by ELISA for levels of IL-6, IL-17 and IL-6 soluble Receptor (sIL-6R).
RESULTS: Uveitis developed in all 12 mice. Clinical uveitis score was significantly reduced (p=0.035) in treated eyes (median 2.0, range 0-4.0, n=12) compared to the fellow control eyes (median 3.0, range 1.0-4.0, n=12). Angiography scores were reduced in 9/12 treated eyes and histological scores in 3/4 treated eyes compared to the fellow control eyes. Cytokine levels were determined in 8 mice, of which 4 responded to anti-IL-6 treatment and 4 did not respond. All mice responding to treatment had a significant reduction of IL-6 (p<0.01) and IL-17 (p=0.01) levels in treated eyes compared to the fellow control eyes. This difference was not seen in non-responding mice.
CONCLUSIONS: Intravitreal anti-IL-6 treatment significantly attenuates experimental autoimmune uveitis in mice. EAU activity correlates with ocular IL-6 and IL-17 levels.",13,2017-Aug-1

Juvenile idiopathic arthritis (JIA) is the most common childhood rheumatic disease and the most prevalent systemic disorder in children with uveitis. The risk of developing uveitis is the greatest among patients with oligoarticular onset of disease. Clinical features of JIA-associated uveitis (JIAU) are nongranulomatous inflammation, anterior in location, insidious at onset, chronic course, and frequently asymptomatic in the absence of ocular structural complications. Uveitis in JIA can worsen over time with many sight-threatening complications, such as band keratopathy in the visual axis, posterior synechiae, cataract, secondary glaucoma, macular edema, hypotony, epiretinal membrane, and optic nerve edema. Different studies have pointed out that several factors are associated with poor prognosis, including young age at onset, male gender, short interval between diagnosis of arthritis and uveitis, severity of uveitis at onset, and antinuclear antibody (ANA) positivity. Although JIA associated-uveitis is still a serious blinding disease, we are at least able to identify the high-risk group.",13,2013-Dec-1

Corticosteroids constitute the first line of therapy for patients with noninfectious ocular inflammatory disease. We review factors contributing to the clinical effectiveness of various corticosteroid preparations in patients with uveitis and discuss practical aspects regarding treatment indications, when to administer various agents, and how best to dose and monitor for both treatment and adverse effects. Topically administered corticosteroids are typically indicated for the treatment of anterior uveitis, whereas periocular or intravitreal agents are employed most often in the management of intermediate or posterior intraocular inflammation. Patients with vision-threatening uveitis, bilateral inflammation, or uveitis occurring in the setting of systemic involvement may require oral or intravenous administration of corticosteroids. Noncorticosteroid immunosuppressive agents play an important role in limiting the toxic effects of long-term corticosteroid use.",13,2010-Aug-1

The inwardly rectifying potassium channel protein Kir4.1 and the water channel protein aquaporin-4 (AQP4) have been suggested to play essential roles in the potassium and water homeostasis of the retina. In this study, we investigated the expression of Kir4.1 and AQP4 in the retina during endotoxin-induced uveitis (EIU) in rats.
METHODS: EIU was induced in male Wistar rats by intravitreal injection of lipopolysaccharide (LPS). The severity of the EIU was evaluated by clinical and histopathological examination. The expression of Kir4.1 and AQP4 in the retina was detected by semiquantitative reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR), Western blotting, and immunohistochemical staining.
RESULTS: In the animal model of EIU, the clinical changes correlated well with the histopathological findings. The inflammation peaked at 24 h and resolved by seven day. After an intravitreal LPS injection, the expression of Kir4.1 in the retina showed a significant decline at both the protein and mRNA levels. In the early stages of EIU, the expression of Kir4.1 mRNA decreased sharply, reaching a minimum at 12 h (31%, p<0.001). It then increased gradually and had partially recovered 14 days after LPS injection (92%, p>0.05). The expression of Kir4.1 protein decreased significantly, reaching a minimum at three days after the LPS injection (43%, p<0.001). Thereafter, it increased slightly but was maintained at a low level until 14 days after LPS injection (64%, p<0.001). In contrast, the expression of AQP4 mRNA remained almost unchanged after LPS treatment (p>0.05). The expression of AQP4 protein was only slightly reduced at one day (82%, p>0.05) after LPS injection and then increased gradually and had nearly recovered to the basal level at 14 days after LPS injection.
CONCLUSIONS: EIU differently alters the expression of Kir4.1 and AQP4 in the retina. The differential expression of Kir4.1 and AQP4 during EIU implies a disturbance of water and potassium transport in the retina, which may contribute to the retinal edema during ocular inflammation.",13,2007-Mar-01

Uveitis is considered a rare complication of leptospirosis. This report describes an epidemic of uveitis among patients with leptospirosis and provides data, using polymerase chain reaction (PCR) amplification of Leptospira DNA, that the pathogenesis is associated with anterior chamber spirochetes. Forty-six uveitis patients, 49 uveitis controls, and 54 cataract controls were enrolled at Aravind Eye Hospital (Madurai, India). Leptospiral DNA was detected by PCR of aqueous humor; serum antibody titers were determined by ELISA and microagglutination (MAT). Thirty-seven uveitis patients (80%) demonstrated leptospiral DNA compared with 5 controls (8%; P < .001). Thirty-three uveitis patients (72%) had positive serology compared with 10 uveitis controls (20%) and 13 cataract controls (24%; P < .001). This report describes the largest cluster of patients with leptospiral uveitis and identifies six clinical characteristics that provide a diagnostic profile for leptospiral uveitis. This profile will be important for determining treatment regimens in countries where PCR and MAT are not available.",13,1998-May-1

Detection of tuberculosis as the underlying disease in uveitis can be problematic because of the limited sensitivity of conventional diagnostic methods, especially in the case of latent infection. The aim of our study was to evaluate the clinical usefulness of (18)F-fluorodeoxyglucose positron emission tomography/CT ((18)F-FDG-PET/CT) in patients with uveitis and positive interferon-γ release assay.
METHODS: We screened 95 patients with different uveitis forms by QuantiFERON TB-Gold test. Positive results were found in 24 cases. (18)F-FDG-PET/CT was performed in 20 QuantiFERON-positive patients. PET/CT images were evaluated for the presence, size and metabolic activity of hilar and mediastinal lymph nodes and pulmonary lesions.
RESULTS: In nine patients (45%) PET/CT detected increased FDG uptake in mediastinal or hilar lymph nodes. In two patients Mycobacterium tuberculosis was detected in culture after PET/CT-guided lymph node biopsy. In seven patients (35%) with serpiginous choroiditis partly calcified lymph nodes without FDG-uptake were found. Remission of uveitis was achieved in nine of 11 (82%) anti-tuberculosis-treated patients with progressive course of uveitis.
CONCLUSION: In QuantiFERON-positive patients with severe uveitis forms, such as serpiginous choroiditis and occlusive retinal vasculitis, (18)F-FDG-PET/CT is useful to identify lesions appropriate for biopsy and helps to establish the diagnosis and appropriate therapy for presumed tuberculosis-induced intraocular inflammation.",13,2011-Sep-1

Uveitis is an inflammatory process that initially starts in the uvea, but can also affect other adjacent eye structures, and is currently the fourth cause of blindness in developed countries. Corticoids are probably the most widespread treatment, but resorting to other immunosuppressive treatments is a frequent practice. Since the implication of different cytokines in uveitis has been well demonstrated, the majority of recent treatments for this disease include inhibitors or antibodies against these. Nevertheless, adequate treatment for each uveitis type entails a difficult therapeutic decision as no clear recommendations are found in the literature, despite the few protocolized clinical assays and many case-control studies done. This review aims to present, in order, the mechanisms and main indications of the most modern immunosuppressive drugs against cytokines.",13,2015-Aug-11

The distribution of uveitis varies with genetic, ethnic, geographic, environmental, and lifestyle factors. Epidemiological information about the patterns of uveitis is useful when an ophthalmologist considers the diagnosis of uveitis. Therefore, it is important to identify the causes of uveitis over the years in different regions. The purposes of this study were to characterize the uveitis patients who first arrived at the University of Tokyo Hospital in 2013-2015, and to analyze the changes in the patterns of uveitis from 2004 to 2012 to 2013-2015.
METHODS: We retrospectively identified 750 newly arrived patients with uveitis who visited the Uveitis Clinic in the University of Tokyo Hospital between January 2013 and December 2015, using clinical records. We extracted data on patient age, sex, diagnosis, anatomic location of inflammation, laboratory test results of blood and urine, and chest X-ray and fluorescein fundus angiography findings for each patient. In addition, we compared these data with those from 2004 to 2012 to analyze the changes in the patterns of uveitis.
RESULTS: A definite diagnosis was established in 445 patients (59.3%). The most common diagnoses were herpetic iridocyclitis (7.5%), sarcoidosis (6.1%), Behçet's disease (4.4%), Vogt-Koyanagi-Harada disease (4.1%), and intraocular lymphoma (4.1%). The most frequent unclassified type of uveitis was suspected sarcoidosis (22.3%). Analysis of the changes in the patterns of uveitis in the central Tokyo area from 2004 to 2012 to 2013-2015 revealed notable increasing trends of herpetic iridocyclitis and intraocular lymphoma, and increasing trends of bacterial endophthalmitis, fungal endophthalmitis, and juvenile chronic iridocyclitis. In contrast, the frequency of sarcoidosis, Behçet's disease, and Vogt-Koyanagi-Harada disease decreased.
CONCLUSIONS: The patterns of uveitis changed considerably from 2004 to 2012 to 2013-2015. Continuous investigations about the epidemiology of uveitis are needed to diagnose uveitis more accurately.",13,2018-Aug-02

To assess the safety and efficacy of intravitreal dexamethasone implants in the treatment of macular edema secondary to infectious uveitis.
METHODS: We retrospectively reviewed clinical records from three uveitis referral units in Spain. The main outcome measures were rate of reactivation of infection, improvements in visual acuity and resolution of macular edema, as measured by optical coherence tomography.
RESULTS: We included eight eyes from seven patients with a median age of 64 years (30-75). Etiologies of the infections were Herpes simplex virus-type 1, Varicela-Zoster virus, Treponema pallidum, Brucella mellitensis, Borrelia burgdorferi, Toxoplasma gondii, and cytomegalovirus. Median visual acuity was 20/160 (20/30-20/400) at baseline and 20/70 (20/25-20/200) at the last follow-up visit. Mean macular thickness was 516 μm (115) at baseline and 266.3 μm (40) at the last follow-up visit. Visual acuity improved in 100% of the eyes and none of the eyes showed macular edema at the last follow-up visit. Five patients required reinjections of the implant. Only one patient required antiglaucoma drops for a temporary increase in ocular pressure. There were no cases of reactivation of the infectious ocular disease. Median follow-up time was 18 months.
CONCLUSION: In this small case series of eyes with macular edema secondary to infectious uveitis, treatment with dexamethasone intravitreal implants was not associated with reactivation of the infectious ocular disease. Furthermore, significant improvements in visual acuity and macular thickness were observed in our patients.",13,2016-Sep-1

TLR4 activation by LPS (endotoxin) is mediated by the MyD88 and TRIF intracellular signaling pathways. We determined the relative activation of these pathways in murine ocular tissue after LPS exposure. Additionally, we explored whether BM-derived or non-BM-derived cells were the major contributors to EIU. Mice deficient in TRIF or MyD88 and their congenic (WT) controls received 250 ng ultrapure LPS ivt at 0 h. Ocular inflammation was assessed by histological analysis at 4, 6, and 24 h, and additionally, in MyD88(-/-) mice, intravital microscopy was performed at 4 h and 6 h to assess adherent, rolling, and infiltrating cells in the iris vasculature and tissue. Cytokines associated with the MyD88 and TRIF intracellular signaling pathways were analyzed in ocular tissue at 4 h. BM chimeric mice (WT→WT, TLR4(-/-)→WT, WT→TLR4(-/-)) received 250 ng LPS by ivt injection, and ocular tissues were examined by histology at 6 h. Lack of MyD88 resulted in a markedly diminished cellular response and reduced production of MyD88-related cytokines 4 h post-LPS treatment. In contrast, lack of TRIF led to reduced production of TRIF-related cytokines and no change in the cellular response to LPS. Therefore, the MyD88 pathway appears to be the dominant TLR4 pathway in EIU. Only WT → TLR4(-/-) chimeric mice were resistant to EIU, and this suggests, surprisingly, that non-BM-derived (radiation-resistant) cells in the eye play a greater role than BM-derived cells.",13,2011-Aug-1

One hundred twelve patients with vitiligo were examined for ocular abnormalities. Discrete areas of depigmentation with associated pigment hyperplasia clinically appearing to involve the choroid and retinal pigment epithelium were observed in 44 patients, and active uveitis was seen in nine patients. The changes observed suggest that the spectrum of diseases that includes Harada's disease and the Vogt-Koyanagi syndrome may be broader than previously appreciated. Patients with these syndromes may represent the most severe examples of vitiligo and uveal inflammation. The occurrence of symptoms of night blindness in 12 patients and a family history of retinitis pigmentosa in two of these may signify a possible malfunction of the retinal pigment epithelium. Further evidence for a pigment epithelium disorder is suggested by the high incidence of an unusually prominent choroidal pattern in these patients.",13,1979-Jun-1

To measure changes in the choroidal vascularity index (CVI) in chronic Vogt-Koyanagi-Harada (VKH) disease during a recurrent anterior uveitis attack.
METHODS: Forty VKH patients and 40 normal controls were included in this study. Choroidal images were recorded before and during a recurrent anterior uveitis attack, as well as after appropriate treatment. CVI was measured by the binarization technique using ImageJ software (Bethesda, MD).
RESULTS: The CVI was 0.75 ± 0.09 in quiescent VKH patients, which was significantly higher compared to healthy controls (0.70 ± 0.05, p ＜ 0.0001). The CVI significantly decreased to 0.72 ± 0.09 when granulomatous anterior uveitis appeared in these patients. However, it returned to 0.75 ± 0.08 after uveitis resolved.
CONCLUSIONS: A significant decrease of the CVI occurred during recurrent anterior uveitis in chronic VKH. CVI may provide a novel parameter to guide the treatment of VKH disease.",13,2018-1-1

Resident and infiltrated macrophages play relevant roles in uveitis as effectors of innate immunity and inductors of acquired immunity. They are major effectors of tissue damage in uveitis and are also considered to be potent antigen-presenting cells. In the last few years, experimental animal models of uveitis have enabled us to enhance our understanding of the leading role of macrophages in eye inflammation processes, including macrophage polarization in experimental autoimmune uveoretinitis and the major role of Toll-like receptor 4 in endotoxin-induced uveitis. This improved knowledge should guide advantageous iterative research to establish mechanisms and possible therapeutic targets for human uveitis resolution.",13,2015-1-1

JIA-associated uveitis (JIAU) is a serious, sight-threatening disease with significant long-term complications and risk of blindness, even with improved contemporary treatments. The MIWGUC was set up in order to propose specific JIAU activity and response items and to validate their applicability for clinical outcome studies.
METHODS: The group consists of 8 paediatric rheumatologists and 7 ophthalmologists. A consensus meeting took place on November 2015 in Barcelona (Spain) with the objective of validating the previously proposed measures. The validation process was based on the results of a prospective open, international, multi-centre, cohort study designed to validate the outcome measures proposed by the initial MIWGUC group meeting in 2012. The meeting used the same Delphi and nominal group technique as previously described in the first paper from the MIWGUC group (Arthritis Care Res 64:1365-72, 2012). Patients were included with a diagnosis of JIA, aged less than 18 years, and with active uveitis or an uveitis flare which required treatment with a disease-modifying anti-rheumatic drug. The proposed outcome measures for uveitis were collected by an ophthalmologist and for arthritis by a paediatric rheumatologist. Patient reported outcome measures were also measured.
RESULTS: A total of 82 patients were enrolled into the validation cohort. Fifty four percent (n = 44) had persistent oligoarthritis followed by rheumatoid factor negative polyarthritis (n = 15, 18%). The mean uveitis disease duration was 3.3 years (SD 3.0). Bilateral eye involvement was reported in 65 (79.3%) patients. The main findings are that the most significant changes, from baseline to 6 months, are found in the AC activity measures of cells and flare. These measures correlate with the presence of pre-existing structural complications and this has implications for the reporting of trials using a single measure as a primary outcome. We also found that visual analogue scales of disease activity showed significant change when reported by the ophthalmologist, rheumatologist and families. The measures formed three relatively distinct groups. The first group of measures comprised uveitis activity, ocular damage and the ophthalmologists' VAS. The second comprised patient reported outcomes including disruption to school attendance. The third group consisted of the rheumatologists' VAS and the joint score.
CONCLUSIONS: We propose distinctive and clinically significant measures of disease activity, severity and damage for JIAU. This effort is the initial step for developing a comprehensive outcome measures for JIAU, which incorporates the perspectives of rheumatologists, ophthalmologists, patients and families.",13,2019-Oct-01

To determine the clinical features of patients with uveitis with biopsy-proven sarcoidosis, document differences in these features according to ethnicity, age and sex, and assess the diagnostic value of biochemical and imaging examinations.
METHODS: Retrospective study of 83 biopsy-proven sarcoid uveitis cases seen at two Departments of Internal Medicine and two Departments of Ophthalmology between April 2004 and March 2014.
RESULTS: Caucasian patients presented with uveitis at a later age than non-Caucasian (58 years vs 41 years; p=0.001) and had more often a chronic form (78.3% vs 43.8%; p=0.01). Women had higher rates of chronic macular oedema than men (48.3% vs 14.3%; p=0.01). There were no statistically significant differences between patients aged ≤50 years and patients aged >50 years. ACE levels were high (>62 U/L) in 61.7% and lysozyme levels high (>16.7 mg/L) in 83.9% of tested patients. Chest X-rays and CTs were suggestive of sarcoidosis in 62.8% and 91.2% of cases, respectively. Among 21 patients with positive tomography and negative X-rays, 13 were Caucasian women >50 years. Endoscopic ultrasound-guided fine-needle aspiration of intrathoracic nodes contributed to the diagnosis in 7 patients with normal labial salivary gland and transbronchial biopsies. Any of the enzyme tests together with any of the imaging tests identified 100% of the patients.
CONCLUSIONS: In this largest European series of biopsy-proven sarcoidosis to date, the outstanding diagnostic ability of enzyme test plus imaging test couple suggests that the recourse to invasive procedures should be limited to patients with ocular involvement that would justify systemic treatments.",13,2015-Oct-1

To assess efficacy, safety, and cost-effectiveness of adalimumab (ADA) therapy optimization in a large series of patients with uveitis due to Behçet disease (BD) who achieved remission after the use of this biologic agent.
DESIGN: Open-label multicenter study of ADA-treated patients with BD uveitis refractory to conventional immunosuppressants.
SUBJECTS: Sixty-five of 74 patients with uveitis due to BD, who achieved remission after a median ADA duration of 6 (range, 3-12) months. ADA was optimized in 23 (35.4%) of them. This biologic agent was maintained at a dose of 40 mg/subcutaneously/2 weeks in the remaining 42 patients.
METHODS: After remission, based on a shared decision between the patient and the treating physician, ADA was optimized. When agreement between patient and physician was reached, optimization was performed by prolonging the ADA dosing interval progressively. Comparison between optimized and nonoptimized patients was performed.
MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Efficacy, safety, and cost-effectiveness in optimized and nonoptimized groups. To determine efficacy, intraocular inflammation (anterior chamber cells, vitritis, and retinal vasculitis), macular thickness, visual acuity, and the sparing effect of glucocorticoids were assessed.
RESULTS: No demographic or ocular differences were found at the time of ADA onset between the optimized and the nonoptimized groups. Most ocular outcomes were similar after a mean ± standard deviation follow-up of 34.7±13.3 and 26±21.3 months in the optimized and nonoptimized groups, respectively. However, relevant adverse effects were only seen in the nonoptimized group (lymphoma, pneumonia, severe local reaction at the injection site, and bacteremia by Escherichia coli, 1 each). Moreover, the mean ADA treatment costs were lower in the optimized group than in the nonoptimized group (6101.25 euros/patient/year vs. 12 339.48; P < 0.01).
CONCLUSION: ADA optimization in BD uveitis refractory to conventional therapy is effective, safe, and cost-effective.",13,2018-Sep-1

To determine if a high-fat diet (HFD) induces meibomian gland (MG) inflammation in mice.
METHODS: Male C57BL/6J mice were fed a standard diet (SD), HFD, or HFD supplemented with the peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor gamma (PPAR-γ) agonist rosiglitazone for various durations. Body weight, blood lipid levels, and eyelid changes were monitored at regular intervals. MG sections were subjected to hematoxylin and eosin staining, LipidTox staining, TUNEL assay, and immunostaining. Quantitative RT-PCR and western blot analyses were performed to detect relative gene expression and signaling pathway activation in MGs.
RESULTS: MG acinus accumulated more lipids in the mice fed the HFD. Periglandular CD45-positive and F4/80-positive cell infiltration were more evident in the HFD mice, and they were accompanied by upregulation of inflammation-related cytokines. PPAR-γ downregulation accompanied activation of the mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) and nuclear factor kappa B (NF-κB) signaling pathways in the HFD mice. There was increased acini cell apoptosis and mitochondria damage in mice fed the HFD. MG inflammation was ameliorated following a shift to the standard diet and rosiglitazone treatment in the mice fed the HFD.
CONCLUSIONS: HFD-induced declines in PPAR-γ expression and MAPK and NF-κB signaling pathway activation resulted in MG inflammation and dysfunction in mice.",13,2021-Aug-02

To assess the extended efficacy and safety of suprachoroidal triamcinolone acetonide injectable suspension (CLS-TA) among patients with macular oedema (ME) secondary to non-infectious uveitis (NIU).
METHODS: Patients with uveitic ME were treated with suprachoroidal CLS-TA at baseline and week 12 of the Efficacy and Safety of Suprachoroidal CLS-TA for Macular Edema Secondary to Noninfectious Uveitis: Phase 3 Randomized Trial (PEACHTREE) study. Time to rescue was evaluated over 24 additional weeks for MAGNOLIA. Safety data, visual acuity and retinal central subfield thickness (CST) reduction were also evaluated. Of the 53 eligible patients (46 CLS-TA and 7 control), 33 patients were enrolled (28 CLS-TA and 5 control).
RESULTS: Over the entire 48-week period for PEACHTREE and MAGNOLIA, the median time to rescue therapy was 257 days versus 55.5 days for the CLS-TA and sham-control arms, respectively. Of 28 CLS-TA treated patients who participated in MAGNOLIA, 14 (50%) did not require rescue therapy through approximately 9 months after the second treatment. Among CLS-TA patients not requiring rescue, there was a mean gain of 12.1 letters and mean CST reduction of 174.5 µm at week 48. No serious adverse events related to study treatment were observed.
CONCLUSION: Approximately 50% of patients did not require additional treatment for up to 9 months following the last CLS-TA administration.",13,2022-Aug-1

The chapter is a review enclosed in the volume ""Glaucoma: A pancitopatia of the retina and beyond."" No cure exists for glaucoma. Knowledge on the molecular and cellular alterations underlying glaucoma neurodegeneration (GL-ND) includes innovative and path-breaking research on neuroinflammation and neuroprotection. A series of events involving immune response (IR), oxidative stress and gene expression are occurring during the glaucoma course. Uveitic glaucoma (UG) is a prevalent acute/chronic complication, in the setting of chronic anterior chamber inflammation. Managing the disease requires a team approach to guarantee better results for eyes and vision. Advances in biomedicine/biotechnology are driving a tremendous revolution in ophthalmology and ophthalmic research. New diagnostic and imaging modalities, constantly refined, enable outstanding criteria for delimiting glaucomatous neurodegeneration. Moreover, biotherapies that may modulate or inhibit the IR must be considered among the first-line for glaucoma neuroprotection. This review offers the readers useful and practical information on the latest updates in this regard.",13,2020-1-1

Ocular complications of herpes zoster ophthalmicus (HZO) may lead to substantial visual disability, severe post-herpetic neuralgia and rarely fatal cerebral complications.
AIM: To identify the pattern of ocular manifestation in herpes zoster ophthalmicus.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: A cross-sectional descriptive study was under taken including the clinically diagnosed cases of HZO. All of them underwent a complete ophthalmological evaluation.
RESULTS: Sixty-eight cases of HZO were examined, of which 37 (54.4 %) were male and 31 (45.6%) female. The mean age was 48.7 ± 18.5 years. Most of the patients (64.7 %) were above the age of 40 years. 77.94 % of the patients had some form of ocular involvement. Pain (77.9 %) was the commonest ocular complaint. In young patients less than 35 years, HIV was the most common risk factor (19.3 %).Visual status was good in the majority (73.5 %) of patients at presentation. Lid and adnexal findings (45.8 %) were most common ocular involvement followed by conjunctivitis (41.1 %). Corneal complication was seen in 38.2 % of cases, uveitis in 19.1 % and post-herpetic neuralgia (PHN) and secondary glaucoma each in 5.8 %.
CONCLUSION: Eyelid and ocular adnexal involvement is most commonly found in patients with herpes zoster ophthalmicus followed by corneal complication and uveitis. There needs to be awareness of ocular involvement, which can be sight threatening, among the HZO patients and other medical departments and an increased emphasis on regular ophthalmic examination.",12,2011-1-1

There are roughly 5 to 10 million persons infected with human T-lymphotropic virus type 1 (HTLV-1) worldwide, and the safety of treating this population with biologics remains poorly understood.
PATIENT CONCERNS AND DIAGNOSIS: An HTLV-1-infected 66-year-old female with HTLV-1 uveitis (HU) and HTLV-1-associated myelopathy/tropical spastic paraparesis (HAM/TSP). Her HU had been in remission and her HAM/TSP symptoms had been managed effectively with oral steroids for years. However, she developed severe rheumatoid arthritis (RA) after failing to respond well to conventional anti-rheumatic agents.
INTERVENTIONS: She was administered two intravenous 8mg/kg doses of the biologic tocilizumab.
OUTCOMES: Subsequently, her RA symptoms resolved, but she suffered a recurrence of HU and exacerbation of HAM/TSP symptoms. When she was switched back to steroid-based treatment, HU and HAM symptoms both improved, but RA symptoms again worsened. Finally, an attempt to substitute the biologic abatacept and reduce the steroids failed when HAM/TSP symptoms again became aggravated.
LESSONS: To the best of our knowledge, this represents the first report worldwide of a biologic aggravating HTLV-1-associated conditions. This report suggests that caution is advised when using biologics to treat HTLV-1-infected patients, though further research is required to clarify the situation.",12,2017-Feb-1

To examine the results of pars plana vitrectomy for cystoid macular edema secondary to sarcoid uveitis resistant to medical treatment.
DESIGN: Retrospective, interventional, noncomparative case series.
SUBJECTS: Fourteen consecutive subjects (18 eyes) with cystoid macular edema associated with sarcoid uveitis resistant to medical treatment.
INTERVENTION: All eyes underwent pars plana vitrectomy. Nine eyes also underwent peeling of the epiretinal membrane or removal of the posterior vitreous cortex.
MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Status of macular edema, visual acuity, and complications.
RESULTS: Ten eyes (56%) improved 2 or more lines of Snellen visual acuity within 12 months. Six eyes (33%) remained unchanged, within a line of preoperative Snellen visual acuity, and two eyes (11%) worsened by 2 or more lines of Snellen visual acuity. Slit-lamp biomicroscopy showed that cystoid macular edema had resolved in 14 eyes (78%) within 9 months postoperatively. One eye (6%) had minimal edema, whereas three eyes (17%) remained unchanged biomicroscopically at the final visit. Postoperative complications included cataract formation, glaucoma, optic nerve atrophy, epiretinal membrane formation, and tractional retinal detachment. No severe postoperative inflammation was noted.
CONCLUSIONS: Pars plana vitrectomy seems to have a beneficial effect on cystoid macular edema caused by sarcoidosis resistant to medical treatment.",12,2001-Jun-1

This study aimed to report the clinical outcome of children with uveitis treated with anti-tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNF-α) agents.
METHODS: This included a retrospective cohort study. Children with uveitis treated with infliximab or adalimumab in 2008-2014 at five dedicated uveitis clinics were identified by database search. Their medical records were reviewed for demographic data, clinical presentation, ocular complications, and visual outcome. Systemic side effects and the steroid-sparing effect of treatment were documented.
RESULTS: The cohort included 24 patients (43 eyes) of whom 14 received infliximab and 10 received adalimumab after failing conventional immunosuppression therapy. Mean age was 9.3 ± 4.0 years. The most common diagnosis was juvenile idiopathic arthritis-related uveitis (n = 10), followed by Behçet's disease (n = 4), sarcoidosis (n = 1), and ankylosing spondylitis (n = 1); eight had idiopathic uveitis. Ocular manifestations included panuveitis in 20 eyes (46.5%), chronic anterior uveitis in 19 (44.2%), and intermediate uveitis in 4 (9.3%). The duration of biologic treatment ranged from 6 to 72 months. During the 12 months prior to biologic treatment, while on conventional immunosuppressive therapy, mean visual acuity deteriorated from 0.22 to 0.45 logMAR, with a trend of recovery to 0.25 at 3 months after initiation of biologic treatment, remaining stable thereafter. A full corticosteroid-sparing effect was demonstrated in 16 of the 19 patients (84.2%) for whom data were available. Treatment was well tolerated.
CONCLUSIONS: Treatment of pediatric uveitis with anti-TNF-α agents may improve outcome while providing steroid-sparing effect, when conventional immunosuppression fails. The role of anti-TNF-α agents as first-line treatment should be further investigated in controlled prospective clinical trials.",12,2018-Apr-1

Infectious causes of uveitis are common in the developing world and include some causes that are rarely encountered in industrialized nations, such as tuberculosis, leptospirosis, leprosy, onchocerciasis, and cystercicosis. Ocular toxoplasmosis occurs in all countries but is more common in Central and South America, the South Pacific, and western Europe. AIDS-related opportunistic infections occur wherever HIV infection is prevalent, including North and South America, western and eastern Europe, the former Soviet Union, sub-Saharan Africa, and South and Southeast Asia. Physicians who care for patients in the developing world should consider these infectious possibilities whenever their patients develop uveitis.",12,2000-1-1

To analyze the profile, etiology, complications, medical and surgical management, and visual outcome among pediatric uveitis patients seen at a referral uveitis clinic in India.
DESIGN: Retrospective cohort study, tertiary hospital setting.
METHODS: Records between January 2007 and April 2010 were reviewed for patients with uveitis who were 0-18 years of age. Uveitis diagnosis was based on SUN criteria; complications, medical and surgical management, and visual outcome were evaluated.
RESULTS: Among 190 children with uveitis, 64.2% were boys and 112 had unilateral disease. The median age at presentation was 11 years. Ninety-nine (52%) had anterior, 49 (26%) intermediate, 27 (14%) posterior, and 15 (7.9%) panuveitis. Infectious uveitis was present in 44 patients, of which 21 cases (48%) were posterior uveitis. Parasitic, tuberculous, and viral infectious uveitis was encountered. A total of 174 patients were followed over 315.5 person-years (median = 1.35 years). Seventy-seven (40.5%) children had complications related to uveitis. Forty-six out of 77 complications noted were complicated cataracts. Surgical procedures were done in 46.9% (15%/100 person-years). The visual acuity improved by two Snellen lines in the uveitic eyes, following therapy in 120 children, was stable in 40 children, and worsened in 14 children. Follow-up visual acuity was missing for 16 children.
CONCLUSION: A large proportion of pediatric uveitis cases experienced complications of uveitis, mostly prior to presentation for subspecialty management. These often required surgical management, most commonly to clear the visual axis of cataract for visual rehabilitation and to prevent amblyopia. In most cases, tertiary management was associated with visual improvement. The results suggest that subspecialty management can result in improvement of the clinical course of pediatric uveitis.",12,2016-Aug-1

PMID: 33845011
The purpose of this study was to determine classification criteria for punctate inner choroiditis (PIC).
DESIGN: Machine learning of cases with PIC and 8 other posterior uveitides.
METHODS: Cases of posterior uveitides were collected in an informatics-designed preliminary database, and a final database was constructed of cases achieving supermajority agreement on diagnosis by using formal consensus techniques. Cases were split into a training set and a validation set. Machine learning using multinomial logistic regression was used in the training set to determine a parsimonious set of criteria that minimized the misclassification rate among the posterior uveitides. The resulting criteria were evaluated in the validation set.
RESULTS: A total of 1,068 cases of posterior uveitides, including 144 cases of PIC, were evaluated by machine learning. Key criteria for PIC included: 1) ""punctate""-appearing choroidal spots <250 µm in diameter; 2) absent to minimal anterior chamber and vitreous inflammation; and 3) involvement of the posterior pole with or without mid-periphery. Overall accuracy for posterior uveitides was 93.9% in the training set and 98.0% (95% confidence interval: 94.3-99.3) in the validation set. The misclassification rates for PIC were 15% in the training set and 9% in the validation set.
CONCLUSIONS: The criteria for PIC had a reasonably low misclassification rate and appeared to perform sufficiently well for use in clinical and translational research.",12,2021-Aug-1

Electronic health record (EHR) systems based on International Statistical Classification of Diseases and Related Health Problems, Tenth Revision (ICD-10) coding of disease entities are increasingly being used to generate large data sets for analysis. However, the reproducibility of ICD-10 coding in uveitis has not been assessed across EHR platforms, and imprecision in coding may lead to improper conclusions in big-data analyses.
OBJECTIVE: To compare ICD-10 coding of uveitis using 2 EHR systems.
DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: This study compares ICD-10 codes for 27 uveitic diseases generated by the Epic and MDIntelleSys EHR systems to the ICD-10 descriptions associated with the codes. No patient data were assessed in this study.
MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: The number of diseases for which ICD-10 coding differed between the 2 systems.
RESULTS: Thirteen of 27 uveitic diseases were coded differently by the 2 EHR systems. Coding imprecision was notable in that the Epic system returned 16 ICD-10 codes and the MDIntelleSys returned 12 ICD-10 codes to describe 13 diseases; 4 diseases had multiple codes returned, and 6 codes were used to describe more than 1 disease. For example, MDIntelleSys uses ICD-10 code H30.13 for both birdshot choroiditis and acute retinal necrosis, while Epic uses H30.9 for both birdshot choroiditis and multiple evanescent white dot syndrome; MDIntelleSys uses this code for multifocal choroiditis. Furthermore, the ICD-10 descriptions for certain codes lack specificity, allowing variable interpretation by the coder.
CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: This study suggests there is substantial disparity in the ICD-10 codes that are generated for specific uveitides by the 2 EHR systems studied. This result implies that analysis of large databases generated from the pooling of EHR data could produce results with substantial bias because of misclassification resulting from conflicting and imprecise coding of uveitides. Therefore, research into outcomes, costs, health care utilization, and epidemiology in uveitis might be improved if a more uniform coding system to describe ocular inflammatory disease is implemented.",12,2018-Oct-01

To investigate the role of mast cells and annexin-A1 (Anxa1) in endotoxin-induced uveitis (EIU).
METHODS: EIU was induced by injection of lipopolysaccharide (LPS) into the paws of rats, which were then sacrificed after 24 and 48 h. To assess EIU in the absence of mast cells, groups of animals were pretreated with compound 48/80 (c48/80) and sacrificed after 24 h after no treatment or EIU induction. The eyes were used for histological studies and the aqueous humor (AqH) pool was used for the analysis of transmigrated cells and Anxa1 levels. In inflammatory cells, Anxa1 expression was monitored by immunohistochemistry.
RESULTS: After 24 h, rats with EIU exhibited degranulated mast cells, associated with elevated numbers of infiltrating leukocytes and the high expression of Anxa1 in the AqH and the neutrophils. After 48 h of EIU, the mast cells were intact, indicating granule re-synthesis, and there was a reduction of neutrophil transmigration and an increase in the number of mononuclear phagocytic cells in ocular tissues. Anxa1 expression was decreased in neutrophils but increased in mononuclear phagocytic cells. In the animals pretreated with c48/80 and subjected to EIU, mast cells responded to this secretagogue by degranulating and few transmigrated neutrophils were observed. CONCLUSTIONS: We report that mast cells are a potential source of pharmacological mediators that are strongly linked to the pathophysiology of EIU, and the endogenous protein Anxa1 is a mediator in the homeostasis of the inflammatory process with anti-migratory effects on leukocytes, which supports further studies of this protein as an innovative therapy for uveitis.",12,2011-1-1

Ocular inflammation is one of the leading causes of blindness worldwide, and steroids in topical ophthalmic solutions (e.g. dexamethasone eye drops) are the mainstay of therapy for ocular inflammation. For many non-infectious ocular inflammatory diseases, such as uveitis, eye drops are administered as often as once every hour. The high frequency of administration coupled with the side effects of eye drops leads to poor adherence for patients. Drug-eluting contact lenses have long been sought as a potentially superior alternative for sustained ocular drug delivery; but loading sufficient drug into contact lenses and control the release of the drug is still a challenge. A dexamethasone releasing contact lens (Dex-Lens) was previously developed by encapsulating a dexamethasone-polymer film within the periphery of a hydrogel-based contact lens. Here, we demonstrate safety and efficacy of the Dex-Lens in rabbit models in the treatment of anterior ocular inflammation. The Dex-Lens delivered drug for 7 days in vivo (rabbit model). In an ocular irritation study (Draize test) with Dex-Lens extracts, no adverse events were observed in normal rabbit eyes. Dex-Lenses effectively inhibited suture-induced corneal neovascularization and inflammation for 7 days and lipopolysaccharide-induced anterior uveitis for 5 days. The efficacy of Dex-Lenses was similar to that of hourly-administered dexamethasone eye drops. In the corneal neovascularization study, substantial corneal edema was observed in rabbit eyes that received no treatment and those that wore a vehicle lens as compared to rabbit eyes that wore the Dex-Lens. Throughout these studies, Dex-Lenses were well tolerated and did not exhibit signs of toxicity. Dexamethasone-eluting contact lenses may be an option for the treatment of ocular inflammation and a platform for ocular drug delivery. STATEMENT OF SIGNIFICANCE: Inflammation of the eye can happen either on the ocular surface (i.e. the cornea) or inside the eye, both of which can result in loss of vision or even blindness. Ocular inflammation is normally treated by steroid eye drops. Depending on the type and severity of inflammation, patients may have to take drops every hour for days at a time. Such severe dosing regimen can lead to patients missing doses. Also, more than 95% drug in an eye drop never goes inside the eye. Here we present a contact lens that release a steroid (dexamethasone) for seven days at a time. It is much more efficient than eye drops and a significant improvement since once worn, the patient will avoid missing doses.",12,2020-Oct-15

In addition to the inhibition of xanthine oxidase, allopurinol is known to act, dependent on the dose, as a free radical scavenger, an antioxidant, and a ""scavenger"" of hypochlorous acid. This activity was investigated using a model of lens-induced uveitis.
METHODS: Lipid peroxides (LPO) were determined in aqueous humor and in retinal tissue. Reduced and oxidized glutathione (GSH and GSSG) of the aqueous humor and myeloperoxidase (MPO) activity in the iris-ciliary body complex were analyzed. Allopurinol and oxypurinol concentrations were determined by high-performance liquid chromatography in aqueous humor and retinal tissue of both control eyes and eyes with uveitis. These measurements were performed 6 hours after intravenous application of allopurinol.
RESULTS: In lens-induced uveitis, LPO are significantly elevated, GSH is reduced, and GSSG and MPO are increased. A xanthine oxidase inhibition dose (< 10 mg/kg body weight) of allopurinol showed no effects on oxidative tissue damage in the model used in this study. Higher doses, however, were able to reduce the oxidative damage. Allopurinol (20 mg/kg body weight) had slight effects on GSH and GSSG. All parameters improved using a dose of 50 mg/kg body weight; a dose of 100 mg/kg body weight only showed additional improvement in GSH and GSSG. There was no further change in the other parameters. Allopurinol and oxypurinol concentrations in aqueous humor and retinal tissue showed a dose dependency reaching scavenger concentrations after application of 50 mg/kg body weight of allopurinol.
CONCLUSIONS: These results suggest that the xanthine oxidase mechanism plays a minor role in the oxidative tissue damage due to lens-induced uveitis. Free radicals and oxidants are generated by activated leukocytes; therefore, the effect of higher doses of allopurinol is due to its free radical scavenging and antioxidative activity.",12,1994-Oct-1

Cystoid macular edema (CME) is a common vision-limiting complication of uveitis. This study correlated fundus autofluorescence (FAF) and optical coherence tomography (OCT) with visual acuity (VA).
PATIENTS AND METHODS: Prospective, observational, cross-sectional study with 31 patients (53 eyes) with endogenous uveitis and fluorescein angiographically (FA) confirmed CME. Foveal thickness, epiretinal membrane formation, and altered (increased or decreased) foveal FAF were analyzed with a combined spectral domain OCT/FA device (Spectralis/HRA Heidelberg Retina Angiograph 2). Primary outcome measures were an association between central FAF with foveal thickness and VA (t-test, each). Secondary outcome measures included the association of FAF and epiretinal membrane formation, the presence of cystoid spaces in the outer plexiform and inner nuclear layers, and integrity of the third highly reflective band as detected by OCT (Fisher s exact test, each).
RESULTS: Of the 24 eyes (59%) with altered FAF in the central 500 microm, all had increased foveal FAF, and 10% also had increased perifoveal petaloid FAF. In eyes with altered FAF, the VA was frequently worse (p = 0.019) and foveal thickness increased (p = 0.015). Foveal thickness (mean 369.4 mum) correlated with VA (p < 0.01). FAF alterations correlated with the presence of cystoid spaces in the outer plexiform and inner nuclear layer in OCT (p < 0.001). Epiretinal membrane formation (70%) was associated with increased foveal thickness (p = 0.003) and poor VA (p = 0.08). Irregularity or loss of the third HRB (51%) correlated with poor VA (p < 0.01) and altered central FAF (p = 0.031).
CONCLUSIONS: FAF and OCT are useful diagnostic tools for the evaluation of uveitic CME. Increased central FAF, presence of cystoid retinal changes and disrupted third highly reflective band in OCT, and epiretinal membrane formation are associated with poor vision.",12,2009-Dec-1

Statistical correlations between the expression of various HLA antigens and certain autoimmune diseases have been observed for both HLA class I and II antigens. Autoimmune diseases like spondyloarthropathies and anterior uveitis are associated with HLA-B27, but uveitis in Behçet's disease with HLA-B51. We describe a peptide from disease-associated HLA class I antigens sharing sequence homologies with a highly uveitogenic epitope from the retinal autoantigen S-antigen. S-antigen induces autoimmune uveitis in the animal model and is a major autoantigen in human disease. The HLA peptide induced uveitis in the Lewis rat and, moreover, suppressed S-antigen-induced disease when administered orally. Patients' PBL cross-reacted with the HLA- and corresponding retinal peptide, explaining the organ specificity of the disease.",12,1994-Nov-1

This case series highlights the risk of uveitis in patients treated with vemurafenib for unresectable or metastatic cutaneous melanoma.
OBJECTIVE: To assess the occurrence and severity of uveitis as an adverse effect of vemurafenib therapy.
DESIGN, SETTING, AND PATIENTS: In this observational small case series, data were collected successively from May 1, 2012, through February 31, 2013, from patients with clinical signs of ocular inflammation treated with vemurafenib at the Department of Ophthalmology, Cochin-Hôtel-Dieu Hospital.
MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: Patients' demographics, vemurafenib dosages, and the intervals between the onset of treatment and the first ocular symptoms were recorded. The characteristics of ocular inflammatory manifestations were analyzed. The effect of the discontinuation of vemurafenib therapy on ocular manifestations was assessed, as well as the effect of rechallenging when vemurafenib was reintroduced.
RESULTS: Seven patients (mean [SD] age, 74.7 [4.0] years) had uveitis. The vemurafenib dose was 960 mg twice per day in 6 patients and a half dose in 1 patient. The mean (SD) time until the appearance of ocular signs was 5.6 (2.3) months (range, 19 days to 7 months), and inflammation ranged from mild or low-grade anterior uveitis to severe explosive panuveitis complicated by retinal detachment. Signs of ocular inflammation were always bilateral. Optical coherence tomography revealed a macular edema in only 1 of the 7 patients. Clinical improvement occurred when vemurafenib therapy was stopped in 5 of 7 patients. The rechallenge at treatment reintroduction was positive in 2 of 7 patients.
CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: This small case series highlights that uveitis can be a noteworthy adverse effect of vemurafenib therapy in patients with metastatic cutaneous melanoma. However, these cases of uveitis were usually restricted to the anterior segment and manageable with local corticosteroid therapy, which justified the continuation of vemurafenib therapy because the benefits regarding the patients' survival were greater than the risk to their vision.",12,2014-Dec-1

The purpose of this study was to report our experience with intravitreal bevacizumab for inflammation-related choroidal neovascularization in two tertiary centers.
METHODS: This study was a retrospective analysis of patients with choroidal neovascularization related to inflammatory diseases, treated with intravitreal bevacizumab injections (1.25 mg/0.05 mL).
RESULTS: Ten eyes of 10 patients (range, 14-78 years; mean age, 44 years) with underlying uveitis were treated with intravitreal bevacizumab for inflammation-related choroidal neovascularization from 2006 to 2008. Mean follow-up time was 13 +/- 8 months, and the mean number of injections was 2.7 +/- 2. Resolved leakage on fluorescein angiography and resolution of subretinal fluid on optical coherence tomography occurred in all patients, with improvement in visual acuity in 9 of 10 eyes and no change in visual acuity in 1 of 10 eyes. Seven patients received additional treatment based on the underlying condition. Mean macular thickness on optical coherence tomography decreased from 394 +/- 116 microm to 254 +/- 52 microm (P < 0.01). Mean visual acuity improved from 0.87 +/- 0.74 logarithm of the minimum angle of resolution to 0.38 +/- 0.63 (P = 0.005). Seven patients reached a visual acuity of 0.2 logarithm of the minimum angle of resolution (Snellen 6/9) or better.
CONCLUSION: Intravitreal bevacizumab is an effective treatment for choroidal neovascularization related to inflammatory diseases when inflammation is controlled.",12,2010-Jun-1

Recoverin is a calcium-binding protein identified as an autoantigen in a paraneoplastic degenerative disease of the human retina known as cancer-associated retinopathy (CAR). In this study we investigated whether recoverin could elicit an immune response leading to the degeneration of photoreceptor cells in a rodent retina, and whether an animal model of CAR could be developed. Injection of Lewis rats with recoverin caused degeneration of the photoreceptor cells. Several features of uveoretinitis were observed, including vitreous cells, perivasculitis, retinal lesions and complete loss of the photoreceptor cell layer. The first clinical signs of retinal inflammation were observed 10-14 days after immunization. The earliest histological changes in the retina also were observed 14 days after immunization. Infiltration of the photoreceptor cell layer and inner layers of the retina with lymphocytic and some polymorphonuclear cells was frequently observed. Photoreceptors were damaged and later fully degenerated. This sequence of events was associated with high antibody titers against recoverin in all animals tested. Cellular responses to recoverin assayed between days 7 and 28 after immunization showed strong in vitro proliferative activities to recoverin. In addition, all aspects of the degenerative events could be reproduced in naive animals by the adoptive transfer of stimulated lymphocytes obtained from animals previously immunized with recoverin. This study demonstrates the successful induction of photoreceptor degeneration using recoverin as an immunogen. We demonstrate that recoverin is both a potent antigen and uveitogen. These observations may be relevant to our understanding of CARs in humans.",12,1994-Oct-1

Uveitis is defined as intraocular inflammation. It is an extraarticular manifestation of many forms of joint disease, which include spondyloarthritis, juvenile idiopathic arthritis, and Behçet's disease. Rheumatologists may be asked to consult on the ophthalmologic care of patients with uveitis in order to identify an associated systemic illness. Diagnoses such as spondyloarthritis, sarcoidosis, and interstitial nephritis with uveitis are frequently overlooked by referring ophthalmologists. Alternatively, rheumatologists may be asked to help manage the patient's immunosuppression, including biologic therapy, which can be required to treat a subset of patients with uveitis. This review is intended to provide rheumatologists with the necessary information to facilitate collaboration in the comanagement of patients with uveitis.",12,2018-Oct-1

DESIGN: Retrospective cohort study.
METHODS: One hundred ninety-nine eyes of 129 patients diagnosed with uveitis associated with latent TB were evaluated for recurrence of disease following treatment. Eighty-nine of the patients (69%) received ATT and information was gathered retrospectively regarding clinical outcome, vision, and treatment. Outcome measures included best-corrected visual acuity (BCVA) and rate of disease recurrence.
RESULTS: This study included 89 patients (69%) who received ATT and 40 patients who did not. The uveitis was treated with local and systemic anti-inflammatory and immunosuppressive therapy in all patients. The mean change in BCVA following treatment was 4.5 ± 1.4 letters over the follow-up period, with no difference between eyes of patients receiving ATT and those who did not. Sixty-eight eyes (34.9%) had a recurrence of uveitis (0.64 ± 0.08 recurrences per year), with eyes of patients receiving ATT less likely to develop a recurrence compared to those not receiving ATT (29.5% vs 48.2%, odds ratio 0.47, 95% confidence interval 0.29-0.77, P = .003). Eyes treated with ATT recurred at an estimated median of 120 months, compared with 51 months in eyes with no treatment (P = .005).
CONCLUSIONS: Treatment with ATT halved the risk of uveitis recurrence and delayed the onset of the first recurrence in eyes with uveitis associated with latent TB.",12,2018-Jun-1

To analyse the nationwide prevalence of uveitis in JIA and its complications over a whole decade.
METHODS: We conducted a prospective, observational and cross-sectional study including all JIA patients from a National Paediatric Rheumatological Database (NPRD) with a uveitis add-on module in Germany (2002-2013). Temporal changes in uveitis prevalence, related secondary complications and anti-inflammatory medication were evaluated.
RESULTS: A total of 60 centres including 18,555 JIA patients (mean 3,863 patients/year, SD=837) were documented in the NPRD between 2002 and 2013. The mean age of the patients was 11.4 ± 4.6 years, their mean disease duration 4.4 ± 3.7 years. Among them, 66.9% were female and 51.7% ANA positive. Patients' mean age at arthritis onset was 6.9 ± 4.5 years. Treatment rates with synthetic and biological DMARDs increased during the observation period (sDMARD: 39.8% to 47.2%, bDMARD: 3.3% to 21.8%). Uveitis prevalence decreased significantly from 2002 to 2013 (13.0% to 11.6%, OR = 0.98, p=0.015). The prevalence of secondary uveitis complications also decreased significantly between 2002 and 2013 (33.6% to 23.9%, OR=0.94, p<0.001). Among the complications, the most common ones were posterior synechiae, cataract and band keratopathy. A significant increase in achieving uveitis inactivity was observed at 30.6% in 2002 and 65.3% in 2013 (OR=1.15, p<0.001).
CONCLUSIONS: Uveitis prevalence and complications significantly decreased between 2002 and 2013. This may be associated with a more frequent use of DMARDs.",12,2015-1-1

Epidemiology is frequently neglected in the study of uveitis. Little is known on the incidence and prevalence of this disease. This review presents data on the subject from the literature and from the uveitis clinic at Rotterdam. The distribution of uveitis varies in different parts of the world and these differences might be attributed to geographic, alimentary or genetic factors. The discovery of associations of certain types of uveitis and HLA antigen subclasses provided at least part of an explanation for racial and genetic factors. These associations are dealt with in more detail.",12,1992-1-1

Blau syndrome is a rare autosomal dominant monogenic auto-inflammatory disorder characterized by triad of granulomatous polyarthritis, dermatitis, and uveitis. However, it may be difficult to recognize this syndrome in the absence of all three characteristic clinical manifestations. A 3-year-old girl presented with early onset symmetric polyarthritis and developed granulomatous uveitis at 13 years of age. However, Blau syndrome was suspected at 21 years of age when she was diagnosed to have disseminated granulomas in liver and kidneys. Diagnosis of Blau syndrome was confirmed by finding a mutation in NOD2 gene (p.Arg334Gln; FP2678). She was initiated on adalimumab therapy and she showed good response to this treatment. We did a literature search to find out all reported cases of Blau syndrome with disseminated granulomatous inflammation and all cases of Blau syndrome that were treated with adalimumab therapy. Seventeen patients with Blau syndrome have been reported to have granulomas at unusual locations (liver; kidneys; lungs; salivary glands; intestine; and lymph nodes). Adalimumab has been reported to be used in 33 patients with Blau syndrome. The indication to initiate adalimumab in large majority of these patients was persistence of uveitis. A possibility of Blau syndrome should be considered in all children presenting with early onset arthritis (especially with the presence of boggy swelling) and granulomatous uveitis. Granulomas in the liver and kidney are uncommon disease manifestations. Adalimumab may be an effective treatment for patients with Blau syndrome who are resistant to other forms of therapy.",12,2021-Jan-1

To study the role of intraoperative intravitreal dexamethasone implant in patients of uveitis with cataract undergoing phacoemulsification.
METHODS: This prospective study included 20 patients with uveitis and cataract who underwent phacoemulsification with intraocular lens implantation. Ten patients (10 eyes) received an intravitreal dexamethasone implant intraoperatively (implant group), and 10 patients (10 eyes) received oral steroids (steroid group). Outcome measures were best-corrected visual acuity (BCVA), intraocular pressure (IOP), and central macular thickness (CMT).
RESULTS: The logMar BCVA improved from 0.93 ± 0.49 to 0.23 ± 0.23 and from 1.29 ± 0.47 to 0.22 ± 0.16 in the implant and steroid groups, respectively. Postoperative IOP and CMT showed no statistically significant differences between the two groups. None of the patients in either group had significant IOP rise requiring any surgical intervention.
CONCLUSIONS: A single intraoperative intravitreal dexamethasone implant during phacoemulsification in patients of uveitis with cataract seems to be an effective alternative for postoperative oral steroids.",12,2013-Dec-1

METHODS: Records of 170 patients seen in 1990-1994 and 258 patients seen in 2000-2004 were reviewed. Presenting features were analyzed in the whole cohort. Uveitis attacks, vision, complications, and immunomodulatory treatment (IMT) were compared in patients with 3-year follow-up.
RESULTS: Posterior segment involvement was less common, visual acuity was better, and more patients received IMT before referral in the 2000s. Follow-up revealed no significant difference in number of uveitis attacks in the first 3 years. Less eyes lost useful vision, no patient became legally blind, and fewer severe ocular complications occurred in the 2000s. IMT was started within 3 months in more patients and interferon alfa-2a was used only in the latter study period.
CONCLUSIONS: The findings suggest a milder disease at referral, lower rate of severe complications, and a better 3-year visual outcome in patients who presented in the early 2000s.",12,2012-Dec-1

To assess the diagnostic performance and generalizability of logistic regression in classifying primary vitreoretinal lymphoma (PVRL) versus uveitis from intraocular cytokine levels in a single-center retrospective cohort, comparing a logistic regression model and previously published Interleukin Score for Intraocular Lymphoma Diagnosis (ISOLD) scores against the interleukin 10 (IL-10)-to-interleukin 6 (IL-6) ratio.
DESIGN: Retrospective cohort study.
PARTICIPANTS: Patient histories, pathology reports, and intraocular cytokine levels from 2339 patient entries in the National Eye Institute Histopathology Core database.
METHODS: Patient diagnoses of PVRL versus uveitis and associated aqueous or vitreous IL-6 and IL-10 levels were collected retrospectively. From these data, cytokine levels were compared between diagnoses with the Mann-Whitney U test. A logistic regression model was trained to classify PVRL versus uveitis from aqueous and vitreous IL-6 and IL-10 samples and compared with ISOLD scores and IL-10-to-IL-6 ratios.
MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC) for each classifier and sensitivity, specificity, positive predictive value (PPV), and negative predictive value (NPV) at the optimal cutoff (maximal Youden index) for each classifier.
RESULTS: Seventy-seven lymphoma patients (10 aqueous samples, 67 vitreous samples) and 84 uveitis patients (19 aqueous samples, 65 vitreous samples) treated between October 5, 1999, and September 16, 2015, were included. Interleukin 6 levels were higher and IL-10 levels were lower in uveitis patients compared with lymphoma patients (P < 0.01). For vitreous samples, the logistic regression model, ISOLD score, and IL-10-to-IL-6 ratio achieved AUCs of 98.3%, 97.7%, and 96.3%, respectively. Sensitivity, specificity, PPV, and NPV at the optimal cutoffs for each classifier were 94.2%, 96.9%, 97%, and 94% for the logistic regression model; 92.7%, 100%, 100%, and 92.9% for the ISOLD score; and 94.2%, 95.3%, 95.6%, and 93.9% for the IL-10-to-IL-6 ratio. All models achieved complete separation between uveitis and lymphoma in the aqueous data set.
CONCLUSIONS: The accuracy of the logistic regression model and generalizability of the ISOLD score to an independent patient cohort suggest that intraocular cytokine analysis by logistic regression may be a promising adjunct to cytopathologic analysis, the gold standard, for the early diagnosis of primary vitreoretinal lymphoma. Further validation studies are merited.",12,2020-Jul-1

We conducted a retrospective analysis of 1122 patients with endogenous uveitis treated at the University Eye Clinic in Turku during the years 1980-1982 and 1988. Of the 1122 patients 568 were men and 554 women; 1034 (92.2%) had anterior uveitis, 15 (1.3%) intermediate uveitis, 64 (5.7%) posterior uveitis and 9(0.8%) panuveitis; 867 (77.3%) were unilateral and 255 bilateral; 789 of 1067 cases (73.9%) were of sudden onset and 278 of insidious onset; 808 of 1102 cases (73.3%) were of short duration and 294 of long duration; and 519 (46.3%) single and 603 repeated. In this study uveitis occurred significantly more often (44.2%) in the age group 20-39 years than in other age groups (p < 0.00001). Anterior and posterior uveitis were more often unilateral than bilateral (p < 0.0005) and of sudden onset than of insidious onset (p < 0.00008). Acute anterior uveitis was the most common uveitic entity and accounted for 745 cases (66.4%). Acute anterior uveitis associated with ankylosing spondylitis was the single most frequently seen diagnostic group including 144 cases (12.8%) with a statistically significant male predominance (p < 0.00001).",12,1994-Aug-1

Several pathogenetic studies have paved the way for a newer more rational therapeutic approach to non-infectious uveitis, and treatment of different forms of immune-driven uveitis has drastically evolved in recent years after the advent of biotechnological drugs. Tumor necrosis factor-α targeted therapies, the first-line recommended biologics in uveitis, have certainly led to remarkable results in patients with non-infectious uveitis. Nevertheless, the decision-making process turns out to be extremely difficult in anti-tumor necrosis factor or multidrug-resistant cases. Interleukin (IL)-6 holds a critical role in the pathogenic pathways of uveitis, due to its extended and protean range of effects. On this background, manipulation of IL-6 inflammatory cascade has unraveled encouraging outcomes. For instance, rising evidence has been achieved regarding the successful use of tocilizumab, the humanized monoclonal antibody targeted against the IL-6 receptor, in treating uveitis related to juvenile idiopathic arthritis or Behçet's disease. Similar findings have also been reported for uveitis associated with systemic disorders, such as rheumatoid arthritis or multicentric Castleman disease, but also for idiopathic uveitis, the rare birdshot chorioretinopathy, and even in cases complicated by macular edema. This work provides a digest of all current experiences and evidences concerning IL-6 blockade, as suggested by the medical literature, proving its potential role in the management of non-infectious uveitis.",12,2017-Jul-1

We followed 210 cases of juvenile rheumatoid arthritis closely for eleven years. Thirty-six of the 210 patients (17.2%) developed iridocyclitis. Iridocyclitis was seen most frequently in young female patients (0 to 4 years) with the monoarticular or pauciatricular form of the arthritis. However, 30% of the patients developed uveitis after 16 years of age. Although 61% of patients had a noncontributory ocular history on entry, 42% had active uveitis on entry. Our approach was effective in detecting uveitis in new cases and exacerbations of uveitis in established cases. Forty-four percent of patients with uveitis had one or more identifiable signs or symptoms, such as red eye, ocular pain, decreased visual acuity, or photophobia, in order of decreasing frequency. Even after early detection and prompt treatment, 41% of cases of uveitis did not respond to more than six months of intensive topical treatment with corticosteroids and mydriatics. Despite this, there was a dramatic decrease in the 50% incidence of blinding complications of uveitis cited in earlier studies. Cataract and band keratopathy occurred in only 22 and 13% of our group, respectively. We used chloroquine or hydroxychloroquine in 173 of 210 cases and found only one case of chorioretinopathy attributable to these drugs. Systemically administered corticosteroids were used in 75 of 210 cases; a significant number of posterior subcapsular cataracts was found. Typical keratoconjunctivitis sicca developed in three of the uveitis cases. This association with uveitis and JRA was not noted previously. Surgical treatment of cataracts, band keratopathy, and glaucoma achieved uniformly discouraging results.",12,1975-Jun-1

Bortezomib is a proteasome inhibitor used for hematologic cancer treatment. Since it can suppress NF-κB activation, which is critical for the inflammatory process, bortezomib has been found to possess anti-inflammatory activity. In this study, we evaluated the effect of bortezomib on experimental autoimmune uveitis (EAU) in mice and investigated the potential mechanisms related to NF-κB inactivation. High-dose bortezomib (0.75 mg/kg), low-dose bortezomib (0.15 mg/kg), or phosphate buffered saline was given after EAU induction. We found that the EAU is ameliorated by high-dose bortezomib treatment when compared with low-dose bortezomib or PBS treatment. The DNA-binding activity of NF-κB was suppressed and expression of several key inflammatory mediators including TNF-α, IL-1α, IL-1β, IL-12, IL-17, and MCP-1 was lowered in the high-dose bortezomib-treated group. These results suggest that proteasome inhibition is a promising treatment strategy for autoimmune uveitis.",12,2015-1-1

The visual outcome of uveitic cataract surgery depends on the underlying uveitic diagnosis, the presence of vision-limiting pathology and perioperative optimization of disease control. A comprehensive preoperative ophthalmic assessment for the presence of concomitant ocular pathology, with particular emphasis on macula and optic nerve involvement, is essential to determine which patients will benefit from improved vision after cataract surgery. Meticulous examination in conjunction with adjunct investigations can help in preoperative surgical planning and in determining the need for combined or staged procedures. The eye should be quiescent for a minimum of 3 months before cataract surgery. Perioperative corticosteroid prophylaxis is important to reduce the risk of cystoid macular edema and recurrence of the uveitis. Antimicrobial prophylaxis may also reduce the risk of reactivation in eyes with infectious uveitis. Uveitic cataracts may be surgically demanding due to the presence of synechiae, membranes, and pupil abnormalities that limit access to the cataract. This can be overcome by manual stretching, multiple sphincterotomies or mechanical dilation with pupil dilation devices. In patients <2 years of age and in eyes where the inflammation is poorly controlled, intraocular lens implantation should be deferred. Intensive local and/or oral steroid prophylaxis should be given postoperatively if indicated. Patients must be monitored closely for disease recurrence, excessive inflammation, raised intraocular pressure, hypotony, and other complications. Complications must be treated aggressively to improve visual rehabilitation. With proper patient selection, improved surgical techniques and optimization of peri- and post-operative care, patients with uveitic cataracts can achieve good visual outcomes.",12,2017-Dec-1

To evaluate the long-term safety and efficacy of Mycophenolate Mofetil (MMF) for the control of cystoid macular oedema (CMO) secondary to noninfectious uveitis (NU).
METHODS: The medical records of 19 consecutive patients with inflammatory CMO treated with MMF were retrospectively reviewed. Patient demographics, best corrected visual acuity (BCVA), fluorescein angiography (FA), and optical coherence tomography (OCT) findings were evaluated.
RESULTS: There were eight females and 11 males with a mean age of 32.9 +/- 8.9 years. After a 1-year follow-up, 18/19 patients (31 eyes, 96.9%, P < 0.05) no longer had signs of CMO, as per their FA and OCT findings; the mean central foveal thickness (CFT) was 167.2 +/- 12.8 microm. At the last follow-up, only 3/19 patients, all affected by Behçet panuveitis, had recurrences of CMO. Mean BCVA improved from 0.34 +/- 0.14 SD at baseline to 0.65 +/- 0.2 SD at last follow-up.
CONCLUSIONS: MMF was safe and effective in controlling CMO and in reducing the uveitis relapse rate in patients not responding to traditional immunosuppressants. Further case-controlled studies are mandatory to validate those preliminary results.",12,2009-Jun-1

One hundred cases of clinically acceptable sympathetic ophthalmia (SO) were evaluated histologically to determine the incidence of atypical features and correlate them with the severity of choroidal inflammation. The inflammatory response in the choroid varied from a focal non-granulomatous to a diffuse non-necrotizing granulomatous process. The choriocapillaris was focally involved rather frequently (in 40% of the cases). This was associated with severe inflammation. Chorioretinal adhesions were noted in 7% of the cases. Retinal detachment was observed in 50% of the cases, and this was associated with severe uveal inflammation. Fifty percent of the cases showed retinal perivasculitis and 18% a mild inflammatory infiltrate of the retina. Involvement of the meninges (a finding present in 22% of the cases) and severe inflammation in the scleral canals were both related to the severity of choroidal inflammation. Lens-induced endophthalmitis was observed in 14 cases and was not associated with the severity of the choroidal inflammation. Our observations indicate that the changes interpreted as atypical in SO are usually associated with severe choroidal inflammation, suggesting that these features may be the response to high doses of antigenic agent. The classical histopathologic description of SO may represent only one manifestation of the pathologic response of this disease.",12,1982-Feb-1

To assess the use of adalimumab in the treatment of refractory non-infectious childhood chronic uveitis.
METHODS: A case cohort interventional study was performed on patients with uveitis, who were treated with adalimumab after failure of treatment with a combination of corticosteroids and another immunosuppressant drug. Main outcome measures were (i) stability of vision, (ii) stability of inflammation and (iii) reduction of immunosuppressive load. Adverse events and reasons for stopping adalimumab were noted.
RESULTS: Seventeen patients from a single regional centre were included in the study. Nine patients had previously received an anti-TNF agent, and because of inefficacy, all were changed to adalimumab. At 12 months, fewer patients had visual acuity worse than LogMAR 0.4 (18% vs 32% at baseline). Using standardized uveitis nomenclature criteria, at 3 months, 50% of the patients eyes (n = 32) had improved, 16% had stable inflammation and 3% had worsened, whereas 31% were maintained with no anterior chamber cells. Six patients required courses of oral steroids for uveitis. Seven patients received intra- or periocular injections of steroids. Adalimumab treatment was interrupted in one patient because of varicella zoster infection. It was stopped in three patients. Seven (41%) patients reported injection site reactions.
CONCLUSION: In this group of children with refractory uveitis, use of adalimumab was associated with improvement in visual acuity and improving or stable ocular inflammation. However, it did not completely obviate the need for systemic or periocular steroid treatment. Prospective randomized controlled trials are required to help determine which subset of patients may benefit from adalimumab and the duration of treatment.",12,2012-Dec-1

The purpose of this study was to evaluate the efficacy of a Coulomb Controlled Iontophoresis system (CCI) in the local delivery of corticosteroids for the treatment of uveitis. The therapeutic efficacy of Dexamethasone (Dex) administered by CCI was compared to systemic injection and to topical application with the iontophoresis apparatus in the absence of electrical current. The evaluation was done in the treatment of the endotoxin-induced uveitis (EIU) model, and in the effect on TNF gene expression in the iris/ciliary body as well as in the retina and on TNF levels in aqueous humor and vitreous. Dex was administered either at the time of LPS injection or 5 hours later. For iontophoresis, we used a 1 ml reservoir-electrode covering the cornea, the limbus, and the first millimeter of the sclera. The applied electrical current was of 400 microA during four minutes with a total surface charge of 0.4 C cm-2. EIU was evaluated by clinical examination, by counts of intraocular inflammatory cells on histological sections, and by measuring the protein levels in the aqueous humor and in the vitreous. The TNF-alpha gene expression in the iris and ciliary body, and in the retina was evaluated by RT-PCR. The systemic effect of Dex delivered by CCI was evaluated on the level of serum TNF-alpha in EIU. Our results demonstrated that local administration of Dex by CCI inhibited anterior and posterior signs of intraocular inflammation as effectively as systemic administration, with no effect on systemic level of TNF. In the anterior and posterior segments of the eye, the protein exudation. TNF levels and the cellular infiltration were inhibited. The TNF-alpha gene expression was inhibited in the anterior as well as the posterior segment of the eye. No clinical nor histological damage were caused by the CCI apparatus. In conclusion, CCI administration of Dex allows for a therapeutic effect on the posterior as well as the anterior segment of the eye, and may present a viable alternative to systemic administration of glucocorticoids in severe ocular inflammations.",12,1997-Oct-1

Cystoid macular edema (CME) is a major cause of visual impairment and is thought to be due to abnormal perifoveal capillary permeability. Posterior sub-Tenon's corticosteroid injections are used to improve the visual acuity in CME, although their mechanism of action is uncertain. In this study, visual acuity, blood retinal barrier (BRB) permeability, and fluorescein angiograms were recorded immediately before and one and four weeks after the administration of steroid injections. Ten patients (12 treated eyes) with CME secondary to uveitis were studied. Visual improvement, defined as an increase in at least two lines of Snellen visual acuity, was seen in half of the treated eyes. In some patients, these improvements were not directly related to changes in the BRB permeability or the amount of macular fluid. Posterior sub-Tenon's corticosteroid injections do not consistently affect blood retinal barrier permeability.",12,1988-1-1

To investigate the demographic characteristics and ocular features of patients with childhood-onset Behçet disease.
PATIENTS AND METHODS: Patients for this retrospective study were selected using the data obtained from medical records of 34 patients with childhood-onset Behçet disease being followed up in the Uveitis Department of Ankara Ulucanlar Eye Education and Research Hospital between January 2003 and May 2008.
RESULTS: Of 34 patients, 24 were boys (70.5%) and 10 were girls (29.4%). The average age of patients was 14.5 +/- 1.9 years (range, 10-16 years). Mean follow-up period was 4.5 +/- 2 years (range, 2-10 years). During the follow-up, panuveitis, posterior uveitis, and anterior uveitis were diagnosed in 18 (52.9%), 11 (32.3%), and 5 (14.7%) patients, respectively. Ocular findings included cataract in 20 patients (58.8%), posterior synechiae in 8 (23.5%), posterior capsular opacification secondary to cataract surgery in 8 (23.5%), vitreous condensation due to previous episodes of vitritis in 17 (50%), optic atrophy in 10 (29.4%), cystoid macular edema in 5 patients (14.7%), narrowed and occluded retinal vessels due to retinal periphlebitis and branched retinal vein occlusion in 2 (5.8%), neovascularization of the disk in 1 (2.9%), and phthisis bulbi in 1 patient (2.9%).
CONCLUSIONS: Based on the results that were obtained in this series, panuveitis was the most common type of uveitis in cases with childhood-onset Behçet disease. Cataract was the most common anterior segment complication. Optic atrophy was the most common posterior segment complication. Male predominance was determined in this study.",12,2009-Aug-1

The prevalence of human T cell lymphoma virus type 1 (HTLV-I) was studied among patients with endogenous uveitis. Twelve (15.8%) of 76 uveitis patients with known aetiology or clinical entity were seropositive, the prevalence being comparable with that in the general population of the southwestern area of Japan where HTLV-I is highly endemic. In the comparison, 32 (41.0%) of 78 patients with aetiology or entity undefined uveitis were seropositive for HTLV-I, which indicated a significantly higher seroprevalence than controls matched for sex and age. The 32 cases of clinical entity undefined, HTLV-I positive uveitis were characterised by acute granulomatous or non-granulomatous uveal reactions which were accompanied by vitreous opacities and retinal vasculitis. The uveal inflammatory and retinal vascular changes responded well to topical and/or systemic corticosteroids and resolved in a few weeks in the majority of cases with favourable visual outcome. The disease affected one or both eyes, and eight cases (25%) showed recurrence within a year. The general condition of the patients remained well otherwise during a follow up study (mean follow up time 15.4 months), except for three cases with a possible association of hyperthyroidism. These findings provide additional information favouring an association between HTLV-I and isolated uveitis, a new disease entity which should be termed HTLV-I-associated uveitis.",12,1993-May-1

PMID: 33845001
The purpose of this study was to determine classification criteria for sarcoidosis-associated uveitis.
DESIGN: Machine learning of cases with sarcoid uveitis and 15 other uveitides.
METHODS: Cases of anterior, intermediate, and panuveitides were collected in an informatics-designed preliminary database, and a final database was constructed including cases achieving supermajority agreement on the diagnosis, using formal consensus techniques. Cases were analyzed by anatomic class, and each class was split into a training set and a validation set. Machine learning using multinomial logistic regression was used in the training sets to determine a parsimonious set of criteria that minimized the misclassification rate among the uveitides. The resulting criteria were evaluated in the validation sets.
RESULTS: A total of 1,083 cases of anterior uveitides, 589 cases of intermediate uveitides, and 1,012 cases of panuveitides, including 278 cases of sarcoidosis-associated uveitis, were evaluated by machine learning. Key criteria for sarcoidosis-associated uveitis included a compatible uveitic syndrome of any anatomic class and evidence of sarcoidosis, either 1) tissue biopsy results demonstrating non-caseating granulomata or 2) bilateral hilar adenopathy on chest imaging. The overall accuracy of the diagnosis of sarcoidosis-associated uveitis in the validation set was 99.7% (95% confidence interval: 98.8-99.9). The misclassification rates for sarcoidosis-associated uveitis in the training sets were 3.2% in anterior uveitis, 2.6% in intermediate uveitis, and 1.2% in panuveitis; in the validation sets, the misclassification rates were 0% in anterior uveitis, 0% in intermediate uveitis, and 0% in panuveitis.
CONCLUSIONS: The criteria for sarcoidosis-associated uveitis had a low misclassification rate and appeared to perform sufficiently well for use in clinical and translational research.",12,2021-Aug-1

The long-term course of juvenile idiopathic arthritis (JIA)-associated uveitis is not known yet. This study investigates the course and activity of JIA-associated uveitis in childhood and puberty.
DESIGN: Retrospective study of the clinical data of 62 JIA patients with uveitis. The main outcome measurements consisted of uveitis activity measured as mean cell grade in the anterior chamber, topical and systemic medication and ocular complications related to disease activity. All data were scored and evaluated per year of age.
RESULTS: Uveitis activity took a biphasic course with a quiet phase around the age of 9 years and showed increased activity during early teenage years. The biphasic course was significantly related to age (p=0.048) but not to uveitis duration. More patients were treated with systemic immunosuppressive medication in estimated puberty years (63% in boys, 53% in girls) compared with prepuberty years (46% and 28%, respectively), although the difference was only significant in girls (p<0.001). The presence of cystoid macular oedema and papillitis was not significantly related to estimated puberty, but the development of an hypotonous eye was more frequently observed in boys in estimated puberty years (p=0.026).
CONCLUSIONS: JIA-associated uveitis appears to take a biphasic course with the second phase of activity during early teenage years and more treatment with systemic immunosuppressive medication occurred during estimated puberty compared with prepuberty years.",12,2012-Jun-1

To determine the ophthalmological and extra-ophthalmological clinical characteristics and visual prognosis of patients with sarcoid uveitis in different ethnic groups.
METHODS: We retrospectively analysed the data from patients with sarcoid uveitis seen at two departments of Ophthalmology between December 2003 and December 2017. Patients presented biopsy-proven sarcoidosis and/or presumed sarcoid uveitis based on the following criteria: compatible thoracic imaging, associated with elevated angiotensin-conversion enzyme (ACE) and/or lymphocytic alveolitis on bronchoalveolar lavage fluid analysis (> 15% lymphocytes and CD4/CD8 > 3.5). Ophthalmological and general characteristics, as well as visual and global prognoses, were compared in three pre-defined ethnic groups: White Europeans, North Africans and Afro-Caribbeans.
RESULTS: A total of 194 patients were included: 145 with biopsy-proven and 49 with presumed sarcoid uveitis. Overall, 68% were White Europeans while 20.6% were North Africans and 11.3% were Afro-Caribbeans. Sixty-nine per cent were women and the median age at presentation was 52.1 years. Median ages at first ocular manifestation of the disease in Afro-Caribbeans and North Africans were respectively 34.3 and 43.1 years, while it was 57.8 years in White Europeans (p < 0.001). Ocular involvement was bilateral in 77.8% (n = 151) of the cases and nearly half of the patients had panuveitis (48.5%). Anterior uveitis was more frequent in Afro-Caribbeans (59.1%; p < 0.0001), while White Europeans presented more frequently with intermediate uveitis. There was a significantly higher frequency of systemic involvement of sarcoidosis in North Africans while White Europeans showed a higher frequency of isolated ocular involvement at onset and during follow-up. Afro-Caribbeans, who had a complete visual recovery in 72.7% of the cases, had a better visual prognosis than other ethnic groups (p = 0.025).
CONCLUSION: In this large European series of sarcoid uveitis, we observed ethnicity-related differences regarding uveitis clinical presentation and visual outcome. Although good overall, the visual prognosis seems to be better in Afro-Caribbeans than in other ethnic groups.",12,2019-Nov-1

To evaluate reactivation of pediatric uveitis during/following treatment with tumor necrosis factor alpha inhibition (anti-TNFα).
DESIGN: Retrospective cohort study.
METHODS: We assessed the incidence of uveitis reactivation in children ≤18 years who had achieved uveitis quiescence under anti-TNFα. Survival analysis was used to calculate reactivation rates while still on (primary outcome), and following discontinuation of (secondary outcome), anti-TNFα. Potential predictive factors were assessed.
RESULTS: Among 50 children observed to develop quiescence of uveitis under anti-TNFα, 39 met criteria to be ""at risk"" of the primary (19 for the secondary) outcome. 60% were female, ∼half had juvenile idiopathic arthritis, and most were treated with infliximab. Overall, the estimated proportion relapsing within 12 months was 27.8% (95% confidence interval [CI]: 15.9%-45.8%); the estimated probability of reactivation was higher following (63.8% [95% CI: 38.9%-87.7%]) vs before (21.6% [95% CI: 10.8%-40.2%]) anti-TNFα discontinuation. Among those who discontinued anti-TNFα, the likelihood of reactivation was higher for those treated with adalimumab vs infliximab (hazard ratio [HR] 13.4, P = .01, 95% CI: 2.2-82.5) and those with older age at uveitis onset (HR 1.3, P = .09, 95% CI: 1.0-1.7). The duration of suppression, on medication, did not significantly affect the likelihood of reactivation when quiescence was maintained for ≥1.5 years.
CONCLUSIONS: Approximately 75% of children remaining on anti-TNFα following achievement of uveitis quiescence remain quiescent at 1 year. However, most reactivate following anti-TNFα discontinuation. These results suggest that infliximab more often is followed by remission, off medication, than adalimumab. The data do not suggest that maintenance of suppression for more than 1.5 years decreases the reactivation risk.",12,2015-Jul-1

In this study, rats with S-antigen-induced uveitis were treated with W3/25, a monoclonal antibody that recognizes the CD4 molecule expressed by helper/inducer cells. Treatment was started on day 5 after administration of S-antigen. Groups of animals were killed 18 or 31 days after S-antigen injection. The enucleated globes were studied histologically, and in vitro T-cell response and anti-S antibody levels were determined. Results showed that the antibody treatment prevented development of experimental autoimmune uveitis (EAU) in all animals. Furthermore, there was no evidence of disease development for 14 days after cessation of therapy. These results suggest that CD4+ cells are important in the initiation of EAU, and that monoclonal antibodies directed to this subset may provide effective treatment of autoimmune uveal inflammation.",12,1990-Jul-1

Non-infectious uveitis (NIU) leads to severe visual impairment, potentially impacting on health-related quality of life (QoL).
OBJECTIVES: To investigate the impact of NIU on QoL.
METHODS: Eighty NIU patients and 23 healthy controls completed the 36-item Short-Form Health Survey (SF)-36. The SF-36 values were statistically analyzed to evaluate differences between patients and healthy controls and to identify correlations between SF-36 subscores and clinical/demographic data.
RESULTS: NIU patients showed a decrease in the physical component summary score (P < 0.0001) compared to healthy controls, while no difference was highlighted in the mental component summary score (P = 0.97). NIU patients showed a decrease in physical functioning (P = 0.008), role-physical (P = 0.003), bodily pain (P = 0.0001), general health (P < 0.0001), and social functioning (P = 0.01). Physical functioning was lower in patients with acute anterior uveitis (AAU) than in those with panuveitis (P = 0.003). No differences were found between patients with bilateral or unilateral NIU, isolated NIU, or NIU associated with systemic diseases and with or without ocular activity. No correlations were identified between best-corrected visual acuity and SF-36 subscores. Physical functioning (P = 0.02), bodily pain (P = 0.004), and social functioning (P = 0.02) were reduced in males versus females.
CONCLUSIONS: QoL is impaired in individuals with NIU, particularly in the physical domains, general health, and social functioning. AAU affects physical functioning more than panuveitis. NIU seems to affect per se QoL disregarding inflammatory activity, visual impairment, and presence of associated systemic diseases.",12,2017-Aug-1

We evaluated the outcomes of patients with different forms of chronic uveitis treated with mycophenolate mofetil (MMF) as an immunomodulatory and steroid-sparing agent. The multi-system side effects that arise after long-term treatment with corticosteroids and other immunosuppressants prompted us to use MMF. MMF is a selective inhibitor of inosine monophosphate dehydrogenase, thus blocking purine synthesis via the de novo pathway preferentially used by T and B lymphocytes.
METHODS: Between 1998 and 2003, 106 patients were treated for uveitis (anterior n=26, intermediate n=51, posterior n=23, panuveitis n=6) with MMF at a dose of 1g twice daily. Treatment duration was at least 6 months (n=10), in most cases greater than 12 months (n=77) and in 25 cases between 24 months and 41 months, when the present retrospective evaluation was undertaken. Patient charts were analysed according to a standardized evaluation protocol.
RESULTS: In 95 patients MMF was combined with prednisolone at a dosage of 2.5-10 mg per day. In 8 patients MMF was used as a monotherapy, and in 3 cases one further systemic immunosuppressant was required. The number of recurrences during MMF treatment was none or one in 92 patients, two in 6 cases and three or more in 8 patients. In none of the patients had MMF been stopped at the time of data analysis. The most frequently observed side effects were gastrointestinal upset (15%), followed by headache (9.3%), fatigue (5.7%), eczema (5%), and hair loss (3.5%). Other side effects were sporadic. Most of these phenomena were transitory. Forty-two patients experienced no side effects at all. In 4 patients MMF was judged ineffective due to failure to reduce the number of recurrences of severe inflammation compared with the previous therapeutic regime, or indeed occurrence of persistent macular oedema.
CONCLUSIONS: Our results show that MMF is an effective immunosuppressant in patients with uveitis. We provide evidence that MMF controls the disease in the majority of patients with an acceptable profile of side effects.",12,2006-Jul-1

The differential diagnosis of posterior infectious uveitis is broad. There are, however, a few common infectious causes of posterior uveitis that should always be considered. The more common infectious causes of posterior uveitis include syphilis, toxoplasmosis, tuberculosis, endogenous endophthalmitis, and viral causes (including herpes simplex virus, herpes zoster virus, and cytomegalovirus).

To assess the efficacy of glaucoma drainage devices (GDD) in uveitic glaucoma and non-uveitic glaucoma, and to perform a meta-analysis of previously published results to compare with our data.
METHODS: Retrospective case-control study, in which all eyes that underwent GDD surgery were included from 2015 onwards. Cases were defined as patients with uveitic glaucoma. Patients with non-uveitic glaucoma served as controls. To compare our results, a review of the literature was performed using PubMed database.
RESULTS: A total of 99 eyes were included (38 with uveitic glaucoma). The preoperative IOP was 25.9 ± 7.7 mmHg and 27.9 ± 9.6 mmHg for patients with and without uveitis (p = 0.277). No significant differences were found between patients with and without uveitis in the final IOP or reduction in IOP (44.9% vs. 42.8%, respectively). Within the first year after surgery, 13.2% of cases developed macular edema (vs. 6.6%; p = 0.267) and 15.8% a transient hypotony (vs. 8.2%; p = 0.242). A meta-analysis of 24 studies showed a postoperative weighted mean difference of - 17.8 mmHg and 2.2 lower number of IOP-lowering medications in uveitic glaucoma (compared to - 13.2 mmHg and 3.5 in the current study, respectively).
CONCLUSION: GDD surgery in patients with uveitis has a similar effect on IOP as in patients without uveitis. The risks of developing macular edema and hypotony were slightly higher in patients with uveitis, but the results were not statistically significant. These findings are in line with previous reports, though data on the efficacy of GDD surgery and macular edema in uveitic glaucoma is scarce.",12,2019-Jan-1

To determine rate, risk factors, and longterm outcome of uveitis in children with juvenile idiopathic arthritis (JIA) in Switzerland and compare the results with a study of a different center in Switzerland from 1992.
METHODS: Retrospective analysis of the charts and ophthalmologists' reports of all patients with JIA in a tertiary care outpatient clinic between January 1, 1997, and December 31, 2005, for diagnosis, course, and outcome of uveitis.
RESULTS: Uveitis occurred in 35/265 patients (13.2%) of our JIA cohort, which is similar to the 16% reported in the 1992 cohort. A positive test for antinuclear antibodies was the strongest risk factor. The JIA subgroup with the highest rate of uveitis was ""other arthritis,"" followed by oligoarticular JIA. Extended and persistent course of oligoarticular JIA had a similar uveitis incidence, but all patients with extended-course disease developed uveitis before more than 4 joints were affected. After a mean followup of 5.62 years (range 0.5-15.17), 12/35 (34%) patients with uveitis had developed uveitis complications. Best corrected visual acuity was normal in 91% of patients. Only 5.6% of the affected eyes were legally blind as compared to 17.6% in the 1992 cohort.
CONCLUSION: The rate of uveitis was 13.2% in our cohort of Swiss children and has not changed since 1992. Despite the high rate of uveitis complications, the longterm visual outcome was excellent.",12,2008-Apr-1

In recent decades, the treatment paradigm for noninfectious intermediate uveitis, posterior uveitis, and panuveitis, a group of intraocular inflammatory diseases, has included systemic and local (periocular or intraocular) corticosteroids, biologics, and other steroid-sparing immunomodulatory therapy agents. Recently, an intravitreal formulation of sirolimus, an immunosuppressant that inhibits the mammalian target of rapamycin, a key regulator of cell growth in the immune system, was developed. On the basis of this mechanism and the local method of delivery, it was hypothesized that intravitreal sirolimus can improve ocular inflammation in patients with noninfectious intermediate uveitis, posterior uveitis, and panuveitis, with minimal systemic exposure and systemic adverse events (AEs). This review summarizes the pharmacokinetics, efficacy, and safety results of intravitreal sirolimus from 3 preclinical studies and 4 phase 1-3 clinical studies. Preclinical studies in rabbits showed that 22 to 220 μg intravitreal sirolimus results in sustained release of sirolimus in the vitreous for 2 months or more, with systemic concentrations below the threshold for systemic immunosuppression (approximately 8 ng/ml). Subsequently, 2 phase 1 studies (n = 50 and n = 30) established that intravitreal sirolimus improves ocular inflammation in humans. Further investigation in phase 2 and 3 studies (n = 24 and n = 347, respectively) suggested that 440 μg has the best benefit-to-risk profile. In the phase 3 study, the proportion of patients who showed complete resolution of ocular inflammation at month 5 was significantly higher in the 440-μg group than in the 44-μg group (22.8% vs. 10.3%; P = 0.025, Fisher exact test). In addition, 47 of 69 patients (68.1%) who were treated with systemic corticosteroids at baseline discontinued corticosteroid use at month 5. No sirolimus-related systemic AEs were reported in phase 1-3 studies. Collectively, these preclinical and clinical study data of intravitreal sirolimus support the therapeutic rationale of treating noninfectious uveitis with a local mammalian target of rapamycin inhibitor and suggest that 440 μg intravitreal sirolimus has the potential to be an effective and well-tolerated anti-inflammatory and corticosteroid-sparing treatment for noninfectious intermediate uveitis, posterior uveitis, and panuveitis.",12,2018-Dec-1

The relationship between breed and the risk of developing sarcoid tumours or uveitis of unknown etiology was evaluated in a retrospective study of 16242 equine cases admitted between 1975 and 1987 to the New York State College of Veterinary Medicine Large Animal Hospital, and 3198 equine tissue samples sent to the New York State Veterinary Diagnostic Laboratory between 1977 and 1987. Of 120 sarcoid cases from the Large Animal Hospital, sarcoids were twice as likely to develop in Quarter Horses (odds ratio, OR = 1.8, P less than 0.05) relative to Thoroughbreds and less than half as likely to develop in Standardbreds (OR = 0.2, P less than 0.001) relative to Thoroughbreds. Similarly, of 376 sarcoid cases from the Diagnostic Laboratory, Quarter Horses had a significantly higher risk of developing sarcoid (OR = 2.0, P less than 0.001) relative to Thoroughbreds, while Standardbreds had a significantly lower risk of developing sarcoid (OR = 0.5, P less than 0.05) relative to Thoroughbreds. In the uveitis diagnosis category, Appaloosas had a significantly higher risk of developing uveitis (OR = 6.4, P less than 0.001) relative to Thoroughbreds, while Standardbreds had a significantly lower risk of developing uveitis (OR = 0.4, P less than 0.05) relative to Thoroughbreds.",12,1988-1-1

Uveitis is a complex multifactorial autoimmune disease of the eye characterized by inflammation of the uvea and retina, degeneration of the retina, and blindness in genetically predisposed patients. Using the rat model of experimental autoimmune uveitis (EAU), we previously identified three quantitative trait loci (QTL) associated with EAU on rat chromosomes 4, 12, and 10 (Eau1, Eau2, and Eau3). The primary goal of the current study is to delineate additional non-MHC chromosomal regions that control susceptibility to EAU, and to identify any QTLs that overlap with the QTLs of other autoimmune diseases. Using a set of informative microsatellite markers and F(2) generations of resistant and susceptible MHC class II-matched rat strains (F344 and LEW), we have identified several new significant or suggestive QTLs on rat chromosomes 2, 3, 7, 10, and 19 that control susceptibility to EAU. A protective allele was identified in the susceptible LEW strain in the Eau5 locus at D7Wox18, and epistatic interactions between QTLs were found to influence the severity of disease. The newly identified regions (Eau4 through Eau9) colocalize with the genetic determinants of other autoimmune disease models, and to disease-regulating syntenic regions identified in autoimmune patients on human chromosomes 4q21-31, 5q31-33, 16q22-24, 17p11-q12, 20q11-13, and 22q12-13. Our results suggest that uveitis shares some of the pathogenic mechanisms associated with other autoimmune diseases, and lends support to the ""common gene, common pathway"" hypothesis for autoimmune disorders.",12,2008-May-15

To analyse clinical features, systemic associations, treatment and visual outcomes of uveitis in children and adolescents at a tertiary centre in Tokyo.
METHODS: Clinical records of 64 patients under the age of 20 years who presented between 2001 and 2013 to the Ocular Inflammation Service of the Kyorin Eye Center, Tokyo were reviewed retrospectively.
RESULTS: Of the 64 patients, there was a predominance of girls (70%) and bilateral disease (81%). Mean age at presentation was 12.9 years (4-19 years). Mean follow-up was 46 months (3-144 months). Anterior uveitis was present in 56.3% of patients, panuveitis in 28.1% and posterior uveitis in 15.6%. No patients had intermediate uveitis. The most common diagnostic designation was unclassified uveitis (57.8%). Systemic associations were observed in 10.9% and no patients were diagnosed with juvenile idiopathic arthritis. Ocular complications were observed in 71.9% of patients, including optic disc hyperemia/oedema (40.6%), vitreous opacification (23.4%), posterior synechia (18.7%), increased intraocular pressure (17.1%) and cataract (14.1%). Six patients underwent intraocular surgery, five for cataract extraction and two for glaucoma control. Twelve patients (18.7%) received some form of systemic therapy either corticosteroids, immunosuppressive drugs or biologic agents. The percentage of eyes with a visual acuity of 1.0 or better was 87.1% at baseline, 91.3% at 6 months, 89.6% at 12 months and 87.5% at 36 months.
CONCLUSIONS: The majority of children and adolescents who presented to us with uveitis had bilateral disease and no systemic disease associations. Only one-fifth of patients required systemic therapy to control their ocular inflammation, and most eyes had a good visual outcome.",12,2017-Apr-1

To determine the effect of steroid treatment on visual outcome and ocular complications in patients with presumed ocular tuberculosis.
METHODS: Retrospective review of patients with presumptive ocular tuberculosis. The clinical diagnosis was made based on ocular findings, positive purified protein derivative (PPD) testing of more than 15 mm induration, exclusion of other causes of uveitis and positive ocular response to anti-tuberculous therapy (ATT) within 4 weeks. Group 1 included patients who had received oral prednisone or subtenon injection of triamcinolone acetonide prior to ATT. Group 2 included patients who did not receive corticosteroid therapy prior to administration of ATT.
RESULTS:   Among 500 consecutive new cases of uveitis encountered in 1997-2007 there were 49 (10%) patients with presumed ocular tuberculosis. These comprised 28 (57%) male and 21 (43%) female patients with a mean age of 45 years (range 12-76 years). Four (20%) patients in group 1 had initial visual acuity of 20/40 or better, in comparison to eight (28%) patients in group 2. At 1-year follow-up, six (30%) patients in group 1 had a visual acuity of 20/40 or better compared with 20 (69%) patients in group 2 (p = 0.007). Of 20 eyes (26%) in group 1 that had visual acuity of < 20/50 at 1-year follow up, 14 (70%) eyes developed severe chorioretinal lesion (p = 0.019).
CONCLUSION: Early administration of corticosteroids without anti-tuberculous therapy in presumed ocular tuberculosis may lead to poor visual outcome compared with patients who did not receive corticosteroids prior to presentation. Furthermore, the severity of chorioretinitis lesion in the group of patients given corticosteroid prior to ATT may account for the poor visual outcome.",12,2010-Dec-1

To determine patterns of exacerbations of recurrent non-infectious uveitis during pregnancy and puerperium.
DESIGN: Retrospective cohort study.
METHODS: The medical records of 32 women with a history of chronic non-infectious uveitis, who were pregnant during their follow-up at the Ocular Immunology and Uveitis Service of the Massachusetts Eye and Ear Infirmary, from 1983 through 2003, were reviewed. The uveitis relapse rate during pregnancy was compared to the relapse rate during pregnancy-free periods in these women and to the relapse rate in a control group of women of childbearing age with recurrent non-infectious uveitis.
RESULTS: Among the 32 women who were pregnant during follow-up (40 pregnancies), the rate of flare-ups during pregnancy (1.0 recurrence per year) was lower than that observed during non-pregnant periods (2.4 per year; p<0.001) and lower than that observed in the non-pregnant control group (3.1 per year; p<0.001). Flare-ups were most frequent in the first trimester of pregnancy and decreased markedly in the second and third trimesters (2.3, 0.5, and 0.4 recurrences per year, respectively; p<0.001).
CONCLUSIONS: Pregnancy is associated with lower numbers of flare-ups of non-infectious uveitis compared to the non-pregnant state. If flare-ups do occur during pregnancy, they happen predominantly in the first trimester.",12,2006-Apr-1

To determine the aetiology and clinical characteristics of patients with uveitis in a tertiary ophthalmology centre in northern Thailand.
METHODS: Standard ophthalmological examination and laboratory screening blood tests were performed in 200 consecutive new patients with uveitis. Patients were classified according to the location and aetiology of the uveitis. Specific clinical characteristics were recorded.
DESIGN: Prospective case series.
RESULTS: The case series included 106 male and 94 female patients with a mean age of 38 years. HIV-associated uveitis was noted in 31% (62/200), and included mostly patients with cytomegalovirus retinitis (85%, 53/62). In the non-HIV group, the most common anatomical type was anterior uveitis (34%, 47/138). Infectious uveitis was diagnosed in 22% (30/138) of non-HIV patients, and toxoplasmosis was the most common infection (12/138, 8.7%). The most common non-infectious clinical entities were Vogt-Koyanagi-Harada disease (20%, 22/108) and HLA-B27-associated acute anterior uveitis (9%, 10/108).
CONCLUSIONS: The spectrum of uveitis in northern Thailand included 27% of HIV-infected patients with cytomegalovirus retinitis. Causes of non-HIV uveitis were similar to those often observed in the Far East, but the specific prevalences of these disorders were distinct from that found in India and Japan.",12,2008-Apr-1

  To identify the clinical ocular signs of uveitis associated with latent tuberculosis.
DESIGN:   Retrospective case-control study.
PARTICIPANTS:   Consecutive patients from Singapore National Eye Centre Uveitis over 9 years. Sixty-two patients with uveitis associated with latent tuberculosis were compared with 72 matched controls diagnosed with other known uveitides.
METHODS:   Patients were categorized as: (A) predominantly anterior segment inflammation (anterior uveitides) and (B) predominantly posterior segment inflammation (intermediate, posterior or pan-uveitides). The diagnostic performance of combining these clinical signs with investigations such as interferon-gamma release assay positivity and chest X-ray results suggestive of pulmonary tuberculosis was done using area under the receiver operator characteristic curve.
MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES:   Sensitivity, specificity and likelihood of association with tuberculosis of various clinical signs.
RESULTS:   Extensive posterior synechiae and concomitant anterior scleritis in Group A; low-grade anterior chamber activity, retinal phlebitis and severe vitritis in Group B were significantly associated with latent tuberculosis. Combining these clinical signs with a positive interferon-gamma release assay and tuberculin skin test improved the diagnostic performance in both groups (area under the receiver operator characteristic curve for Group A = 0.779; Group B = 0.789).
CONCLUSION:   Patients with a combination of suggestive clinical signs with positive interferon-gamma release assay and tuberculin skin test are more likely to be accurately diagnosed with uveitis associated with latent tuberculosis, which responds to anti-tuberculosis therapy.",12,2012-1-1

To assess the long-term outcomes of phacoemulsification and intraocular lens (IOL) implantation in eyes with uveitis.
METHODS: One hundred and five eyes of 81 patients, who underwent phacoemulsification and IOL implantation between January 2009 and July 2016, were included in this study. The demographic data, preoperative clinical findings, postoperative outcomes, and intraoperative and postoperative complications were recorded. All collected data and risk factors with regard to visual prognosis were analyzed with the help of the Statistical Package for the Social Sciences version 20.0 software program (IBM Corp., Armonk, NY, USA).
RESULTS: During follow-up (mean: 35.2 ± 22.2 months), corrected distance visual acuity (CDVA) improved in 87.7% of all eyes and reached a level of 0.3 LogMAR or greater in 61.3% of eyes. Postoperative complications included posterior capsule opacification (50.9%), posterior synechiae (21.7%), cystoid macular edema (16%), epiretinal membrane (13.2%), glaucoma (11.3%), increased intraocular pressure (8.5%), and severe inflammation (6.6%). Uveitis recurred in 55.7% of all eyes. The risk for the development of cystoid macular edema was found to be associated with recurrence in the early postoperative period. Low visual acuity risk was 11.1-fold higher with macular scarring (p = 0.001) and 14-fold higher with optic atrophy (p < 0.001), respectively.
CONCLUSIONS: With appropriate management during the pre- and postoperative periods, phacoemulsification and IOL implantation surgery can be safe and effective in eyes with uveitis. However, great caution must be taken to prevent complications both before and after the surgery.",12,2020-Mar-17

Anterior uveitis is a common inflammatory ocular disease characterised by protein accumulation and leucocyte infiltration in the anterior chamber. The aim of this study was to determine the expression of gelatinases in the aqueous humour (AH) and uvea in an animal model of endotoxin induced uveitis (EIU).
METHODS: EIU was established in Lewis rats following an intraperitoneal injection of lipopolysaccharide (LPS). AH and ocular tissue were obtained from control animals and those with EIU over a 1 week time course and the samples analysed immunohistochemically and by gelatin zymography.
RESULTS: Matrix metalloproteinase (MMP) 2 and 9 levels were elevated in rat AH over a 1 week time course. MMP-2 and MMP-9 levels peaked at the time of maximum uveal inflammation, before returning to baseline levels as the inflammation subsided. MMP-9 was detected in the latent and functionally active form. Total protein extracted from inflamed rat uveal tissue displayed no significant gelatinolytic modulation throughout the time course of EIU. Anterior chamber neutrophils and ciliary body epithelial cells were the most abundant source of the gelatinases.
CONCLUSION: This study has revealed a correlation between infiltrating neutrophils and the presence of elevated gelatinases in EIU. The results suggest that these proteolytically active enzymes may be important mediators of the inflammatory response and contribute to matrix remodelling observed in uveitis. Furthermore, the excess production of MMPs may be a mechanism by which leucocytes, such as neutrophils, gain access to uveal tissue and AH. Therapeutic strategies aimed at reducing MMP activity may be of some benefit in the treatment of uveitis.",12,2002-Mar-1

Laser flare photometry is a new quantitative method for evaluating aqueous flare, making flare the only inflammatory parameter that can be evaluated precisely and objectively. The validity of the method already has been demonstrated in anterior segment inflammation. The aim of this study is to assess the validity and limitations of the method to quantify and monitor inflammation in uveitis with predominant involvement of the posterior segment.
METHODS: Five well-defined conditions with uveitis predominant in the posterior segment were analyzed in this study: Behçet uveitis, pars planitis, posterior sarcoidosis, posterior pole toxoplasmosis, and birdshot chorioretinopathy. (1) Mean initial (pretreatment) flare was determined; (2) in the patients needing systemic steroid therapy, introduction of therapy was correlated with evoluting laser flare photometry; and (3) in patients with quiescent disease, the predictive value of a defined subclinical photometry-detected flare rise for disease recrudescence was analyzed.
RESULTS: Initial pretreatment flare was 331.8 +/- 47.7 photon counts per millisecond (ph/msecond) (mean +/- standard error of the mean) for Behçet uveitis, 15.6 +/- 1.3 ph/msecond for pars planitis, 26.9 +/- 4.6 ph/msecond for posterior sarcoidosis, 7.5 +/- 1.0 ph/msecond for posterior pole toxoplasmosis, 5.8 +/- 0.7 ph/msecond for birdshot chorioretinopathy, and 4.7 +/- 0.1 ph/msecond for a group of 88 control eyes. A significant flare reduction after start of steroid therapy was seen in Behçet uveitis (78% reduction), sarcoidosis (44.8%), and pars planitis (51%), but not in toxoplasmosis or in birdshot. A small flare rise had a predictive value for disease recrudescence in 27/35 patients (predictive value, 0.77; sensitivity rate, 100%). The level of associated blood-aqueous barrier disruption for reliable follow-up of posterior uveitis was empirically determined to be 13 to 15 ph/msecond.
CONCLUSION: Laser flare photometry was found to be very sensitive to monitor inflammation in uveitis of the posterior segment as long as a sufficient level of associated blood-aqueous barrier disruption (flare) was present.",12,1995-Apr-1

Human herpesvirus 6 (HHV-6), which is usually responsible for exanthem subitum in children, can reactivate from its latent form after primary infection. It has been implicated in hepatitis, pneumonitis, retinitis and severe infections of the central nervous system in both immunosuppressed and immunocompetent patients. However, involvement of HHV-6 in these infections has not yet been clearly demonstrated. We report the case of a patient presenting a bilateral uveitis from whom HHV-6 was isolated in both aqueous fluid and cerebrospinal fluid (CSF). No other pathogenic agents were found. Diagnosis by polymerase chain reaction (PCR) followed by sequencing of part of the genome revealed the presence of HHV-6 in both aqueous fluid and CSF. Serum IgM and IgG HHV-6 antibodies were significantly elevated in two successive examinations by immunofluorescence. Patient recovery following antiviral therapy suggested that a protocol based on foscarnet followed by ganciclovir was effective. HHV-6 may be responsible for uveo-meningitis. Diagnosis by PCR analysis is essential to identify HHV-6 and to initiate a specific antiviral therapy as fast as possible.",12,2007-Apr-1

The regulation of expression of the arginine-recycling enzymes and arginase isoforms in association with inducible nitric oxide synthase (iNOS) in the eye of endotoxin-induced uveitis (EIU) rats is investigated. An animal model of EIU was created in Wistar rats by intravitreal injection of lipopolysaccharide (LPS). mRNAs for argininosuccinate synthase (AS) and arginase I as well as for iNOS, measured by semi-quantitative reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR), were induced in the eye of EIU rats. iNOS mRNA increased markedly 3 hr after injection, reached a maximum at 6-12 hr, and then decreased at 24 hr. AS mRNA remained little change at 3 hr and increased maximally at 6 hr (by about 3.3-fold), whereas arginase I mRNA increased later and reached a maximum at 12 hr (by about 4.2-fold). iNOS, AS, and arginase I proteins were also induced. AL and arginase II mRNAs remained little changed. In immunohistochemical analysis, iNOS, AS and arginase I were almost colocalized in infiltrated inflammatory cells in the vitreous, iris, ciliary body and inner layers of the retina. In conclusion, AS and arginase I are coinduced with iNOS in infiltrated inflammatory cells in the eyes of EIU rats, and may regulate NO production by changing intracellular concentration of arginine.",12,2002-Dec-1

To compare rates of visual field (VF) loss in uveitis patients with glaucoma against patients with primary open-angle glaucoma (POAG) and explore the association between intraocular pressure (IOP) and rate of VF loss.
DESIGN: Retrospective cohort study.
METHODS: Anonymized VFs and IOP measurements extracted from the electronic medical records of 5 regionally different glaucoma clinics in England. A total of 205 eyes with diagnosis of uveitis plus glaucoma were compared with 4600 eyes with POAG only. Minimum inclusion criteria were ≥4 visits within a 4-year window. Relative risk (RR) of being a ""rapid progressor"" (mean deviation [MD] loss ≥1.5 dB/year) was calculated. A mixed-effects model (MEM) and a pointwise VF progression analysis of pattern deviation were used to confirm differences between the groups. Longitudinal IOP mean, range, and variability were compared with rate of VF progression.
RESULTS: Median (interquartile range) baseline MD in the uveitis and POAG groups was -3.8 (-8.7, -1.5) dB and -3.1 (-6.6, -1.2) dB, respectively. The uveitis and POAG groups had 23 of 205 (11%) and 331 of 4600 (7%) ""rapidly progressing"" eyes, respectively. Age-adjusted RR for ""rapid progression"" in uveitic vs POAG eyes was 1.9 (95% confidence interval: 1.8-2.0). The MEM confirmed that uveitic eyes (-0.49 dB/year) showed higher rates of VF progression than the POAG group (-0.37 dB/year; P < .01). IOP range and variability were higher in the ""rapidly progressing"" uveitic eyes.
CONCLUSIONS: Our analysis suggests that VF loss occurs faster in glaucoma patients with uveitis than those without uveitis. The risk of progressing rapidly in glaucoma with uveitis is almost double than in those without uveitis. Early identification of ""rapid progressors"" may enable targeted intervention to preserve visual function in this high-risk group.",12,2019-Nov-1

Dendritic cells (DCs) act as a bridge between innate and adoptive immunity. They are widely distributed in various tissues and organs. Resident ocular DCs are found in the peripheral margins and juxtapapillary areas of the retina, usually in an immature state. During inflammation, DCs are activated and participate in the development of uveitis, an ocular inflammatory disease. Herein, the characteristics and status of DCs in uveitis, the possible factors affecting the status of DCs, and the clinical methods for detecting the DCs in patients are described.",12,2019-May-1

The purpose of this study was to determine levels of the cytokines IL-1β, IL-6, IL-21, IL-22, and IL-23 and the chemokines CXCL13, CCL19, CCL20, and CCL21 in aqueous humor (AH) samples from patients with specific uveitic entities.
METHODS: Paired serum samples (n = 13) and AH samples (n = 111) from patients with active idiopathic granulomatous uveitis (IGU) or with uveitis associated with HLA-B27-related inflammation, Behçet's disease (BD), Vogt-Koyanagi-Harada (VKH) disease, or sarcoidosis and control patients were analyzed in two different multiplex assays.
RESULTS: Cytokines IL-1β, IL-21, IL-22, and IL-23 were not detected in any AH sample. Chemokine CCL21 concentrations in serum were significantly higher than those in AH. CCL19 levels in AH and serum were not significantly different. Levels of CCL20 and CXCL13 in AH were significantly higher than those in serum. IL-6 was not detected in serum samples. IL-6 AH levels were significantly higher in patients with HLA-B27-associated uveitis and in BD patients than in patients with VKH disease, sarcoidosis, and IGU (P < 0.0001). CCL20 AH levels were significantly higher in HLA-B27-associated uveitis than in BD, VKH, sarcoidosis, and IGU (P = 0.001), whereas CXCL13 AH levels were significantly higher in VKH disease and IGU than in HLA-B27-associated uveitis, BD, and sarcoidosis (P = 0.007).
CONCLUSIONS: IL-6-driven immune responses are more potent in HLA-B27-associated uveitis and BD than in VKH disease, sarcoidosis, and IGU. CCL20 appears to be a specific biomarker of HLA-B27-associated uveitis, whereas CXCL13 appears to be a biomarker of VKH disease and IGU. Our findings suggest that IL-6, CCL20, and CXCL13 could serve as drug targets for treatment of specific clinical entities of endogenous uveitis.",12,2016-Sep-01

Joint and ocular involvement have been characterized by several cohort studies but only very little data are available on skin lesions.
OBJECTIVES: We aimed to provide a detailed clinical and microscopic analysis of skin manifestations and to study whether they may contribute to an early diagnosis.
METHODS: We conducted a retrospective multicentre study in a French cohort of 21 patients diagnosed with genetically confirmed BS.
RESULTS: Skin involvement was the first clinical manifestation of BS in 15/16 patients with dermatological manifestations. The presence of skin lesions was associated with significant shorter age at diagnosis (P = 0.03) and diagnostic delay (P = 0.04). Dermatological assessment allowed an earlier diagnosis (P = 0.001) and reduces the diagnostic delay (P = 0.007). Early skin lesions had a homogeneous, stereotypical clinical presentation, namely non-confluent erythematous or pigmented millimetric papules in 13/14(93%) patients. In contrast, skin lesions occurring during later disease stages had a more heterogeneous clinical presentation, including ichthyosiform dermatosis, panniculitis, livedoid lesions and vasculitis. Whatever their time of occurrence and the clinical aspect, all biopsied showed histologically presence of granuloma.
CONCLUSION: Skin involvement in BS is the earliest clinical manifestation of the BS in the large majority of patients. The recognition of dermatological manifestations as granulomatous skin lesions and early dermatological expertise are the key to an early diagnosis of BS. In view of our results, it seems reasonable to propose a simplified view of skin lesions of BS in which the granuloma is the key structure.",12,2020-Feb-1

Noninfectious uveitis is characterized by a dysregulated inflammatory or immune response in the eye. It is unclear whether this represents a failure of immune privilege or an overwhelming inflammatory drive that has exceeded the capacity of regulatory mechanisms that are still functioning. The authors investigated immune regulation in the human eye during intraocular inflammation (uveitis) and its impact on dendritic cell (DC) function and subsequent T-cell responses.
METHODS: Myeloid DCs were isolated from the aqueous humor (AqH) and peripheral blood of patients with active uveitis and characterized by flow cytometry. The effect of uveitis AqH was interrogated in an in vitro model of peripheral blood monocyte-derived DCs from healthy controls.
RESULTS: Myeloid DCs isolated from uveitic AqH were characterized by elevated major histocompatibility complex classes I and II (MHC I/II), but reduced CD86 compared with matched peripheral blood DCs. Exposure of peripheral blood monocyte-derived DCs from healthy controls to the inflammatory AqH supernatant recapitulated this phenotype. Despite interferon gamma (IFNγ)-dependent upregulation of MHC I, inflammatory AqH was overall suppressive to DC function, with reduced CD86 expression and diminished T-cell responses. This suppressive effect was equal to or greater than that induced by noninflammatory AqH, but was glucocorticoid independent (in contrast to noninflammatory AqH).
CONCLUSIONS: These data indicate that the ocular microenvironment continues to regulate DC function during uveitis, despite IFNγ-driven upregulation of MHC expression, supporting the hypothesis that immune regulation within the eye is maintained during inflammation.",12,2012-Feb-1

Dying cells release pro-inflammatory molecules, functioning as cytokines to trigger cell/tissue inflammation that is relevant to disease pathology. Heat-shock protein 90 (HSP90) is believed to act as a danger signal for tissue damage once released extracellularly. Potential roles of HSP90 were explored in retinal pigment epithelial (RPE) inflammatory responses to necrosis. Cellular extracts can trigger ARPE-19 cell inflammatory responses, producing cytokines that lead to an increase in ARPE-19 cell monolayer permeability. Addition of recombinant HSP90β mimics the induction of chemokines IL-8 and MCP-1 in cultured RPE cells, suggesting that released HSP90 can incite RPE cell sterile inflammatory responses. Consistent with this, classical HSP90 inhibitors were shown to substantially reduce necrosis-induced cytokine production and permeability increases in ARPE-19 cells. Moreover, a cell-impermeable inhibitor, 17-N,N-dimethylaminoethylamino-17-demethoxy-geldanamycin-N-oxide, also efficiently inhibited necrosis-induced cytokine production and TNF-α/IL-1β-induced increase in ARPE-19 cell permeability in vitro and endotoxin-induced development of uveitis in vivo, suggesting that HSP90 can contribute to necrosis-induced RPE inflammatory responses. Collectively, our data identify HSP90 as a pro-inflammatory molecule in RPE cell sterile inflammatory responses.",12,2011-Dec-1

Publication Date: 2004-Sep-1
PMID: 15385194
To review the published laboratory and clinical studies pertaining to the efficacy of corticosteroids in the treatment of intraocular inflammation.
METHODS: A Pubmed computer search was conducted of all publications focusing on the efficacy of corticosteroids in treating ocular inflammation, with an additional search of pertinent citations culled from these articles.
RESULTS: Experimental evidence has established the efficacy of corticosteroid eyedrops in treating intraocular inflammation. The effectiveness of periocular corticosteroid injections as well as of systemic corticosteroids is supported by extensive clinical experience, although placebo-controlled trials are lacking. Few studies have documented differences in efficacy between the common corticosteroid agents or between the different routes of administration. Subconjunctival injection appears to achieve higher intraocular corticosteroid levels than do other routes of periocular injection or systemic therapy. Clinical experience with intravitreous corticosteroid injection is insufficient to firmly attest to its efficacy or safety.
CONCLUSION: The efficacy of corticosteroids in treating intraocular inflammation is based on limited experimental evidence and considerable clinical experience.",12,2004-Sep-1

Ocular involvement with acute Epstein-Barr virus infection is usually limited to a transient follicular conjunctivitis, although other lesions have been reported. Chronic Epstein-Barr virus infection has recently gained attention, but ocular manifestations have not been emphasized. We describe three patients with chronic infection with prominent ocular involvement. Bilateral uveitis was noted in all patients, ranging from an anterior uveitis that was responsive to steroids to a severe panuveitis with vitritis, cataract, optic disc swelling, and macular edema. In one patient, topical acyclovir ointment resulted in a substantial decrease in the inflammatory reaction when added to systemic acyclovir therapy. Another patient displayed a keratitis that resolved with topical steroid therapy. Cataract and vitreous surgery were also beneficial in the management of these patients.",12,1987-Jun-1

Retinal vasculitis and vein occlusions are common causes of serious visual loss in Behçet's disease. We aimed to evaluate the optical coherence tomography angiography (OCTA) findings of Behcet uveitis (BU) patients.
METHODS: We evaluated 32 eyes of 16 patients with BU and 30 eyes of 15 healthy controls. Superficial capillary plexus (SCP) and deeper capillary plexuses (DCP) were evaluated using OCTA RTVue XR AVANTI.
RESULTS: On SCP, nonperfusion/hypoperfusion areas (NPA) were seen in 10 eyes, perifoveal capillary arcade disruption (PCAD) was seen in 10 eyes, capillary network disorganization (CND) was seen in 7 eyes and intraretinal cystoid spaces (ICS) were seen in 2 eyes. On DCP, NPA were seen in 13 eyes, PCAD was seen in 11 eyes, CND was seen in 7 eyes and ICS were seen in 4 eyes.
CONCLUSION: We showed that DCP were affected more than SCP in these patients. In addition, capillary vessel density of BU group was significantly lower than control group.",12,2019-Oct-1

Liposome preparations of FK506 improve the penetration of topically administered drug into the aqueous humor. The purpose of the experiment was to compare topically administered highdose oil-dissolved FK506 (OD-FK506) and low-dose liposome-bound FK506 (LB-506) for the treatment of endotoxin-induced uveitis (EIU).
METHODS: Endotoxin-induced uveitis was produced in female Lewis rats with Salmonella typhimurium endotoxin. Four hours prior to endotoxin injection, one eye received 20 mul eyedrops every four hours containing either high-dose OD-FK506 at 3 mg/ml (N = 20), low-dose LB-FK506 at 0.16 mg/ml (N = 19), prednisolone acetate 1% (N = 20), or empty liposomes (N = 20). Eyes were enucleated 24 hours after endotoxin injection and inflammatory cells were counted on histologic sections by two masked observers.
RESULTS: The mean number of infiltrating inflammatory cells per section +/- S.E.M. was 127.8 +/- 20.1, 76.8 +/- 16.7, 75.0 +/- 19.1, and 3.6 +/- 0.4 for animals treated with empty liposomes, LB-FK506, OD-FK506, and prednisolone acetate, respectively. The difference in inflammation between the empty liposome controls and the LB-FK506- and OD-FK506-treated animals was statistically significant (p = 0.03 and p = 0.02, respectively). The difference in inflammation between the high-dose OD-FK506- and low-dose LB-FK506-treated animals was not statistically significant (0 = 0.94).
CONCLUSION: In this study, low-dose LB-FK506 and high-dose (OD-FK506) were both effective in inhibiting EIU. Higher concentrations of LB-FK506 are being developed and should augment the therapeutic effect of topical FK506.",12,1998-Mar-1

Dendritic cells (DCs) are a heterogeneous population. Murine DCs consist of conventional DCs (cDCs) and plasmacytoid DCs (pDCs). In humans, the analogous populations are myeloid DCs (mDCs) and pDCs. Though distinct in phenotypes and functions, studies have shown that these DC subsets may interact or ""crosstalk"" during immune responses. For example, cDCs may facilitate pDC maturation, and pDCs may enhance antigen presentation of cDCs in certain pathogenic conditions or even take on a cDC phenotype themselves. The role of DCs in noninfectious uveitis has been studied primarily in the experimental autoimmune uveitis mouse model and to a more limited extent in patients. Recent evidence shows that the number, phenotype, and function of DC subsets are altered in this disease. We provide an overview of selected recent developments of pDCs and cDCs/mDCs, with special attention to their interaction and the dual roles of DC subsets in noninfectious uveitis.",12,2015-1-1

To describe the occurrence of spontaneous cataract absorption in patients with leptospiral uveitis.
METHODS: The records of patients with seropositive leptospiral uveitis seen in the uveitis clinic at Aravind Eye Hospital between January 1994 and December 1997 were reviewed retrospectively.
RESULTS: During the 4 years of the study, 394 eyes of 276 patients with seropositive leptospiral uveitis were identified. Of these, 54 eyes (13.7%) of 41 patients (14.9%) had a final visual acuity of 20/40 or worse attributable to cataract formation. Of these 54 eyes, 41 eyes (75.9%) had visually significant cataract on their first visit to the uveitis clinic, and 13 eyes (24.1%) were noted to have cataract 1-6 months after presentation. Spontaneous absorption was observed in 10 eyes (18.5%) of eight patients (19.5%), and occurred from 6 weeks to 18 months, with a median of 5 months, after the onset of cataract. Of 12 035 consecutive, non-leptospiral, non-traumatic, uveitic, control patients seen during the same 4 years of the study, none showed spontaneous cataract absorption.
CONCLUSION: Spontaneous cataract absorption occurs in a significant number of patients with leptospiral uveitis, and appears to be unique to this form of non-traumatic uveitis.",12,2000-Oct-1

This study documents the examination of 17 horses (both sexes, 3-18 years old) suffering from spontaneous equine recurrent uveitis (ERU). Vitreal samples obtained by pars plana vitrectomy were examined macroscopically and ultrastructurally, and in most cases also by cultural examination, by microscopic agglutination test (MAT) and by polymerase chain reaction. In 24% (4/17) of the animals, ultrastructural examination by electron microscopy revealed intact leptospiral bacteria in the vitreous. The leptospires were detected freely in the vitreous and also incorporated by a phagocyte. They were surrounded by a rim of proteinaceous material which was reduced around a phagocytosed leptospira. Ninety-four per cent (16/17) of the vitreal samples presented significant antibody levels in the MAT, mostly against leptospiral serovar Grippotyphosa. Seventy-five per cent (9/12) of bacterial culture examinations were positive for leptospira. Polymerase chain reaction was positive in all (16/16) examinations performed. Our findings support previous reports suggesting that leptospires play an important role in the pathogenesis of ERU. Interestingly, this study found leptospires after secondary and later acute episodes. A persistent leptospiral infection is therefore suggested as the cause of ERU.",12,2007-Jun-1

Long term followup in 52 uveitis patients treated with Cyclosporine (CsA) is presented here. The patients included in this study all had intermediate or posterior uveitis of noninfectious etiology; and all were considered therapeutic failures to systemic corticosteroids and/or cytotoxic agents. Patients were considered a therapeutic success if the visual acuity in either eye improved two lines or more and/or the vitreal haze improved more than two grading levels. While five patients stopped therapy before the three month interval, 41 of 52 patients or 79% were therapeutic successes at three months after the initiation of CsA as the sole systemic immunosuppressive agent for their disease. Twenty-five of a potential 35 patients (71%) remained on CsA after one year's time, with 63% (22/35) of these individuals receiving the medication considered a therapeutic success. The patients who appeared to respond particularly well to CsA therapy were those with pars planitis, intermediate uveitis of the non-pars planitis type, VKH, and Behcet's disease. In vitro S-antigen (S-Ag) testing did not appear to have a predictive value in determining which patients would be therapeutic successes (improvement in visual acuity), however the S-Ag responder group did appear to have a statistically greater improvement in vitreal haze. Renal toxicity was by far the most common adverse effect, which we have found to be reversible with our approach to therapy. However, adverse reactions required a reduction in CsA dosage in some patients, making it not feasible to maintain therapeutically effective CsA levels. In those patients, low dose prednisone was added to these patients' CsA regimens with generally good results. We did not observe opportunistic infections nor CsA associated neoplasms in our patients. This long term study demonstrates the potential efficacy of CsA in the treatment of severe intra-ocular inflammatory disorders. However, we firmly believe that only in the context of a randomized clinical trial that a definitive evaluation as to the true effectiveness of CsA will be reached.",12,1985-1-1

To analyze the efficacy of tocilizumab in uveitic macular edema (ME) resistant to various immunomodulatory drugs.
METHODS: Patients received tocilizumab every 4 weeks intravenously. Central foveal thickness (CFT) was assessed by optical coherence tomography (OCT).
RESULTS: Five patients (8 eyes) who were ineffectively pretreated with systemic prednisolone, at least one immunosuppressive drug, and at least one biologic drug for uveitic macular edema were included in the study. At 3 months, a response of ME (≥25% reduction in CFT) was observed in 6 eyes (75.0%) of 5 patients. During follow-up, complete resolution of ME was achieved in 5 eyes (62.5%) of 4 patients. Improvement of BCVA was observed in 3 eyes of 3 patients, and stabilization in 3 eyes of 3 patients. Tocilizumab was well tolerated, and no severe side effects occurred.

Sarcoidosis is one of the leading causes of inflammatory eye disease. Any part of the eye and its adnexal tissues can be involved. Uveitis and optic neuropathy are the main manifestations, which may require systemic treatment. Two groups of patients with sarcoid uveitis can be distinguished: one of either sex and any ethnicity in which ophthalmological findings are various and another group of elderly Caucasian women with mostly chronic posterior uveitis. Clinically isolated uveitis revealing sarcoidosis remains a strictly ocular condition in a large majority of cases. Although it can be a serious condition involving functional prognosis, early recognition in addition to a growing therapeutic arsenal (including intravitreal implant) has improved the visual prognosis of the disease in recent years. Systemic corticosteroids are indicated when uveitis does not respond to topical corticosteroids or when there is bilateral posterior involvement, especially macular edema. In up to 30% of the cases that require an unacceptable dosage of corticosteroids to maintain remission, additional immunosuppression is used, especially methotrexate. As with other forms of severe noninfectious uveitis, monoclonal antibodies against tumor necrosis factor-α have been used. However, only very rarely does sarcoid uveitis fail to respond to combined corticosteroids and methotrexate therapy, a situation that should suggest either poor adherence or another granulomatous disease. Optic neuropathy often affects women of African and Caribbean origins. Some authors recommend that patients should be treated with high-dose of corticosteroids and concurrent immunosuppression from the onset of this manifestation, which is associated with a poorer outcome.",12,2020-Oct-1

To evaluate long-term efficacy and safety of extended treatment with adalimumab in patients with noninfectious intermediate, posterior, or panuveitis.
DESIGN: Open-label, multicenter, phase 3 extension study (VISUAL III).
PARTICIPANTS: Adults who had completed a randomized, placebo-controlled phase 3 parent trial (VISUAL I or II) without treatment failure (inactive uveitis) or who discontinued the study after meeting treatment failure criteria (active uveitis).
METHODS: Patients received subcutaneous adalimumab 40 mg every other week. Data were collected for ≤ 362 weeks. Adverse events (AEs) were recorded until 70 days after the last dose.
MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Long-term safety and quiescence; other efficacy variables included inflammatory lesions, anterior chamber cell and vitreous haze grade, macular edema, visual acuity, and dose of uveitis-related systemic corticosteroids.
RESULTS: At study entry, 67% of patients (283/424) showed active uveitis and 33% (141/424) showed inactive uveitis; 60 patients subsequently met exclusion criteria, and 364 were included in the intention-to-treat analysis. Efficacy variables were analyzed through week 150, when approximately 50% of patients (214/424) remained in the study. Patients showing quiescence increased from 34% (122/364) at week 0 to 85% (153/180) at week 150. Corticosteroid-free quiescence was achieved by 54% (66/123) and 89% (51/57) of patients with active or inactive uveitis at study entry. Mean daily dose of systemic corticosteroids was reduced from 9.4 ± 17.1 mg/day at week 0 (n = 359) to 1.5 ± 3.9 mg/day at week 150 (n = 181). The percentage of patients who achieved other efficacy variables increased over time for those with active uveitis at study entry and was maintained for those with inactive uveitis. The most frequently reported treatment-emergent AEs of special interest were infections (n = 275; 79 events/100 patient-years [PY]); AEs and serious AEs occurred at a rate of 396 events/100 PY and 15 events/100 PY, respectively.
CONCLUSIONS: Long-term treatment with adalimumab led to quiescence and reduced corticosteroid use for patients who entered VISUAL III with active uveitis and led to maintenance of quiescence for those with inactive uveitis. AEs were comparable with those reported in the parent trials and consistent with the known safety profile of adalimumab.",12,2021-Jun-1

To report the characteristics of a case series of ocular inflammatory events following COVID-19 vaccination in Japan.
STUDY DESIGN: Retrospective multicenter study METHODS: In this retrospective multicenter survey, a questionnaire was sent to 16 Japanese hospitals that had uveitis specialty clinics. Information on patients who developed ocular inflammatory events within 14 days of COVID-19 vaccination between February 2021 and December 2021 was collected.
RESULTS: Thirty-seven patients were diagnosed with ocular inflammatory events following COVID-19 vaccination. The mean age was 53.4 ± 16.4 years (range, 26-86 years), and the mean time to onset after vaccination was 6.3 ± 4.2 days (range, 1-14 days). Vogt-Koyanagi-Harada disease (VKH) was the most common event (n = 17 patients, 46%), followed by anterior uveitis (n = 6), infectious uveitis (n = 3), acute zonal occult outer retinopathy (AZOOR) (n = 2), sarcoidosis-associated uveitis (n = 1), acute posterior multifocal placoid pigment epitheliopathy (APMPPE) (n = 1), optic neuritis (n = 1), multiple evanescent white dot syndrome (MEWDS) (n = 1), Posner-Schlossman syndrome (n = 1), and unclassified uveitis (n = 4). Twenty-eight cases occurred after BNT162b2 vaccination (Pfizer-BioNTech) and 8 after mRNA-1273 vaccination (Moderna), whilst 1 patient had no information about vaccine type.
CONCLUSIONS: COVID-19 vaccination can be related to various types of ocular inflammatory events. When we encounter patients with ocular inflammatory disease, we should consider that it may be an adverse effect of COVID-19 vaccination.",12,2023-Jan-1

This study compares the outcomes of trabeculectomy and Molteno implantation in the treatment of glaucomas associated with uveitis.
METHODS: Forty-five patients with uveitis, who had undergone filtering surgery for glaucomas associated with uveitis, were reviewed retrospectively. Successful outcome was defined as final intraocular pressure (IOP) of 6 to 21 mmHg, with a minimum follow-up of 6 months without visually devastating complications or loss of light perception.
RESULTS: One- and two-year life-table success rates, respectively, were 81% and 73% with trabeculectomy (16 patients); 53% and 31% with combined trabeculectomy and first-stage (reserve) Molteno implantation (19 patients); and 79% and 79% with one-stage Molteno implantation (10 patients). In 11 patients who underwent second-stage Molteno implantation after trabeculectomy failure, 1- and 2-year life-table success rates were 79% and 79%, respectively. Complications included surgically treated choroidal effusions (1/45; 2%), choroidal hemorrhages (3/45; 7%), and chronic hypotony (3/45; 7%). Follow-up in all groups ranged from 5 to 70 months (mean +/- standard deviation, 28 +/- 17 months).
CONCLUSIONS: Trabeculectomy provides surprisingly good results in glaucomas associated with uveitis (modulation of wound healing with antimetabolites probably would afford an even higher success rate). However, when significant, immediate postoperative and/or moderate chronic postoperative inflammation is likely, aqueous drainage devices appear more likely to control IOP.",12,1993-Jun-1

IL-22 is a pro- and anti-inflammatory cytokine that is mainly produced by T cells and NK cells. Recent studies have reported the increased number of IL-22 producing T cells in patients with autoimmune noninfectious uveitis; however, the correlation between IL-22 and uveitis remains unclear. In this study, we aimed to determine the specific role of IL-22 and its receptor in the pathogenesis of uveitis. Serum concentration of IL-22 was significantly increased in uveitis patients. IL-22Rα was expressed in the retinal pigment epithelial cell line, ARPE-19. To examine the effect of IL-22, ARPE-19 was treated with recombinant IL-22. The proliferation of ARPE-19 and the production of monocyte chemoattractant protein (MCP)-1 from ARPE-19 were clearly elevated. IL-22 induced MCP-1 which facilitated the migration of inflammatory cells. Moreover, IL-22 increased the IL-22Rα expression in ARPE-19 through the activation of PI3K/Akt. Experimental animal models of uveitis induced by interphotoreceptor retinoid binding protein 1-20 (IRBP1-20) exhibited elevation of hyperplasia RPE and IL-22 production. When CD4+ T cells from the uveitis patients were stimulated with IRBP1-20, the production of IL-22 definitely increased. In addition, we examine the regulatory role of cysteamine, which has an anti-inflammatory role in the cornea, in uveitis through the down-regulation of IL-22Rα expression. Cysteamine effectively suppressed the IRBP1-20-induced IL-22Rα expression and prevented the development of IRBP1-20-induced uveitis in the experimental animal model. These finding suggest that IL-22 and its receptor have a crucial role in the development and pathogenesis of uveitis by facilitating inflammatory cell infiltration, and that cysteamine may be a useful therapeutic drug in treating uveitis by down-regulating IL-22Rα expression in RPE.",12,2016-1-1

In this review we consider the current evidence base for treatments in inflammatory eye disease, and in particular uveitis, from a historical perspective. We consider the challenges that have traditionally hindered progress in inflammatory eye disease including small target populations, heterogeneous disease groups, poorly defined phenotypes, diagnostic inconsistency, subjective outcome measures, specific issues around visual acuity as an outcome measure and low commercial interest. Strategies to address these issues are considered de novo and with reference to recent advances outside of ophthalmology and highlight the promise for ocular inflammation. Progress in these specialties has included the development of thriving clinical-trial cultures, public-private partnerships, pathogenetic- and structure-led drug design, efficient drug development pipelines, and biomarker-defined treatment protocols enabling personalization of medicine. Although there are challenges, these are exciting opportunities as we seek to develop safe and effective treatments for patients with inflammatory eye disease.",12,2013-Apr-24

Recent studies indicate that ethyl pyruvate (EP) exerts anti-inflammatory properties; however, the effect of EP on ocular inflammation is not known. The efficacy of EP in endotoxin-induced uveitis (EIU) in rats was investigated.
METHODS: EIU in Lewis rats was developed by the subcutaneous injection of lipopolysaccharide (LPS; 150 μg). EP (30 mg/kg body weight) or its carrier was injected intraperitoneally 1 hour before or 2 hours after lipopolysaccharide injection. Animals were killed after 3 and 24 hours followed by enucleation of eyes and collection of the aqueous humor (AqH). The number of infiltrating cells and levels of proteins in the AqH were determined. The rat cytokine/chemokine multiplex method was used to determine level of cytokines and chemokines in the AqH. TNF-α and phospho-nuclear factor kappa B (NF-κB) expression in ocular tissues were determined immunohistochemically. Human primary nonpigmented ciliary epithelial cells (HNPECs) were used to determine the in vitro efficacy of EP on lipopolysaccharide-induced inflammatory response.
RESULTS: Compared to controls, AqH from the EIU rat eyes had a significantly higher number of infiltrating cells, total protein, and inflammatory cytokines/chemokines, and the treatment of EP prevented EIU-induced increases. In addition, EP also prevented the expression of TNF-α and activation of NF-κB in the ciliary bodies and retina of the eye. Moreover, in HNPECs, EP inhibited lipopolysaccharide-induced activation of NF-κB and expression of Cox-2, inducible nitric oxide synthase, and TNF-α.
CONCLUSIONS: Our results indicate that EP prevents ocular inflammation in EIU, suggesting that the supplementation of EP could be a novel approach for the treatment of ocular inflammation, specifically uveitis.",12,2011-Jul-11

Due to continued improvement in lens design, lens manufacturing, and surgical technique, the incidence of complications of cataract surgery with intraocular lens (IOL) implantation have decreased in recent years. Complications may be categorized into operative and postoperative, both early and late onset. Operative complications include posterior capsule rupture with or without vitreous loss, loss of all or part of the lens nucleus, iris damage, and stripping of Descemet's membrane. Early postoperative complications include pupillary block, hyphema, elevation of the intraocular pressure associated with the use of viscoelastic substances, persistent uveitis with or without hypopyon, and endophthalmitis. Late postoperative complications include IOL malposition, secondary glaucoma, cystoid macular edema, retinal detachment, and pseudophakic bullous keratopathy.",12,1989-Feb-1

To identify and describe long-term posterior and anterior segment complications of immune recovery uveitis in patients with inactive cytomegalovirus retinitis who are undergoing highly active antiretroviral therapy-mediated recovery of immune function.
METHODS: A prospective cohort study at a university medical center. Twenty-nine eyes of 21 patients with immune recovery uveitis and inactive cytomegalovirus retinitis were followed for 14.5 to 116 weeks (median, 43 weeks) after diagnosis of immune recovery uveitis.
RESULTS: Nine eyes of nine patients developed visually important complications involving the posterior segment, anterior segment, or a combination of both. Posterior segment complications included severe proliferative vitreoretinopathy in three eyes and spontaneous vitreous hemorrhage from avulsion of a blood vessel secondary to contraction of the inflamed vitreous in one eye. Proliferative vitreoretinopathy recurred in all cases after surgery, severely compromising the visual outcome. Anterior segment complications included posterior subcapsular cataracts with vision decrease in five eyes and persistent anterior chamber inflammation after cataract extraction, resulting in posterior synechiae and large visually important lens deposits in three eyes.
CONCLUSION: Persistent inflammation in immune recovery uveitis may lead to vision-threatening complications, such as proliferative vitreoretinopathy, posterior subcapsular cataracts, and severe postoperative inflammation. Immune recovery uveitis is a chronic inflammatory syndrome that may result in complications months to years after the onset of inflammation.",12,2000-Jul-1

To determine whether HLA-B27 typing helps the clinician in the diagnostic examination of uveitis in a HLA-B27 rich population and also whether the clinical picture of HLA-B27 positive unilateral acute or recurrent anterior uveitis (AAU) is distinguishable from the idiopathic negative form.
METHODS: During a 3 year period 220 consecutive patients with undetermined uveitis at onset were examined in the Helsinki University Eye Clinic. HLA-B27 antigen was tested for 85% of the patients. Other laboratory or x ray examinations were performed on the basis of the anatomical classification of uveitis and the biomicroscopic features characteristic of uveitis associated systemic diseases.
RESULTS: HLA-B27 antigen was found significantly more often in patients with anterior (71%) and acute/recurrent unilateral (79%) uveitis than in patients with intermediate, posterior panuveitis (7%), and chronic (7%) or bilateral (12%) forms. Of the 16 cases of HLA-B27 negative unilateral AAU, five showed biomicroscopic features representing uveitis entities. The remaining 11 cases did not differ in any respect from the cases of HLA-B27 positive unilateral AAU.
CONCLUSION: HLA-B27 antigen helps the clinician in the diagnostic examination of unilateral AAU. Positive test results serve as a clue to search for spondyloarthropathies, and negative results indicate the need to look for specific uveitis entities and other systemic diseases. The occurrence of HLA-B27 positivity in conjunction with uveitis entities other than unilateral AAU is of the same level or less than in the population of Finland in general.",12,2000-Apr-1

To evaluate the long-term outcomes of cataract surgery in children with uveitis.
METHODS: Retrospective, noncomparative review of medical records of children (≤16 years) with uveitic cataract who had undergone cataract surgery between January 2001 and December 2014 at a tertiary care center was done. The main outcome measures were visual acuity and postoperative complications.
RESULTS: We recruited 37 children (58 eyes) who were diagnosed with uveitic cataract and underwent cataract surgery. The etiology of uveitis included juvenile idiopathic arthritis (n = 19), presumed intraocular tuberculosis (n = 8), idiopathic (n = 4), Behçet's disease (n = 2), Vogt-Koyanagi-Harada syndrome (n = 2), human leukocyte antigen B-27 associated uveitis (n = 1), and toxocariasis (n = 1). Phacoemulsification with intraocular lens (IOL) implantation was performed in 17 patients (27 eyes; 46.55%), while 20 patients (31 eyes; 53.44%) were left aphakic after pars plan lensectomy and vitrectomy. At an average follow-up of 3.69 ± 7.2 (SD) years, all cases had significant improvement in corrected distance visual acuity post cataract extraction; visual acuity of 20/40 or more was achieved in 32 eyes (55.17%). The most common complication was capsular opacification (37.93%). Incidence of secondary procedures as well as glaucoma was not statistically different in patients undergoing IOL implantation from those who were aphakic.
CONCLUSION: Even though number of secondary procedures was more in pseudophakic group, meticulous choice of surgical technique and adequate immunosuppression lead to a modest gain of visual acuity in children undergoing IOL implantation in uveitis. However, scrupulous case selection and aggressive control of pre- and postoperative intraocular inflammation are the key factors in the postoperative success of these patients.",12,2019-Apr-1

To assess anterior segment anatomy in uveitis-glaucoma- hyphema syndrome.
DESIGN: Retrospective case series.
METHODS: Nine pseudophakic eyes (nine patients) with complete or incomplete uveitis-glaucoma-hyphema syndrome underwent ultrasound biomicroscopy.
RESULTS: Ultrasound biomicroscopy revealed intraocular lens malposition in each case. Of the eight eyes with posterior chamber intraocular lenses, haptics were in contact with the iris pigment epithelium (four eyes) or the pars plicata (three eyes) or prolapsed into the angle recess near a filtration bleb internal ostium (one eye). All other posterior chamber intraocular lens haptics were located in the ciliary sulcus with the exception of two in the capsular bag. Both haptics in the eye with the anterior chamber intraocular lens had eroded into the ciliary body.
CONCLUSION: By its ability to detect haptic position, ultrasound biomicroscopy can assist in elucidating the cause of uveitis-glaucoma-hyphema syndrome and in deciding on the course of treatment.",12,2002-Jun-1

We perfused enucleated human eyes via the anterior chamber by the constant pressure technique. Infusion of human serum into the anterior chamber of enucleated human eyes for 30 minutes at 23 mm Hg pressure induced a 42% decrease in facility of outflow, which was not relieved by irrigation of the anterior chamber with balanced salt solution or alpha-chymotrypsin. Diluted serum also reduced the facility of outflow. Measured in a glass viscometer, diluted serum had less viscosity than undiluted, but interfered with outflow from the eye more than anticipated on the basis of viscosity alone. When we used lens depression to induce tension on the iridocorneal angle to simulate the effects of contraction of the ciliary muscle, outflow facility increased in control eyes that had not been exposed to serum and in serum-perfused eyes. However, the partial obstruction to outflow that had been induced by serum persisted. Normal serum components may become adsorbed or entrapped in the aqueous outflow system so as to obstruct outflow, and this may result in secondary glaucoma in eyes with chronic uveitis.",12,1978-Jul-1

To review the existing evidence that supports the subconjunctival use of triamcinolone acetonide (TA) in the treatment of various ophthalmic diseases.
METHODS: A literature search was performed for published articles about the pharmacokinetic (PK) and pharmacodynamic characteristics of triamcinolone, as well as its potential ophthalmic use, focused mainly in the subconjunctival mode of delivery. Search terms included corticosteroids, triamcinolone, ocular, subconjunctival, and ophthalmic.
RESULTS: Corticosteroids represent the mainstay of treatment of ocular inflammation, exerting their action by affecting multiple pathways of the inflammatory response, making them particularly effective in the majority of cases. However, due to the number and severity of the side effects associated with their use, they have to be given with caution. Corticosteroids can be given topically, subconjunctivally, intraocularly, and systemically to treat a variety of ocular diseases with specific pharmacological and PK characteristics. Triamcinolone is one of the most widely used corticosteroids in the treatment of ocular inflammation. This glucocorticoid used subconjunctivally was proven to be particularly safe and effective in some common and important inflammatory ophthalmic diseases such as anterior scleritis, uveitis, and corneal graft rejection. Further, there are other indications for its successful use where data exist, but somehow less abundant.
CONCLUSIONS: This article highlights the potential of TA to complement the treatment armamentarium of anterior segment inflammation.",12,2013-1-1

The pathogenesis of acute and recurrent anterior uveitis is poorly understood. Here, recent evidence is presented for the hypothesis that this disease may be associated with activation of receptors of the innate immune system, such as Toll-like receptors, by pathogen associated molecule patterns, such as lipopolysaccharide, derived from triggering gram negative bacteria. Acute anterior uveitis results in ocular tissue damage and the release of endogenous molecules (damage associated molecular patterns), such as heat shock proteins and S100 proteins that can also activate Toll-like receptors and thus perpetuate or reactivate intraocular inflammation.",12,2010-Mar-1

To characterize the intraocular immune cell infiltrate induced by intravitreal adeno-associated virus (AAV) gene therapy.
METHODS: AAV vectors carrying plasmids expressing green fluorescent protein under the control of PR2.1 were injected intravitreally into AAV naive and AAV primed C57Bl/6 mice. Clinical inflammation was assessed using optical coherence tomography. Intraocular immune cell populations were identified and quantified by flow cytometry on days 1, 7, and 29 after intravitreal injection and compared with sham and fellow eye controls.
RESULTS: Optical coherence tomography inflammation score and total CD45+ cell number were significantly higher in AAV injected eyes compared to uninjected fellow eye and sham injected controls. Clinically apparent inflammation (vitritis on optical coherence tomography) and cellular inflammation (CD45+ cell number) was significantly increased in AAV injected eyes and peaked around day 7. Vitritis resolved by day 29, but cellular inflammation persisted through day 29. On day 1, neutrophils and activated monocytes were the dominant cell populations in all AAV injected eyes. On day 7, eyes of AAV exposed animals had significantly more dendritic cells and T cells than eyes of AAV naive animals. By day 29, CD8- T cells were the dominant CD45+ cell population in AAV injected eyes.
CONCLUSIONS: Intravitreal AAV injection in mice generates clinically evident inflammation that is mild and seems to resolve spontaneously. However, the total number of intraocular CD45+ cells, particularly T cells, remain elevated. Both innate and adaptive immune cells respond to intravitreal AAV regardless of prior immune status, but the adaptive response is delayed in AAV naive eyes.",12,2021-Feb-01

Uveitis is a sight threatening intraocular inflammation accounting for approximately 10% of blindness worldwide. On the basis of aetiology, disease can be classified as infectious or non-infectious; and by anatomical localization of inflammation as anterior, posterior and panuveitis. Non-infectious uveitis is believed to be autoimmune in nature with Th1 and Th17 cells being identified as the prominent effector cell types. Numerous animal models of autoimmune uveitis were developed contributing to our understanding of this inflammatory condition. The classical peptide-induced experimental autoimmune uveoretinitis (EAU) model resembles human posterior uveitis due to the recurrent/relapsing nature of the disease; while the intraocular inflammation triggered by administration of bacterial lipopolisaccharide (endotoxin-induced uveitis, EIU) mimics closely anterior uveitis. The clinical need for novel, more targeted forms of anti-inflammatory therapy has emerged as currently available therapeutic strategies are associated with a number of adverse effects and intolerance in patients. This review summarises knowledge about existing mouse models of uveitis, discusses mechanisms driving intraocular inflammation and describes possible customised translational treatment strategies that can be potentially used in the clinic to prevent blindness in patients.",12,2015-1-1

Experimental autoimmune uveoretinitis (EAU) is a mouse model of human autoimmune uveitis marked by ocular autoantigen-specific regulatory immunity in the spleen. The melanocortin 5 receptor (MC5r) and adenosine 2 A receptor (A2Ar) are required for induction of post-EAU regulatory T cells (Tregs) which provide resistance to EAU.

To assess uveitis (including iritis and iridocyclitis) incidence from clinical trials of etanercept in patients with ankylosing spondylitis (AS).
METHODS: Clinical trials of etanercept in AS (four placebo-controlled; one active-controlled; three open-label) were examined for reports of uveitis. Between-group differences with confidence intervals (CIs) in the uveitis rates were calculated for the double-blind, active-controlled and long-term studies.
RESULTS: In placebo-controlled trials, the uveitis rate per 100 subject years (95% CI) for etanercept (8.6 (4.5 to 14.2)) was lower than that for placebo (19.3 (11.0 to 29.8), p = 0.03). In the active comparator trial, rates for etanercept and sulfasalazine were similar (10.7 (5.5 to 17.6) and 14.7 (6.4 to 26.5), respectively; p = 0.49). The long-term rate for etanercept, estimated from both placebo-controlled and open-label extension studies was 12.0 (10.0 to 14.1).

Ocular inflammation is one of the leading causes of blindness and loss of vision. Human uveitis is a complex and heterogeneous group of diseases characterized by inflammation of intraocular tissues. The eye may be the only organ involved, or uveitis may be part of a systemic disease. A significant number of cases are of unknown etiology and are labeled idiopathic. Animal models have been developed to the study of the physiopathogenesis of autoimmune uveitis due to the difficulty in obtaining human eye inflamed tissues for experiments. Most of those models are induced by injection of specific photoreceptors proteins (e.g., S-antigen, interphotoreceptor retinoid-binding protein, rhodopsin, recoverin, phosducin). Non-retinal antigens, including melanin-associated proteins and myelin basic protein, are also good inducers of uveitis in animals. Understanding the basic mechanisms and pathogenesis of autoimmune ocular diseases are essential for the development of new treatment approaches and therapeutic agents. The present review describes the main experimental models of autoimmune ocular inflammatory diseases.",12,2012-1-1

Uveitis involves acute, recurrent or chronic inflammation of the uvea, and occurs when the normal state of ocular immune privilege has broken down. Accumulating evidence implicates the role of microbial triggers in the development of various forms of immune-mediated uveitis in addition to its causative role in infectious uveitis. Toll-like receptors (TLRs) are the most important pattern-recognition receptors of the innate immune system that recognize pathogen-associated molecular patterns of microbes. Activation of TLRs by pathogen-associated molecular patterns leads to the induction of an inflammatory cascade and activation of both innate and adaptive arms of the immune response. TLRs have been implicated in the pathogenesis of various inflammatory diseases, including uveitis. This review provides an update on recent progress in TLR research and uveitis, specifically summarizing new evidence for the role of TLRs in anterior uveitis. There have been important observations from studies involving human ocular tissue, clinical uveitis and from experimental animal models of uveitis, such as endotoxin-induced uveitis. The 'Toll rush' has certainly gained momentum, and future advances in this field have the potential for selectively targeting the TLR pathway and ultimately translating into better therapies for patients with sight-threatening uveitis.",12,2012-Nov-1

To investigate the uveitogenic potential of retinal S-antigen (S-Ag) in horses.
METHODS: Horses were immunized subcutaneously with S-Ag or BSA as control antigen, emulsified in complete Freund's adjuvant. Simultaneously, Bordetella pertussis was given intravenously. Antigen specific T- and B-cell responses were analyzed in a 3-day interval. Disease development was judged clinically and histopathologically. Two identical booster immunizations were given every 4 weeks to test induction of recurrences.
RESULTS: T- and B-cell responses specific for S-Ag were observed in all immunized horses but were absent in control animals. However, uveitis developed in only one of five animals. Reimmunization with S-Ag did not lead to a uveitic relapse in this horse. All other horses of the S-Ag- and BSA-treated groups neither showed any signs of uveitis, nor had inflammatory infiltrates of the inner eye.
CONCLUSIONS: In contrast to interphotoreceptor retinoid-binding protein (IRBP), S-Ag is a weak autoantigen in horses. Even though S-Ag immunization leads to the activation of autoreactive T- and B-cells, infiltration of the inner eye and induction of uveitis are controlled in most horses.",11,2004-Jul-1

This study was aimed at assessing the long-term ocular control of adalimumab (ADA) in a large real-world population with noninfectious primary or secondary uveitis, focusing on the steroid-sparing effect and on disease-modifying antirheumatic drug (DMARD) cotreatment.
METHODS: In this retrospective, multicenter study, the efficacy of ADA was evaluated in terms of ocular control, changes in best-corrected visual acuity (BCVA), corticosteroid-sparing effect, and drug retention rate, overall and stratified according to DMARD cotreatment.
RESULTS: 106 patients were included. 88.7% had an associated systemic disease. After 6 and 12 months, proportions of patients with effective ocular control were 83.7% and 83.3%, respectively. At last the follow-up, 94.6% of patients had satisfactory ocular control. No difference in terms of ocular control at all time points emerged among patients starting ADA for ocular 
CONCLUSION: The long-term ocular control of ADA in noninfectious primary or secondary uveitis is confirmed, also for BCVA preservation. Concomitant use of DMARDs does not provide additional benefits to ADA alone in terms of ocular control, steroid spare, and drug retention rate.",11,2019-1-1

To evaluate the long-term uveal and capsular biocompatibility of 5 intraocular lenses (IOLs) in eyes with uveitic cataract.
SETTING: Department of Ophthalmology, Medical University of Vienna, Vienna, Austria.
DESIGN: Comparative case series.
METHODS: Patients with uveitis of various origin were consecutively recruited for cataract surgery (1998-2006) and received 1 of 3 hydrophilic acrylic IOLs (Hydroview, AcrySof MA60BM, or Injectacryl F3000), a silicone IOL (CeeOn 911), or a hydrophilic acrylic IOL with heparin surface modification (BioVue(3)). A 7-year follow-up was performed in the Hydroview, AcrySof, and CeeOn groups. Visual acuity, anterior chamber flare measurements, specular microscopy, biomicroscopy, and fundoscopy were performed postoperatively at 6 months and 1, 2, and 3 years.
RESULTS: The study enrolled 136 eyes of 115 patients. There were no significant differences in anterior chamber flare results between the 5 groups. The Hydroview group had the highest grade and the CeeOn IOL and AcrySof groups had the lowest grade of posterior capsule opacification. The BioVue(3) and Injectacryl IOLs had good uveal biocompatibility. Patients in all groups had better visual acuity postoperatively.
CONCLUSIONS: Overall, patients with uveitis benefited from cataract surgery. The long-term results indicate that all sharp-edged hydrophilic and hydrophobic IOLs performed well in eyes with uveitis. Higher uveal biocompatibility was achieved with the modern hydrophilic acrylic IOLs than with the hydrophobic acrylic IOL. Modern hydrophilic acrylic IOLs seem to be a good option in these cases.

Bartonella henselae has been implicated as a causative agent of chronic uveitis in people and in some cats. The objective of this study was to determine whether Bartonella species seroprevalence or titer magnitude varies among cats with uveitis, cats without ocular diseases recorded and healthy cats, while controlling for age and risk of flea exposure based on state of residence. There was no difference in seroprevalence rates or titer magnitude between cats with uveitis and cats with non-ocular diseases. Healthy cats were more likely to be seropositive for Bartonella species than cats with uveitis. The median Bartonella species titer was 1:64 for all groups, although healthy cats were more likely to have higher titers than cats with uveitis and cats with non-ocular disease. The results suggest that serum antibody tests alone cannot be used to document clinical uveitis associated with Bartonella species infection.",11,2008-Feb-1

To report long-term outcomes of cataract surgery with primary posterior chamber intraocular lens (IOL) implantation in children with chronic uveitis.
SETTING: Department of Ophthalmology, Pitié-Salpêtrière Hospital, Paris, France.
DESIGN: Case series.
METHODS: This case series comprised patients younger than 16 years with chronic uveitis who underwent phacoemulsification with primary implantation of a heparin surface-modified poly(methyl methacrylate) posterior chamber IOL in the capsular bag. The intraocular inflammation was fully controlled for at least 3 consecutive months before surgery in all cases. The main outcome measures were final corrected distance visual acuity (CDVA), postoperative inflammation, complications, and level of immunosuppressive treatment.
RESULTS: Twenty-two eyes of 16 children (7 girls, 9 boys; median age at surgery 9.5 years old) were included. Underlying uveitic entities were juvenile idiopathic arthritis in 9 patients; idiopathic uveitis in 4; and Behçet disease, sarcoidosis, and varicella zoster-associated uveitis in 1 patient each. The final CDVA was 0.3 logMAR or better in all cases. Postoperative complications included posterior capsule opacification requiring laser capsulotomy in 2 eyes, glaucoma in 4 eyes, and cystoid macular edema/macular dysfunction in 3 eyes. The mean dose of oral prednisone was 29.5 mg/day preoperatively and 8.13 mg/day at the last follow-up. The median follow-up was 6 years (range 5 to 19 years).
CONCLUSION: The results indicate that uveitis is not a formal contraindication to primary IOL implantation in the management of pediatric cataract surgery in cases with full control of intraocular inflammation.

Uveitis is one of the most frequent ophthalmologic manifestations in rheumatology. Uveal inflammation can underlie a systemic inflammatory rheumatic disease (SIRD) in approximately 30% of cases with a significant burden on the quality of life since it represents a cause of blindness in up to 20% of cases in Western countries.
METHODS: In this review, we provide a comprehensive overview of the pathophysiology of uveitis associated with SIRDs. According to our literature survey on the epidemiology of uveitis among SIRDs, spondyloarthritides, Behçet's disease and sarcoidosis get the major impact.
RESULTS: In Behçet's uveitis, the key players are highly polarized Th1 and Th17 lymphocytes, natural killer T cells and γδ T cells. All contribute to a great destructive inflammatory environment with the most serious visual damage resulting from the involvement of the posterior segment of the eye. In contrast, spondyloarthritides-related uveitis derives from a complex interaction between genetic background and extra-ocular inflammatory mediators originating from enthesitis, arthritis, psoriatic lesions and microbiome pro-inflammatory alterations. In such conditions, the immune infiltration of CD4+ T cells, Th17 and natural killer cells along with pro-inflammatory cytokines, TNF-α among all, leads to intraocular inflammation. Lastly, granuloma formation represents the primary hallmark lesion in sarcoid uveitis. This suggests a profound link between the innate system that mainly recruits activated macrophages and adaptive system involving by Th1, Th17 and Th17.1 cells.
CONCLUSIONS: Awareness among rheumatologists of a potential severe ocular involvement generates new insights into targeted therapeutic approaches and personalized treatments for each patient.",11,2021-Aug-1

To review new clinically relevant data regarding the intraocular treatment of noninfectious uveitis.
RECENT FINDINGS: Triamcinolone acetonide, the most commonly used intravitreal corticosteroid for treatment of uveitis and uveitic macular oedema has a limited duration of action and is associated with a high risk of corticosteroid-induced intraocular pressure (IOP) rise and cataract. Recent advances have led to the development of sustained-release corticosteroid devices using different corticosteroids such as dexamethasone and fluocinolone acetonide. Treatment options for patients who have previously exhibited corticosteroid hypertensive response have also expanded through the use of new noncorticosteroid intravitreal therapeutics such as methotrexate and antivascular endothelial growth factor (anti-VEGF) agents.
SUMMARY: Ozurdex dexamethasone implant appears to have a better safety profile, and a slightly long-lasting effect than triamcinolone acetonide. The Retisert implant allows the release of corticosteroids at a constant rate for 2.5 years, but it requires surgical placement and its use is associated with a very high risk of cataract and requirement for IOP-lowering surgery. For patients who are steroid responders, methotrexate may offer a better alternative to corticosteroid treatment than anti-VEGF agents, but controlled trials are required to confirm this.",11,2011-Nov-1

Vogt-Koyanagi-Harada disease (VKHD) is a multisystemic disorder characterized by granulomatous panuveitis variably combined with T cell-mediated neurologic and cutaneous manifestations. Early and aggressive treatment with systemic corticosteroids is the mainstay of treatment for VKHD. Additional use of immunosuppressants, intravenous immunoglobulins, and tumor necrosis factor-alpha inhibitors can help the most severely affected patients and work as corticosteroid-sparing agents. We report the case of a young woman with relapsing and multiresistant VKHD who demonstrated a stable remission of both uveitis and high-frequency hearing loss following rituximab intravenous administration (1 g. twice, 2 weeks apart, and 6 months later). A complete clinical response was observed 1 month since the first infusion, and no ocular relapses were recorded during the following year; in addition, audiometry showed a high-frequency hearing recovery in the right ear. Further observational studies are required to define the role of CD20 inhibition in the management of VKHD.",11,2015-Oct-1

PurposeTo present the patient profiles, clinical presentations and visual outcomes in those diagnosed with ocular syphilis, attending a subspecialist uveitis service in northern England over a 15-year period.Patients and methodsRetrospective observational case series of patients presenting between January 2002 and December 2016.ResultsA total of 50 eyes of 34 patients had intraocular inflammation due to syphilis. Of these, 94% were male, and 75% were men who had sex with men. Ten (29%), all male, were HIV-positive. Presentations included isolated anterior non-granulomatous uveitis, intermediate uveitis, panuveitis, retinitis, placoid chorioretinitis and papillitis. Concurrent skin rash and/or headache were seen in 41%. Compliance with antibiotic treatment was complete, but there was a high rate of default from ophthalmological follow-up (38%). Visual improvement was seen in 92% of eyes, and at final assessment 71% had acuity of 6/9 or better.ConclusionsOcular syphilis is continuing to increase in incidence, in tandem with the continuing epidemic of early syphilis in the UK (the risk of ocular involvement being about 1%). Almost all are male, and most are men who have sex with men. Clinical presentation is variable; a high index of suspicion and a low threshold for serological testing is important; early treatment can reverse retinal changes and restore visual acuity.",11,2018-Jan-1

The purpose of this study was to determine the effect on intraocular pressure (IOP) and visual acuity of treating uveitis-related hypotony in patients with vitrectomy and intravitreal silicone oil injection.
METHODS: Patients who underwent pars plana vitrectomy and silicone oil injection for uveitis-associated hypotony treatment were identified retrospectively. The primary outcome was maintaining an IOP of > or =5 mmHg. Visual acuity improvement was defined as an increase in > or =2 lines of acuity.
RESULTS: Twelve eyes of 10 patients were identified. Median preoperative IOP was 2 mmHg (range: 0-7 mmHg). Two of 12 eyes had an IOP of > or =5 mmHg at presentation. The number of eyes with an IOP of > or =5 mmHg was 7 of 12 eyes (58%) at 1 month, 4 of 12 eyes (33%) at 3 months, 6 of 12 eyes (50%) at 6 months, and 3 of 9 eyes (33%) at 1 year. Five of 12 eyes (42%) were reinjected between 1 and 3 times with silicone oil for recurring hypotony. Median presenting Snellen visual acuity was counting fingers (range: 20/125 to light perception). Seven of 9 eyes (78%) maintained their preoperative vision at 1 year.
CONCLUSION: Intraocular pressure elevated modestly in most patients in this series. However, results were often transient, and some eyes required repeated silicone oil injections. Although silicone oil is reasonable to consider for the treatment and maintenance of IOP in patients with ocular hypotony secondary to uveitis, better treatments are needed.",11,2010-Jan-1

Uveitis is a common cause of vision loss, accounting for 10-15 % of all cases of blindness worldwide and affects individuals of all ages, genders, and races. Uveitis represents a broad range of intraocular inflammatory conditions due to complications of autoimmune diseases, bacterial infections, viral infections, and chemical and metabolic injuries. Endotoxin-induced uveitis (EIU) in rodents is an efficient experimental model to investigate the pathological mechanism and pharmacological efficacy of potential drug agents. EIU is characterized by clinically relevant classical signs of inflammation, including inflammatory exudates and cells in the anterior and vitreous chambers. EIU in small animal models such as rats, mice, and rabbits is a short-lived uveal inflammation that can be developed subsequent to administration of bacterial endotoxin, such as lipopolysaccharide. Here, we present a reproducible, reliable, and simplified protocol to induce EIU in mice. This method could be used with similar efficacy for EIU induction in other small animals as well.",11,2013-1-1

Intraocular inflammation in patients with human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection is commonly due to infectious uveitis. Ocular lesions due to opportunistic infections (OI) are the most common and have been described extensively in the pre highly active antiretroviral therapy (HAART) era. Many eye lesions were classified as acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS) defining illnesses. HAART-associated improvement in immunity of the individual has changed the pattern of incidence of these hitherto reported known lesions leading to a marked reduction in the occurrence of ocular OI. Newer ocular lesions and newer ocular manifestations of known agents have been noted. Immune recovery uveitis (IRU), the new menace, which occurs as part of immune recovery inflammatory syndrome (IRIS) in the eye, can present with significant ocular inflammation and can pose a diagnostic and therapeutic challenge. Balancing the treatment of inflammation with the risk of reactivation of OI is a task by itself. Ocular involvement in the HAART era can be due to the adverse effects of some systemic drugs used in the management of HIV/AIDS. Drug-associated retinal toxicity and other ocular side effects are being increasingly reported. In this review, we discuss the ocular manifestations in HIV patients and its varied presentations following the introduction of HAART, drug-associated lesions, and the current treatment guidelines.",11,2020-Sep-1

Uveitis is a major visual impairment disease affecting parts or the entire uveal tract and occasionally the sclera, the cornea or the optic nerve. The disease is a major cause of ocular morbidity and blindness in immunocompetent and immunocompromised patients. In this work we analyzed the sensitivity and specificity of real-time PCR to detect the etiological agent from blood, plasma, vitreous and aqueous humor and compared with the diagnostic hypothesis.
METHODS: Twenty-seven patients (13 male) were studied and Real-time PCR method was used for the detection of herpes simplex virus 1 (HSV-1), herpes simplex virus 2 (HSV-2), varicella zoster virus (VZV), cytomegalovirus (CMV), Mycobacterium tuberculosis (TB) and Toxoplasma gondii (Toxo) in the aqueous humor as well as in the vitreous, blood and plasma.
RESULTS: Our results showed the presence of Toxo, CMV, VZV or HSV-2 in 19.2% of aqueous humor samples, and in 30% of vitreous humor samples. In plasma and blood samples, only CMV was detected (11.1% and 3.7%, respectively).
CONCLUSION: Real-time PCR was able to detect and to confirm diagnostic hypothesis in uveitis. Our data also confirms that vitreous humor is the best source for molecular diagnosis of infectious uveitis but indicates aqueous humor samples that are easier to obtain may also be appropriate to be tested by Real-time PCR.",11,2011-1-1

To evaluate the prevalence and aetiology of intraocular hypertension (OHT) in granulomatous and non-granulomatous uveitis
METHODS: Medical records of 304 consecutive patients (484 eyes) with uveitis who visited the National Defense Medical Collage Hospital between April 2010 and March 2013 were reviewed retrospectively. OHT irrelevant to glaucomatous changes in optic disc or visual field was investigated.
RESULTS: OHT was found in 123 eyes (25.4%) of 93 uveitic patients (30.6%); 92% of the eyes had open-angle OHT, 45.6% of which was steroid-induced. The prevalence of OHT was 100% (8/8) in Posner-Schlossman syndrome, 50.0% (10/20) in varicella zoster virus-associated iridocyclitis, 45% (9/20) in scleritis, 34.1% (15/44) in Vogt-Koyanagi-Harada disease, 32.1% (18/56) in Behçet's disease (BD), 23.1% (6/26) in acute anterior uveitis, and 20.2% (19/94) in sarcoidosis. Pupillary block was observed only in non-granulomatous uveitis, but not in granulomatous uveitis. Seventy percent of OHT in granulomatous uveitis cases was inflammation-induced, while 76.7% in non-granulomatous uveitis cases was steroid-induced.
CONCLUSIONS: OHT in non-granulomatous uveitis was mainly steroid-induced open-angle OHT with some cases of angle-closure OHT caused by pupillary block, while that in granulomatous uveitis was mostly inflammation-induced open-angle OHT with no pupillary block-related angle-closure OHT.",11,2014-Jul-1

Several intraocular infections can present with protean manifestations posing major diagnostic and management challenges. Infections such as tuberculosis, dengue and chikungunya fever have continued to remain major endemic diseases that are associated with uveitis in the Asia Pacific region. These entities often require a high index of clinical suspicion and laboratory analysis including assays of ocular fluids and/or tissues for confirmation of the diagnosis. Infectious uveitis caused by tuberculosis, dengue and chikungunya can present with characteristic clinical features and imaging findings on ancillary investigations; that may provide clue to the early diagnosis. Use of modern imaging modalities such as enhanced-depth imaging optical coherence tomography, optical coherence tomography angiography and ultra-wide field fundus photography greatly aid in the evaluation of these conditions. In the current review, we have discussed the epidemiology, clinical phenotypes, imaging characteristics, diagnosis and management of uveitis caused by tuberculosis, dengue and chikungunya.",11,2019-Jan-1

This study reports on serum interleukin 2-receptor (IL-2R) levels in uveitis patients. IL-2R is the mediator protein of interleukin 2 (IL-2), a mitogenetic cytokine of primarily immune cell interaction. Stimulated T-cells readily express IL-2R on their cell surface and release a soluble form into serum. The measurement of IL-2R serum levels was performed using a monoclonal antibody based ELISA with age and sex matched healthy blood donors serving as the control group. The increase of IL-2R serum levels in patients affected by heterochromic cyclitis Fuchs (HCF) and a small group of children with chronic anterior uveitis affected by juvenile rheumatoid arthritis (JRA) was statistically highly significant, when compared to the control group (n = 84, alpha = 0.01). Serum levels of patients with intermediate uveitis (IU), patients with HLA-B27 positive acute anterior uveitis (AAU) and patients with HLA-B27 negative AAU did not differ significantly from the controls.",11,1990-1-1

To identify predictors of treatment success in syphilitic uveitis (SU).
DESIGN: Retrospective multicentric analysis of patients treated for SU.
PARTICIPANTS: A total of 95 eyes (66 patients, mean [standard deviation] aged 49 [12.5] years, 31 [47%] of whom were human immunodeficiency virus [HIV]+) were analyzed.
METHODS: Activity of SU was assessed at 1 week and 1 month after treatment onset, and at last follow-up. Improvement was defined by a ≥2-step decrease of both anterior chamber and vitreous haze inflammation levels, and by the size reduction in chorioretinal lesions.
MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Recovery was defined as the resolution of inflammation in all anatomic structures at 1 month.
RESULTS: Panuveitis and posterior uveitis were the most frequent findings. Inflammatory parameters were higher in HIV+ patients. Recovery was reported in 65% and 85% of eyes at 1 month and at last follow-up, respectively. In multivariate analysis, after adjusting for initial best-corrected visual acuity and the antimicrobial treatment regimen, clinical improvement at 1 week (corrected risk ratios [cRR], 3.5 [2.3-3.8]; P = 0.001) was predictive of recovery at 1 month, whereas the use of periocular dexamethasone injections (cRR, 0.05 [0.02-0.6]; P = 0.01) and methylprednisolone pulses negatively affected the outcomes of eyes.
CONCLUSIONS: Early improvement is the strongest predictor of ophthalmological recovery in SU.",11,2017-Dec-1

A single injection of the retinal soluble antigen (S-Ag, 30 micrograms) to the Lewis or the heterozygous (rnu/+) rats induces a severe bilateral uveitis, characterized initially by infiltration of the retina with inflammatory cells. The athymic nude rat (homozygous rnu/rnu), which lacks the thymus gland and T cell-mediated functions, does not develop ocular inflammatory disease, clinically of histologically, after repeated challenges with S-Ag. Circulating anti-S-Ag antibodies were found in S-Ag-immunized Lewis rats and in the heterozygous, but not the athymic nude rats. Good proliferative responses to concanavalin A, S-Ag and purified protein derivitive of tuberculin (PPD) were found in lymphocyte cultures prepared from the draining lymph nodes of immunized heterozygous rats, but not when lymphocytes from the athymic nude rats were used. Uveitis could be induced in the athymic nude rat when lymphocytes from S-Ag-immunized heterozygous rats were transferred to them. By stimulating the donor lymphocytes in vitro with S-Ag before transfer, the number of recipients that developed uveitis was increased. On the other hand, it was impossible to transfer disease with hyperimmune serum alone. The possible role of T lymphocytes in the induction of experimental autoimmune uveitis with S-Ag is discussed.",11,1982-Jun-1

Seven eyes and one vitrectomy specimen from seven patients with pars planitis and complications such as secondary glaucoma and phthisis bulbi were studied histopathologically. Two of the specimens were also examined by electron microscopy. All cases showed a typical intravitreal ""snowbank"" opacity overlying the pars plana. On light microscopy, these ""snowbanks"" appeared to consist of a loose fibrovascular layer containing occasional fibrocyte-like cells and scattered mononuclear inflammatory cells adjacent to the hyperplastic nonpigmented epithelium of the pars plana. Within the vitreous base, an extensive fibroglial proliferation had developed, often drawing the peripheral retina anteriorly into the ""snowbank."" Electron microscopy showed this fibroglial tissue to be composed of condensed vitreous collagen and probable fibrous astrocytes which had produced larger-diameter (about 24 mm) collagen fibrils. The fibroglial proliferation also appeared continuous with an ultrastructurally similar preretinal fibroglial membrane. All eyes showed prominent lymphocytic cuffing and mural infiltration of retinal veins, with sparing of the arterioles. Several cases showed cystoid macular edema. Only mild choroiditis or cyclitis could be shown in some cases. We believe that in pars planitis the fibroglial ""snowbank"" may reflect a common inflammatory process involving both the peripheral retina and vitreous base.",11,1978-Dec-1

Our aim was to determine the recurrence rate of inflammation in Vogt-Koyanagi-Harada (VKH) disease and to describe its clinical features.
METHODS: We retrospectively evaluated patients diagnosed as having VKH disease with exudative retinal detachment at the Osaka University Hospital or the Japanese Community Healthcare Organization, Osaka Hospital, between 1998 and 2012. All patients received high-dose corticosteroid therapy as the initial treatment and were followed for at least 6 months. Demographic data, including age, sex, visual acuity (VA) levels at initial presentation and at 1 year after initial therapy, treatment received, and recurrent episodes were reviewed.
RESULTS: Fifty-five consecutive patients with VKH disease were identified (36 women; mean age 38.6 ± 10.4 years). Fourteen patients (25.5 %) had recurrent inflammation, which manifested as posterior uveitis in eight and as anterior uveitis in six of the patients. Recurrent posterior segment inflammation was more likely to develop in patients whose VA at initial presentation was poor (P = 0.039) and in whom orally administered corticosteroid was tapered rapidly (to 30 mg within 3 weeks or less, to 20 mg within 2 months or less, and to 10 mg within 3 months or less) (P = 0.006, P = 0.066, and P = 0.041, respectively).
CONCLUSIONS: About 25 % of patients with VKH disease had recurrent inflammation. Poor initial VA and rapid tapering of the corticosteroid were associated with posterior recurrence.",11,2015-May-1

PMID: 33845022
The purpose of this study was to determine classification criteria for multiple sclerosis-associated intermediate uveitis.
DESIGN: Machine learning of cases with multiple sclerosis-associated intermediate uveitis and 4 other intermediate uveitides.
METHODS: Cases of intermediate uveitides were collected in an informatics-designed preliminary database, and a final database was constructed of cases achieving supermajority agreement on the diagnosis, using formal consensus techniques. Cases were split into a training set and a validation set. Machine learning using multinomial logistic regression was used in the training set to determine a parsimonious set of criteria that minimized the misclassification rate among the intermediate uveitides. The resulting criteria were evaluated in the validation set.
RESULTS: A total of 589 cases of intermediate uveitides, including 112 cases of multiple sclerosis-associated intermediate uveitis, were evaluated by machine learning. The overall accuracy for intermediate uveitides was 99.8% in the training set and 99.3% in the validation set (95% confidence interval: 96.1-99.9). Key criteria for multiple sclerosis-associated intermediate uveitis included unilateral or bilateral intermediate uveitis and multiple sclerosis diagnosed by the McDonald criteria. Key exclusions included syphilis and sarcoidosis. The misclassification rates for multiple sclerosis-associated intermediate uveitis were 0 % in the training set and 0% in the validation set.
CONCLUSIONS: The criteria for multiple sclerosis-associated intermediate uveitis had a low misclassification rate and appeared to perform sufficiently well enough for use in clinical and translational research.",11,2021-Aug-1

To assess whether the previously demonstrated short-term efficacy of the immunosuppressant mycophenolate mofetil (MMF; CellCept, Roche) is maintained in the long-term management of refractory uveitis.
METHODS: The study was an open-label, non-comparative retrospective series of 14 patients with refractory uveitis and treated with MMF for a mean of >33 months. Mycophenolate mofetil was given at a dosage of 1 g (oral) twice daily. Indications included prednisolone reduction, additive agent with cyclosporin, or replacement therapy (azathioprine or methotrexate). The intraocular inflammatory response, side-effects, and toxicity were monitored.
RESULTS: Intraocular inflammation remained under control in 10 patients, unchanged in three and deteriorated in one patient. Transient side-effects included tiredness, headache and dizziness (one patient each, lasting less than 2 weeks from the time of MMF introduction). Mycophenolate mofetil was stopped in one patient because of absence of prolonged clinical improvement. Vision improved in 25% (7 eyes), did not change in 50% (14 eyes), but was reduced in 25% (7 eyes).
CONCLUSIONS: Mycophenolate mofetil is safe for long-term usage and is recommended for treatment of refractory panuveitis or posterior uveitis with uncontrolled inflammation despite high prednisolone maintenance dosage (>15 mg/day) or toxicity or lack of efficacy of other immuno-suppressive agents. However, MMF is less effective for refractory uveitis unresponsive to azathioprine.",11,2003-Dec-1

Glaucoma secondary to ocular inflammation is potentially blinding and requires aggressive multifaceted management. The pathogenesis is related to the intraocular pressure elevation secondary to compromised aqueous humor outflow by inflammatory cells, chemical mediators released into the aqueous, and to the uveitic therapy itself (corticosteroid induced). The management of uveitic glaucoma needs a careful combination between anti-inflammatory therapy and appropriate intraocular pressure-lowering drugs to prevent worsening of condition and long-term visual loss. Although there have been novel medications that have emerged in the management of glaucoma and uveitis, around 30% of uveitic glaucoma eyes do not respond to maximal medical therapy and require surgical intervention. Studied procedures include laser therapy, filtration surgery, and glaucoma drainage devices, as well as recent surgical techniques for intraocular pressure control such as minimally invasive glaucoma surgery and angle-based procedures. We review and update the medical and surgical management of uveitic glaucoma.",11,2020-1-1

To assess the utility of ultra-wide field (UWF) versus conventional fundus imaging in the management of tubercular (TB) posterior uveitis.
METHODS: Twenty-two consecutive patients (33 eyes) diagnosed with TB posterior uveitis in a tertiary care center who underwent UWF fundus photography and fluorescein angiography (FA) between July 2014 and March 2015 were included. Complete clinical and imaging records of the patients were retrospectively reviewed. A circle simulating the central 75-degree field was drawn on UWF pseudocolor and fluorescein angiography images. Findings within the circle were compared with the information yielded by the complete image and its impact on patient management was noted.
RESULTS: The clinical manifestations of posterior tubercular uveitis included retinal vasculitis (17 eyes), multifocal serpiginoid choroiditis (13 eyes), choroidal granulomas (2 eyes) and intermediate uveitis (1 eye). UWF imaging revealed additional capillary non-perfusion areas, neovascularization, active vasculitis, and peripheral choroiditis lesions in 30/33 eyes (90.9%), which influenced treatment decision in 15 eyes (45.5%).
CONCLUSIONS: UWF imaging is useful in the detection of peripheral pathologies in tubercular posterior uveitis that may influence management decisions, such as addition of immunosuppressive therapy or scatter laser photocoagulation.",11,2016-Dec-1

Human interstitial retinoid binding protein (HIRBP) is a 136,000 m.w. photoreceptor cell protein which transports retinoids between the retina and the retinal pigment epithelium of the eye. The amino acid sequence of HIRBP suggests that the molecule consists of four continuous homology domains which arose by several gene duplications some 600 to 800 million years ago. When injected into susceptible animal species, including primates, it induces an experimental autoimmune uveitis (EAU), a predominantly T cell-mediated autoimmune disease of the retina and uveal tract of the eye, and the pineal gland. In order to further refine specific sites in HIRBP responsible for its uveitopathogenicity, we synthesized 120 overlapping peptide corresponding to its entire 1262 amino acid sequence, and tested each peptide for its ability to induce an EAU in Lewis rats. Five peptides with extensive amino acid sequence homology, designated HIRBP 715, HIRBP greater than 730 and HIRBP 745, HIRBP 778, and HIRBP 808 were uveitopathogenic when used at a 50 micrograms immunizing dose. The most potent peptide for the induction of EAU was HIRBP 715 (amino acid positions 521 to 540). In dose response studies as little as 0.1 microgram/animal was capable of inducing an inflammatory response. In addition, peptide HIRBP 946 which corresponds to the mid portion of peptide HIRBP 715 and contains only eight amino acids (RTATAAEE) was uveitopathogenic under our experimental conditions. Our study identifies multiple uveitopathogenic sites in HIRBP and further defines the amino acids necessary for the induction of EAU in one of these sites.",11,1989-Jul-01

Enthesitis-related arthritis (ERA) represents a subgroup of juvenile idiopathic arthritis (JIA) that is regularly accompanied by anterior uveitis. This study describes the prevalence and characteristics of ERA-related uveitis.
METHODS: Cross-sectional data from the National Pediatric Rheumatological Database (NPRD) were used to characterize ERA-related uveitis (ERA-U). In addition to sociodemographic variables, we documented the occurrence of uveitis and course of disease, including symptoms, visual acuity, and complications, as well as JIA characteristics such as disease activity (Juvenile Arthritis Disease Activity Score 10), functional ability (Childhood Health Assessment Questionnaire score), laboratory variables, and treatment.
RESULTS: In the years from 2002 to 2014, there were 3778 (15.2%) of a total of 24,841 JIA patients recorded in the NPRD who had ERA, and 280 (7.4%) of them had developed uveitis. Detailed ophthalmological documentation by a uveitis add-on module was available for 22.9% of these patients. Uveitis onset was acutely symptomatic in 63% of patients. Patients with uveitis were more frequently male, HLA-B27-positive, younger at ERA onset, and they had higher erythrocyte sedimentation rate values at first uveitis documentation than those without uveitis. Uveitis was diagnosed at a mean age of 11.5 (± 3.9) years (50% within 2 years after ERA onset). Systemic treatment with corticosteroids and synthetic and biologic disease-modifying antirheumatic drugs was associated with a (not significantly) lower risk of developing uveitis.
CONCLUSION: The course of disease in ERA-U patients is frequently similar to HLA-B27-associated uveitis in adults; however, a subgroup of patients presents with asymptomatic uveitis.",11,2021-Feb-1

In each case of extraintestinal manifestations of Crohn's disease, active disease, if present, should be treated to induce remission, which may positively influence the course of most concomitant extraintestinal manifestations. For some extraintestinal manifestations, however, a specific treatment should be introduced. This latter part of disease management will be discussed in this chapter, in particular for pyoderma gangrenosum, uveitis, spondylarthropathy - axial arthropathy - and primary sclerosing cholangitis, which have also been described in quiescent Crohn's disease. Few new drugs for the treatment of extraintestinal manifestations of Crohn's disease have been developed in the past and only the role of infliximab has increased in Crohn's disease-related extraintestinal manifestations. Drugs specifically aimed at this treatment, stemming from a few randomized controlled studies or case series, are sulfasalazine, 5-ASA, corticosteroids, azathioprine or 6-mercaptopurine, methotrexate, infliximab, adalimumab, etanercept and cyclosporine or tacrolimus. Unfortunately, because of the paucity of data in this field, the best evidence presented and discussed in this article for the treatment of these extraintestinal manifestations is extrapolated from patients that for the most part did not suffer from Crohn's disease.",11,2007-1-1

Autoimmune uveitis is a sight-threatening intraocular inflammation mainly caused by immune dysregulation. The development of safe and effective therapeutic approaches is urgently needed. Small extracellular vesicles (sEVs) derived from mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) have been demonstrated to inhibit autoimmune responses; however, the immunosuppressive effect of MSC-sEVs is too weak for clinical transfer. In the current study, we investigated the therapeutic effect of IL-10-overexpressing MSC-sEVs (sEV-IL10) on experimental autoimmune uveitis (EAU) and studied the underlying mechanism.
METHODS: Mice were randomly grouped and received a single tail vein injection of different sEVs (50 μg) or PBS on day 11 post-immunization. The clinical and histological scores were graded, and the percentage of T helper cell was measured. To investigate the effect of sEVs on the proliferation of T-cells and the differentiation of Th1, Th17 and Treg cells, T-cells were cocultured with sEVs under the corresponding culture conditions. After labeled with PKH-26, sEVs were traced both in vivo and in vitro.
RESULTS: Compared with normal or vector sEV-treated groups, mice in the sEV-IL10-treated group had lower clinical and histological scores with lower percentages of Th1 and Th17 cells in the eyes and higher percentages of Treg cells in the spleen and draining lymph nodes (LN). Furthermore, sEV-IL10 enhanced the suppressive effect of MSC-sEVs on the proliferation of T-cells and differentiation of Th1 and Th17 cells, whereas upregulated the differentiation of Treg cells. Both in vivo and in vitro experiments demonstrated that MSC-sEVs were rapidly enriched in target tissues and internalized by T-cells.
CONCLUSION: These results suggested that sEV-IL10 effectively ameliorates EAU by regulating the proliferation and differentiation of T-cells, indicating sEVs as a potential novel therapy for autoimmune uveitis or other autoimmune diseases.",11,2022-Mar-07

Immunization with bovine interphotoreceptor retinoid-binding protein induces autoimmune uveitis in B10.A mice. We have examined whether this soluble retina-specific Ag can induce anterior chamber-associated immune deviation when injected into the anterior chamber (AC) of the eye, and whether this deviant immune response has any effect on uveitis is susceptible mice. The results of these experiments indicate that interphotoreceptor retinoid-binding protein (IRBP) injected intracamerally altered the subsequent immune response of B10.A mice such that a) they were not able to develop IRBP-specific delayed hypersensitivity, nor (b) were they able to express significant autoimmune uveitis following a uveitogenic regimen. Moreover, spleen cells from mice that received IRBP in the AC suppressed uveitis when adoptively transferred into naive recipients. The splenic suppressor cells were able to prevent autoimmune uveitis in recipient mice when administered after the uveitogenic regimen. Most important, IRBP-specific splenic cells from mice treated with IRBP in the AC when injected into mice with established uveitis caused an abrupt cessation of the intraocular inflammation. The ability of intracamerally-injected soluble Ag to induce suppressor T cells that act on the efferent limb of the immune response suggests that the anterior-chamber-associated immune deviation phenomenon may have physiologic relevance in terms of preservation of the integrity of ocular tissue and renders this approach particularly suitable for treating already established experimental autoimmune diseases of this type. These results are discussed in terms of other methods that have been devised experimentally to suppress and prevent autoimmune uveitis and encephalomyelitis.",11,1992-Mar-15

RESULTS: All prednisone-treated patients had normal plasma creatinine (PCr) after 1 month of treatment (median 59.1 [45-85] μmol/l) whereas only 50 % of patients in the non-treatment group had normal creatinine (median 81.0 [42-123] μmol/l) at the same time point (p = 0.025). During 6 months' follow-up, PCr decreased in all patient groups; however, it decreased significantly only in prednisone-treated patients with baseline PCr >150 μmol/l (p < 0.001). At the end of follow-up, no difference in PCr, glomerular filtration rate (GFR), or low molecular weight (LMW) proteinuria could be found between the study groups. A considerable number of patients in both groups had subnormal GFR and/or persistent LMW proteinuria at the 6-month follow-up visit. Eighty-two percent of the patients had uveitis.
CONCLUSIONS: Prednisone speeds up the recovery from renal symptoms of TIN, especially in patients with severe nephritis. The renal function did not differ significantly between prednisone and control patients after 6 months' follow-up.",11,2013-Aug-1

Five immunosuppressive and anti-inflammatory agents were tested for their effects on development of experimental autoimmune uveoretinitis (EAU) and immune responses to S-antigen in rats immunized with this retinal antigen. When administered daily from day 0-14 after immunization, cyclosporine at 5-20 mg/Kg was nontoxic and yet effective in inhibiting the development of EAU for at least 30 days. All other tested drugs were found toxic at their immunosuppressive doses. Of these drugs, only cyclophosphamide (at 5-20 mg/Kg) was capable of inhibiting EAU in some of the treated rats for up to 30 days. Other agents, bredinin (40-100 mg/Kg), dexamethasone (0.2-0.4 mg/Kg), or colchicine (0.5 mg/Kg) produced only a delay in the disease onset. Cyclosporine was also unique in its effect on the immune responses of the rats by selectively inhibiting only the specific T-cell-mediated responses to S-antigen (delayed skin response and lymphocyte response in culture), while having no negative effect on antibody production or the lymphocyte response to the polyclonal mitogen, concanavalin A. Other drugs, when effective, inhibited all types of immune response. In addition, cyclosporine was capable of preventing EAU even when given to rats as late as from day 7 after immunization. Only cyclophosphamide (at 20 mg/Kg/day) had a similar effect on 1/3 of the rats, while other drugs only delayed or had no effect on the disease onset when given by this late schedule.",11,1985-Feb-1

Heat shock proteins with molecular weight 70 kDa (hsp70) are highly conserved immunogenic intracellular molecules. There are two main subtypes: one is expressed constitutively (hsc70), while the other is induced under stressful conditions (ihsp70). Using an ELISA directed against recombinant human ihsp70, antibody titers were determined in patients with defined ocular inflammatory conditions (Behçet's disease, Vogt-Koyanagi-Harada (VKH), pars planitis, and sarcoidosis) as well as in a group of age-matched normal volunteers. In comparison to healthy controls (n = 14, absorbance 0.269), levels were significantly elevated in Behçet's disease (n = 18; 0.412), sarcoidosis (n = 15; 0.432), and pars planitis (n = 13; 0.346), but not in VKH (n = 10; 0.263). A correlation was also noted for treatment versus no treatment in pars planitis (p = 0.028), but not in other inflammatory conditions. There was no correlation with the level of intraocular disease activity as defined by vitreous haze and vision drop. Since pars planitis is a purely ocular condition, circulating levels of ihsp antibodies likely reflect the extent of disease involvement within the eye.",11,2001-Jun-1

To estimate the prevalence of uveitis in rural Tamil Nadu, India.
METHODS: Cluster sampling identified a population-based sample of 5150 persons ages 40 years and older, representative of three districts in Tamil Nadu, India. Each received a comprehensive dilated ocular examination by an ophthalmologist, and results were registered on forms requiring responses about the presence of ocular inflammatory signs and inflammatory diagnoses. Potential uveitis cases were confirmed by consensus of two uveitis specialists, upon review of study and medical records. Crude prevalence rates and prevalence rates age-adjusted to reflect the 2001 Tamil Nadu census population were calculated.
RESULTS: Crude and age-adjusted prevalence rates for endogenous uveitis were 310/100,000 and 317/100,000. The corresponding rates for all ocular inflammation were 450 and 467/100,000. Males tended to have a greater prevalence than females in this population, and older persons tended to have higher prevalence than younger persons. The majority of cases of posterior uveitis and infectious endophthalmitis were visually compromised, but few among the cases of other forms of ocular inflammation were visually impaired.
CONCLUSIONS: The results suggest that nearly one in 200 persons in rural, South India has been affected by ocular inflammation in at least one eye by mid to late adulthood, about one in 330 if cases related to surgery or trauma are not included. Postsurgical endophthalmitis and posterior uveitis were associated with a high rate of vision loss. These results indicate that uveitis is an important cause of ocular morbidity and of vision loss in this population.",11,2011-Apr-1

To assess the levels of retinal and choroidal involvement in initial-onset birdshot retinochoroiditis (BRC) and Vogt-Koyanagi-Harada (VKH) disease, two stromal choroiditis entities.
METHODS: This retrospective study included patients diagnosed with BRC and VKH, seen during initial-onset disease at the Centre for Ophthalmic Specialized Care, Lausanne, Switzerland. Angiographic signs were quantified, using an established dual fluorescein angiography (FA) and indocyanine green angiography (ICGA) scoring system for uveitis, and the FA/ICGA score ratios were compared between diseases.
RESULTS: Among 1793 patients with uveitis seen from 1995 to 2015, 7 newly diagnosed BRC patients and 4 patients with newly diagnosed VKH disease had sufficient data for study inclusion. Patients with BRC and VKH at initial onset had mean FA angiographic scores of 16.91 ± 3.42 and 4.06 ± 1.87; mean ICGA angiographic scores of 21.34 ± 3.49 and 25.75 ± 3.88; and mean FA/ICGA ratios of 0.79 ± 0.21 and 0.16 ± 0.09, respectively.
CONCLUSION: This study showed the differential involvements of the retina and choroid in BRC and VKH. The choroid was preponderantly involved in both diseases; thus, ICGA is essential for disease assessment and follow-up. However, these diseases also differed substantially. The origin of inflammation was primarily in the choroid in VKH and in both the choroid and retina in BRC. We recommend dual FA and ICGA for evaluating posterior uveitis, when choroiditis is suspected.",11,2018-Apr-1

Leukocyte trafficking from blood into tissue is a fundamental process in immune surveillance and the immune response to stimuli. Experimental autoimmune uveitis (EAU) is an animal model for posterior uveitis and is mediated by T lymphocytes and macrophages that infiltrate the posterior segment of the eye. To analyze leukocyte migration into retinal tissue during the course of EAU, labeled cells were identified in vivo by scanning laser ophthalmoscopy and in retinal flatmounts by confocal microscopy. Adhesion of blood leukocytes to retinal endothelial cells in vivo was significantly raised 48 h before the appearance of clinical disease, and this correlated with the increased expression of CD54 on retinal vessels. Mitogen-activated spleen cells and CD4+ T cells only entered into retinal tissue in animals with clinical disease and not naive recipients. The disease status of the donor animal had no effect on leukocyte trafficking. These results, which identify leukocyte-endothelial cell interactions in vivo, suggest that the activation of the retinal endothelium is a prerequisite to leukocyte adhesion and extravasation into ocular tissue during EAU.",11,1998-Oct-1

Although traditionally the adaptive immune system has been viewed as the essential contributor to autoimmune diseases, the evidence implicating the innate immune system has grown considerably in recent years. Several multisystem inflammatory diseases affect the uvea and occur as a result of a mutation in a gene coding for a component of the innate immune system. Diseases associated with uveitis such as ankylosing spondylitis, sarcoidosis, Behcet's disease and inflammatory bowel disease can best be conceptually understood by hypotheses that consider microbial infection and innate immunity as contributing factors.",11,2013-Feb-1

To investigate the effect of aldose reductase (AR) deficiency in protecting the chronic experimental autoimmune (EAU) and acute endotoxin-induced uveitis (EIU) in c57BL/6 mice.
METHODS: The WT and AR-null (ARKO) mice were immunized with human interphotoreceptor retinoid-binding peptide (hIRPB-1-20), to induce EAU, or were injected subcutaneously with lipopolysaccharide (LPS; 100 μg) to induce EIU. The mice were killed on day 21 for EAU and at 24 hours for EIU, when the disease was at its peak, and the eyes were immediately enucleated for histologic and biochemical studies. Spleen-derived T-lymphocytes were used to study the antigen-specific immune response in vitro and in vivo.
RESULTS: In WT-EAU mice, severe damage to the retinal wall, especially to the photoreceptor layer was observed, corresponding to a pathologic score of ∼2, which was significantly prevented in the ARKO or AR inhibitor-treated mice. The levels of cytokines and chemokines increased markedly in the whole-eye homogenates of WT-EAU mice, but not in ARKO-EAU mice. Further, expression of inflammatory marker proteins such as inducible nitric oxide synthase (iNOS), cyclooxygenase (COX)-2, tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-α, and vascular cell adhesion molecule (VCAM)-1 was increased in the WT-EIU mouse eyes but not in the ARKO-EIU eyes. The T cells proliferated vigorously when exposed to the hIRPB antigen in vitro and secreted various cytokines and chemokines, which were significantly inhibited in the T cells isolated from the ARKO mice.
CONCLUSIONS: These findings suggest that AR-deficiency/inhibition protects against acute as well as chronic forms of ocular inflammatory complications such as uveitis.",11,2011-Oct-17

To evaluate the reliability of clinical grading of vitreous haze using a new 9-step ordinal scale versus the existing 6-step ordinal scale.
DESIGN: Evaluation of diagnostic test (interobserver agreement study).
PARTICIPANTS: A total of 119 consecutive patients (204 uveitic eyes) presenting for uveitis subspecialty care on the study day at 1 of 3 large uveitis centers.
METHODS: Five pairs of uveitis specialists clinically graded vitreous haze in the same eyes, one after the other using the same equipment, using the 6- and 9-step scales.
MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Agreement in vitreous haze grade between each pair of specialists was evaluated by the κ statistic (exact agreement and agreement within 1 or 2 grades).
RESULTS: The scales correlated well (Spearman's ρ = 0.84). Exact agreement was modest using both the 6-step and 9-step scales: average κ = 0.46 (range, 0.28-0.81) and κ = 0.40 (range, 0.15-0.63), respectively. Within 1-grade agreement was slightly more favorable for the scale with fewer steps, but values were excellent for both scales: κ = 0.75 (range, 0.66-0.96) and κ = 0.62 (range, 0.38-0.87), respectively. Within 2-grade agreement for the 9-step scale also was excellent (κ = 0.85; range, 0.79-0.92). Two-fold more cases were potentially clinical trial eligible on the basis of the 9-step than the 6-step scale (P<0.001).
CONCLUSIONS: Both scales are sufficiently reproducible using clinical grading for clinical and research use with the appropriate threshold (≥ 2- and ≥ 3-step differences for the 6- and 9-step scales, respectively). The results suggest that more eyes are likely to meet eligibility criteria for trials using the 9-step scale. The 9-step scale appears to have higher reproducibility with Reading Center grading than clinical grading, suggesting that Reading Center grading may be preferable for clinical trials.",11,2014-Aug-1

The identification of an infectious or noninfectious uveitis syndrome is important to determine the range of therapeutic and prognostic implications of that disease entity. Diagnostic dilemmas arise with atypical history, atypical clinical presentations, inconclusive diagnostic workup, and persistent or worsened inflammation despite appropriate immunosuppression. More invasive intraocular testing is indicated in these situations particularly in infectious uveitis where a delay in treatment may result in worsening of the patient’s disease and a poor visual outcome. Laboratory analysis of vitreous fluid via diagnostic pars plana vitrectomy is an important technique in the diagnostic armamentarium, but the most important aspects of sample collection include rapid processing, close coordination with an ophthalmic pathology laboratory, and directed testing on this limited collected sample. Culture and staining has utility in bacterial, fungal, and nocardial infection. Polymerase chain reaction (PCR) analysis has shown promising results for bacterial endophthalmitis and infection with mycobacterium tuberculosis whereas PCR testing for viral retinitides and ocular toxoplasmosis has a more established role. Antibody testing is appropriate for toxoplasmosis and toxocariasis, and may be complementary to PCR for viral retinitis. Masquerade syndromes represent neoplastic conditions that clinically appear as infectious or inflammatory conditions and should be considered as part of the differential diagnosis. Diagnostic vitrectomy and chorioretinal biopsy are thus critical tools for the management of patients in whom an infectious etiology of uveitis is suspected.",11,2014-1-1

This study was undertaken in Otago, New Zealand, to provide data on the long-term results of cases of uveitis with secondary glaucoma drained by Molteno implants.
DESIGN: A prospective, noncomparative case series of all cases of chronic uveitis with secondary glaucoma drained by Molteno implants from 1978 through 1998.
PARTICIPANTS: Forty eyes of 35 patients.
INTERVENTION: Insertion of Molteno implant.
MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Intraocular pressure, visual acuity, and progressive visual field loss.
RESULTS: Insertion of a Molteno implant was effective in controlling the intraocular pressure at 21 mmHg or less with a probability of 0.87 (95% confidence interval [CI], 0.76, 0.98) and 0.77 (95% CI, 0.60, 0.93) at 5 and 10 or more years after surgery. The mean visual acuity improved from 20/100 to 20/70 immediately after operation. This value declined to 20/130 at 5 and 10 years after surgery and then improved slightly to 20/120 at 15 years after surgery. In these eyes, the Kaplan-Meier estimated probability of retaining useful vision (visual acuity >20/400; visual field >5 degrees radius) was 0.75 (95% CI, 0.61, 0.89) and 0.71 (95% CI, 0.55, 0.87) at 5 and 7 or more years after surgery.
CONCLUSIONS: The insertion of a Molteno implant controlled the intraocular pressure in 76% of cases over the follow-up period. Patients in whom the uveitis was well controlled maintained their visual acuity and visual fields, whereas the proportion of cases requiring steroids and the doses required fell progressively over the period of follow-up. Failures were related to complications of advanced disease, previous intraocular surgery, and failure to control the uveitis. The drainage system provided by the Molteno implant proved robust, continuing to function well despite continuous activity of the uveitis, acute exacerbations of the uveitis, and all subsequent intraocular surgery including cataract extraction, keratoplasty, and vitrectomy.",11,2001-Mar-1

To characterise uveitis in association with multiple sclerosis (MS).
METHODS: We conducted a retrospective chart review of patients with uveitis and MS at two uveitis centres (Portland, Oregon, USA and Heidelberg, Germany). Baseline characteristics and ophthalmic data were collected at the patient's first and last visits. Additionally, neurological records were obtained when possible.
RESULTS: We identified 113 patients (196 eyes) with uveitis and MS. Of these, 53 had a diagnosis of MS confirmed by review of neurological records, 50 additional patients fulfilled the Poser criteria for MS and 10 with MS were referred by an outside neurologist. Among them, 83 (73%) were women and the mean age of presentation was 40.6 years (range 13-64 years). The average visual acuity in affected eyes at presentation was 20/39. There were 90 patients (80%) who presented with intermediate uveitis and 24 patients (15%) with anterior uveitis. Posterior and pan-uveitis were found in four patients (3%) and two patients (2%), respectively. During a median follow-up of 3.2 years (range 0.04-21 years), visual acuity improved -0.09 logMar/year. Compared with our location-matched controls with idiopathic intermediate uveitis (n=16), patients with MS and intermediate uveitis were significantly older when diagnosed with uveitis (p=0.027) and more likely to be female (p=0.01). There was no statistical difference in visual acuity or rate of vision change between our cases and controls (p=0.58 and p=0.36, respectively).
CONCLUSIONS: Uveitis with MS generally presents as intermediate uveitis with a minority presenting with anterior uveitis. Patients are significantly older and more likely to be women than patients with idiopathic intermediate uveitis. The visual prognosis is generally favourable.",11,2015-Feb-1

The mechanism of uveitis following cataract surgery, which is mediated in part by the cyclooxygenase pathway, is complex, the complexity of which is likely to be due to several factors. We investigated the possible local involvement of interleukin 6 (IL-6) in this response. Using a specific bioassay, we showed a dramatic increase of IL-6 levels (> 4 x 10(3) times) in all of the aqueous humors of 12 patients following cataract surgery. The IL-6 levels in serum samples were below detection limits, indicating a local production of this cytokine. In addition, the injection of highly purified recombinant interleukin 6 in the anterior chamber of the eye in rabbits resulted in an inflammatory response. These observations suggest that IL-6 may play a crucial role in the occurrence of inflammation after cataract surgery, and it may lead to new therapeutic approaches to this problem.",11,1991-Dec-1

The intradermal administration of complete Freund's adjuvant (CFA) containing Mycobacterium butyricum to Sprague-Dawley (SD) and Lewis strain rats results in polyarthritis and uveitis. Over 90% of the eyes examined from the SD rats given CFA had histologic evidence of anterior uveitis, clinically evident in only 20 to 28%. Many rats developed arthritis without clinical uveitis, but uveitis was rare in the absence of arthritis. Histologically, the ocular inflammation was characterized by a polymorphonuclear, and later, a lymphocytic infiltration of the iris and ciliary body with cells and fibrinous exudate in the anterior chamber and cells in the vitreous. Antibodies and cellular immunity to ocular (S antigen, alpha crystallin), articular (type II collagen, proteoglycan) and bacterial components (MDP), were demonstrated in some rats, but positive tests did not correlate with either articular or ocular disease. Ten percent of rats given type II collagen in incomplete Freund's adjuvant developed uveitis. Thus, the pathogenesis of the arthritis and uveitis in the adjuvant model may be mediated by lymphocytes which exhibit crossreactivity with antigens in these structures, although the specificity of such antigens has not been identified in our studies.",11,1989-Apr-1

To describe the ophthalmologic features observed in patients infected by the human T-cell lymphotropic virus, type 1 (HTLV-1) in Martinique (French West Indies).
DESIGN: Prospective consecutive observational case series.
METHODS: A complete ophthalmic examination was performed.
PATIENTS: Of 200 patients infected by HTLV-1, 77 (38.5%) were seropositive and 123 (61.5%) had HTLV-1 associated myelopathy/tropical spastic paraparesis (HAM/TSP).
RESULTS: Uveitis was found in 29 cases (14.5%). Symptoms were mild and the uveitis had little effect on visual function. Ten cases of uveitis were discovered through a systematic examination and had no ocular symptoms. Most of the uveitis was anterior or intermediate. The lesions responded to corticosteroid therapy, but tended to recur. Keratoconjunctivitis sicca existed in 74 patients (37%), accompanied by lymphoplasmocytoid infiltration of the secondary salivary glands rated 3 or 4 on the Chisholm scale in nearly 50% of cases. Corneal alterations were observed in 20 cases (10%), and alterations in the retinal pigment epithelium in 3 cases.
CONCLUSION: The three types of ocular affections seen most frequently were uveitis, keratoconjunctivitis sicca, and interstitial keratitis. In patients with HAM/TSP, uveitis was more frequent among younger patients, patients with earlier onset of HAM/TSP, and patients with severe motor disability. Because uveitis is related to a high intrathecal production of immunoglobulin, it could represent a marker for severity of HTLV-1 infection with respect to the course of HAM/TSP. The sicca syndrome related to HTLV-1 virus differs from primary or secondary Sjögren syndrome, because it does not reveal any of the immunologic anomalies generally seen in this disease. Interstitial keratitis was more frequent among patients with HAM/TSP who had high proviral DNA levels.",11,2002-Aug-1

To evaluate the efficacy of spectral domain optical coherence tomography (SD-OCT) in monitoring the development of mouse experimental autoimmune uveoretinitis (EAU) as an animal model of endogenous uveitis, and to develop an OCT-based grading system for EAU severity.
METHODS: C57BL/6 mice were immunised with human interphotoreceptor retinoid-binding protein (amino acid sequence 1-20) peptide and complete Freund's adjuvant to induce EAU. The development of EAU was monitored by SD-OCT serially throughout the disease course, and the images were graded from 1 to 4 and compared with the clinical and histopathological grades.
RESULTS: SD-OCT images depicted retinal lamella structures including the inner segment/outer segment (IS/OS) line in normal mice. Retinal structural changes were observed on SD-OCT images in mice that developed EAU clinically scored as grade 1 or higher, which precisely corresponded to the pathological findings. The SD-OCT images of EAU were graded as follows: grade 1, a few infiltrating cells in the vitreous and retina; grade 2, increased vitreous cells, retinal vasculitis, and granulomatous lesion; grade 3, cell infiltration into the whole retina, disappearance of IS/OS line, and destruction of the retinal layer structure; and grade 4, disappearance of the outer retina. The SD-OCT grade of EAU based on these criteria correlated significantly with both the clinical grade (R(2)=0.282, p<0.005) and histopathological grade (R(2)=0.846, p<0.0001).
CONCLUSIONS: SD-OCT is useful for evaluating the development and severity of mouse EAU. The SD-OCT scoring system we developed accurately reflects clinical and histopathological changes.",11,2014-Jun-1

A single injection of an aqueous suspension of group A streptococcal peptidoglycan-polysaccharide complexes (PG-PS) when injected intraperitoneally into Lewis rats induced a self-limiting bilateral uveitis with associated perpetuating polyarthritis. The uveitis was characterized clinically during the first 72 h by iritis and fibrin deposition. Acutely, there was infiltration of polymorphonuclear cells. The symptoms gradually subsided, and at the close of the experiment eyes were normally clinically and histologically. In contrast, perpetuating inflammation and severe tissue injury developed in the limb. Using an enzyme immunoassay with specificity for the group A streptococcal polysaccharide, the levels of PG-PS in tissues of animals that were killed 1 to 7 days post-injection were measured. The relative amounts of antigen in eye:limb:liver of PG-PS injected animals were 1:9:170. The differences in the amounts of antigen detected in the eye and limb may help explain the development of the acute uveitis in contrast to the perpetuating polyarthritis observed on PG-PS administration. The authors suggest that bacterial debris may act similarly in causing ocular inflammation in man.",11,1986-Jun-1

Experimental autoimmune uveoretinitis was induced in genetically susceptible Lewis rats by passive transfer of T-lymphocyte cell lines from long-term cultures primed against soluble retinal antigen (S-Ag). A continuous T-cell line was established from non-adherent lymph node cells of S-Ag-immunized Lewis rats. The lymphoid cells were propagated in vitro by serially restimulating them with S-Ag in the presence of irradiated syngeneic spleen cells and expanding them in IL-2-containing media. The cell lines exhibited markers specific for T lymphocytes and the majority had the helper phenotype. When naïve rats were inoculated intravenously with anti S-Ag T-cell lines re-exposed to the antigen prior to injection, they developed uveoretinitis with both clinical and histological characteristics in half the time required by S-Ag to induce the disease by active immunization. The rats exhibited a delayed hypersensitivity skin reaction towards S-Ag.",11,1986-Apr-1

The membrane protein expression repertoire of cells changes in course of activation. In equine recurrent uveitis (ERU), a spontaneous autoimmune disease in horses with relapsing and ultimately blinding inner eye inflammation, CD4+ T lymphocytes are the crucial pathogenic cells activated in the periphery directly prior to an inflammatory episode. In order to find relevant changes in the membrane proteome associated to disease, we sorted CD4+ lymphocytes and compared protein abundance from the generated proteome datasets of both healthy horses and ERU cases. We detected formin like 1, a key player in actin dependent cellular processes such as phagocytosis, cell adhesion and cell migration, with significantly higher abundance in the CD4+ cell membrane proteome of horses with ERU. In transmigration experiments, we demonstrated higher migration rate of cells originating from diseased animals connecting formin like 1 to the migratory ability of cells. These findings are the first description of formin like 1 in association to processes involved in migration of inflammatory CD4+ T cells across the blood-retinal barrier in a spontaneous ocular autoimmune disease and suggest formin like 1 to play a role in the molecular mechanisms of ERU disease pathogenesis. Data are available via ProteomeXchange with identifier PXD005384.
BIOLOGICAL SIGNIFICANCE: This comparative proteomic study of membrane proteins of CD4+ T cells identified a novel protein, formin like 1, with expression on the plasma cell membrane of equine CD4+ T cells and a significant change of abundance on CD4+ T cells of horses with a spontaneous autoimmune disease. Functional studies in a cell culture model for transmigration at the blood-retinal barrier (BRB) unraveled a strong impact of formin like 1 on migratory processes of CD4+ T cells across the BRB, a key event in uveitis pathogenesis. These findings provide novel knowledge about changes in the CD4+ immune cell membrane proteome in a spontaneously and naturally occurring autoimmune disease in horses with high relevance for veterinary medicine. Additionally, this model has proven translational quality for human medicine and provides novel proteomic information on autoimmune uveitis in man.",11,2017-Feb-10

To determine the time to disease recurrence with long-acting injectable fluocinolone acetonide implant (FAi) for noninfectious intermediate, posterior, and panuveitis.
METHODS: This was a retrospective study of patients with at least 12 months of follow-up who had completed a 2-year prospective, investigational new drug study with 0.18-mg FAi. Time to uveitis recurrence or cystoid macular edema (CME) occurrence was recorded.
RESULTS: Twelve eyes from 12 participants (mean age 43 years, range 25-64 years) were included. Patients were followed for a mean of 34.2 months (range, 12.0-56.9 months) after completion of the prospective trial. Five eyes (42%) did not have a documented uveitis recurrence or CME occurrence. Five eyes (42%) had a uveitis recurrence with the mean time to recurrence 36.1 months (range, 22.8-61.1 months) after FAi implantation. Two eyes (16%) had CME alone, the mean time to occurrence 36.9 months (range 36.1-42.1 months). On Kaplan-Meier analysis, the estimated probability of remaining recurrence-free 36 months after FAi implantation was 0.67 (95% confidence interval, 0.34-0.86).
CONCLUSIONS: Data of study participants after completing a clinical trial suggest that the injectable FAi for noninfectious uveitis can provide control for 3 years on average. These long-term data support the use of FAi to control noninfectious uveitis.",11,2020-May-1

To compare the effects of straight, oblique, and double-plane tunnel scleral intravitreal injection techniques, on short-term intraocular pressure (IOP) changes, occurrence of vitreous reflux (VR), and/or other complications.
METHODS: A total of 105 patients were included in this prospective study. Patients were assigned randomly to one of the straight injection group (SI; n=35), oblique injection group (OI; n=35), or double-plane tunnel injection group (DPTI; n=35). The occurrence of VR and preinjection and postinjection IOP at 2 and 6 h were compared between groups, and complications were assessed.
RESULTS: The mean patient age was 71.1±6.6 years (range 58 to 86 years; 50 women and 55 men). In the SI, OI, and DPTI groups, VR occurred in 18 (51.4%), 12 (34.3%), and 6 patients (17.1%), respectively. Mean preinjection IOPs were 15.4, 14.8, and 15.6 mmHg, and changed to 17.3, 18.0, and 20.0 mmHg at the second hour, and 15.7, 16.2, and 16.1 mmHg at the sixth hour, respectively. No significant differences among the groups were found in terms of complications such as transient mild uveitis or subconjunctival hemorrhage.
CONCLUSION: Double-plane tunnel injection prevents VR from the injection site and has no additional complications than other techniques.",11,2013-Apr-1

Equine recurrent uveitis (ERU) is characterized by recurrent bouts of inflammation interrupted by periods of quiescence that vary in duration. There is little consensus on the clinical manifestations, the underlying causes, or the management. The 3 commonly recognized syndromes of ERU (classic, insidious, and posterior) do not accurately separate the clinical manifestations of disease into distinct categories. An accurate diagnosis and early intervention are essential to minimizing the effects of disease and preserving vision. There are multiple medical and surgical options for controlling ERU as long as the disease is recognized early and targeted treatment is initiated immediately.",11,2017-Dec-1

ᅟ: Behçet's disease (BD) is a systemic vasculitis characterised by a relapsing remitting course, affecting multiple organ systems. In the eye, it is a cause of potentially blinding inflammation in the form of uveitis. Management of uveitis in BD often requires the use of systemic immunosuppression, in order to reduce disease activity and prevent accumulation of irreversible damage. Whilst corticosteroids remain the mainstay of treatment, long-term use is limited by the development of adrenocorticotrophic side effects. There has therefore been significant interest in the use of corticosteroid-sparing immunosuppressive agents, and more recently, biologic therapies. Recent publications have demonstrated biologic therapy to have beneficial effects both on overall disease control, and quality of life for patients with BD. Widespread use of such agents is however limited, partly by the lack of high quality research evidence, and partly by the prohibitive cost of biologic treatments. In this review, we discuss the most recent research investigating the use of biologic therapy in uveitis due to BD, with consideration of health economics and quality of life outcomes.",11,2017-Jul-17

RESULTS: Of 196 members, 87 responded (44.4%), of whom 64 were affiliated with practices in North America, while 23 were outside of North America. The survey provided normative data on how physicians evaluate patients with uveitis as well as opinions about ocular TB. Responses varied widely on such issues as (1) the pretest probability that a patient with granulomatous panuveitis had TB uveitis (range 1-75%) or that a patient with a risk factor for TB had ocular TB (range 0-90%); (2) the optimal duration of anti-TB therapy; and (3) whether therapy should be discontinued after 2 months in nonresponders.

To investigate the clinical manifestations of human T-lymphotropic virus type-1 uveitis (HU), 112 HU patients who were followed up periodically for more than one year were retrospectively analyzed with respect to their ophthalmological and systemic complications. The gender ratio (female/male ratio) of the HU patients was 2.0 and the initial complications were foggy vision in 34.5%, ocular floaters in 33.3%, and blurred vision in 15.5%. As for the ocular symptoms, the majority (78.6%) of patients were classified as intermediate uveitis with vitreous inflammation. Recurrence of uveitis episodes was seen in one half of the patients (51.8%); 12 patients had more than six uveitis episodes. The interval of uveitis episodes varied from two weeks to 10 years. Nearly one half of the patients (43.8%) had ocular complications: e.g., cataract in 22 patients, persistent vitreous opacities in 17 patients, and glaucoma in 16 patients. Although the visual prognosis was essentially good, 11 patients had poor visual prognosis (<0.1). The causes of poor vision in these patients were cataract, cystoid macular edema, epiretinal membrane, and optic nerve atrophy. Of the 112 HU patients, two developed HTLV-I-associated myelopathy (TSP/HAM) after the onset of HU, while none developed adult T-cell leukemia. Sixteen HU patients had a previous history of Graves' disease and a past history of methimazole therapy, while Graves' disease was found in another HU patient only after HU onset and methimazole was not administered before the onset of HU. The present data of long-term follow-up indicate that (1) HU causes various ocular complications and its visual prognosis can be poor, (2) TSP/HAM can be induced even after the onset of HU, and (3) methimazole is not a risk factor of HU after Graves' disease.",11,2000-Dec-1

An 82-year-old white man had bilateral, chronic recurrent uveitis caused by Toxoplasma gondii. In spite of extensive therapy for toxoplasmosis, the left eye became painful and blind and was enucleated. Histopathologically, the retina disclosed unusually large numbers of necrotic cysts and a few presumably viable cysts containing crescent-shaped organisms and scanty free forms of T gondii. Electron-microscopic studies confirmed the presence of a true wall of the cysts as well as additional ultrastructural features highly characteristic of the parasite. Immunofluorescent studies of the formalin-fixed tissue demonstrated quite vividly the cysts, which stained variably according to the stage of viability of the organisms. In cases in which toxoplasmic retinochoroiditis has been suspected clinically but routine histologic preparations fail to reveal the organisms, the remaining formalin-fixed tissue should be examined by specific immunofluorescent methods to demonstrate antigenic material of the causative parasite.",11,1977-Feb-1

To assess the long-term effect of acetazolamide treatment on patients with cystoid macular edema (CME) in the course of intermediate or posterior chronic uveitis and to define those patients who may particularly benefit from the drug.
METHODS: Fifty-two eyes (45 patients) with chronic uveitic CME were treated with acetazolamide at an initial dosage of 500 mg/d. The effect of treatment was assessed by fluorescein angiography, ophthalmoscopy, visual acuity, and Amsler testing. Therapy was withdrawn when CME did not improve at 3 weeks. In cases with CME improvement, the dosage was gradually tapered.
RESULTS: The mean follow-up was 3.1 years (minimum, 1.5 years). Two subgroups were identified: group 1, quiescence of uveitis with acetazolamide as the single therapeutic agent (33 eyes); and group 2, chronically active uveitis requiring additional systemic antiinflammatory drugs (19 eyes). In both groups, visual acuity improvement was statistically significant (group 1, P = 0.012; group 2, P = 0.025). In 12 patients with a stable visual acuity gain, the medication dose could be tapered off completely without any recurrent edema shown by fluorescein angiography after a minimum follow-up of 1 year. Sixteen patients required a maintenance dosage, ranging from 125 to 500 mg daily. No major adverse effects of the medication were observed.
CONCLUSIONS: During long-term follow-up, low-dose acetazolamide can be a useful therapeutic option for chronic CME in uveitis. The effect was better in patients with quiescence of uveitis than in those with chronically active uveitis. Permanent therapy is not imperative in every case.",11,2005-1-1

A comparative study was carried out between cyclosporine and a new immunosuppressive agent, FK506, isolated from the Streptomyces organism. This agent has the capacities to suppress the development of S-antigen-induced experimental autoimmune uveoretinitis (EAU) as well as immune responses to S-antigen in rats immunized with the antigen. When administered daily beginning on the day of immunization and for 14 days thereafter, FK506 at doses between 0.1 and 1 mg/kg suppressed EAU in a dose-dependent manner. Complete inhibition of EAU was achieved at doses of 1, 3 and 10 mg/kg. Cyclosporine (1-20 mg/kg) also produced a dose-dependent suppression of EAU and only the highest dose (20 mg/kg) caused complete inhibition of the disease. On the basis of the dose-response study, the capacity of FK506 in preventing EAU induction is 10-30 times more intense than that of cyclosporine. In addition, the FK506 (1 and 3 mg/kg) was found to be effective in preventing EAU even when administered only in the early induction phase (days 0-5) or late effector phase (days 7-12). Similar effects were obtained by cyclosporine at a daily dose of 30 mg/kg. Furthermore, none of the rats immunized with S-antigen and treated with FK506 (1 mg/kg) on days 0-14 developed EAU when reimmunized with S-antigen on day 30. In contrast, similarly treated rats were fully susceptible to the induction of experimental allergic encephalomyelitis, or even to EAU when immunized with another retinal antigen, interphotoreceptor retinoid-binding protein. Therefore, as with cyclosporine, as demonstrated in our previous study, FK506 has the capacity to induce immunological unresponsiveness specific to the S-antigen.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)",11,1988-Aug-1

Data concerning the association of smoking and uveitis are limited. The aim of this study was to evaluate the effect of tobacco smoking on uveitis activity and complications of noninfections uveitis and the need for immunosuppressive therapy.
METHODS: We conducted an observational cross-sectional study in 350 patients with noninfectious uveitis. All patients completed a questionnaire concerning smoking habits. Primary outcome measure was uveitis activity in smokers as compared to nonsmokers; secondary outcome measures were need for immunosuppression and uveitis complications.
RESULTS: In all 115 patients (32.9%) were smokers. Smokers had an increased risk for active uveitis (OR 1.8; 95% CI, 1.2-2.9; p = 0.007). Smokers with anterior uveitis had anterior chamber cells more often than nonsmokers (p = 0.008) and required significantly more topical steroid eyedrops (p = 0.002). Uveitis developed at a younger age in smokers than in nonsmokers (p = 0.027). The number of smokers who needed any second-line immunosuppression (p = 0.642) and the number of immunosuppressive agents required (p = 0.794) did not differ from that for nonsmokers. The number of pack-years significantly increased the risk of macular edema (p = 0.020) und cataract (p = 0.022).
CONCLUSIONS: Smoking is associated with uveitis activity, leading to increased need for steroid eyedrops and increased incidence of cataract and macular edema. The results highlight the need to encourage uveitis patients to stop or at least to reduce their smoking.",11,2011-Jun-1

To describe the incidence of Posner-Schlossman syndrome (PSS) in Lucheng District, Wenzhou, China, over a 10-year period.
METHODS: We reviewed retrospectively the medical records of all inpatient and outpatient patients diagnosed with PSS during the years 2005-2014 in the Eye Hospital of Wenzhou Medical University. The keywords of 'glaucomatocyclitic crisis', 'Posner-Schlossman syndrome' and 'PSS' were used for the retrieval. Only patients with registered residing address in Lucheng District where the hospital located were finally selected. The cumulative incidence and annual incidence of PSS were calculated based on the sum of household registered population and temporary resident population in Lucheng District.
RESULTS: A total of 576 patients with PSS (339 men and 237 women) met the retrieval criteria. The mean age of these subjects at the first clinic visit was 40±15 years. Intraocular pressure (IOP) of the initial record was 31.91±15.37 mm Hg. The 10-year cumulative incidence of PSS in Lucheng District was 39.53 per 100 000 population, whereas the mean annual incidence of PSS in this area was 3.91 per 100 000 population. The majority of these patients were aged 20-59 years (83.9%). Men showed a significantly higher cumulative incidence of PSS than women (p=0.010). Higher rate of newly onset cases was found in spring (31%) than in other seasons (p=0.006).
CONCLUSIONS: Our results suggest a relatively high incidence of PSS in Wenzhou, a southeastern city in China. Young, male adults are prone to be affected in spring. However, the aetiology and other risk factors are still waited to be clarified.",11,2017-Dec-1

Presented in this series were seven men and three women. Ages when seen, ranged from 32 to 68 years (average 54). Psoriasis had begun in childhood in the women and in the late 20's and 30's in the men. Arthritis (ankylosing spondylitis) was present in only one. Their ocular inflammations began from ages 26 to 62 (average 41). The onset of the inflammation was acute iritis in four and in indolent iridocylcitis in six. All but one were bilateral and chronic. The vitreous had heavy debris in nine of the ten patients. The retina was normal in only three. Boggy congestion was present in two with cystoid edema. Patches of edema. fluorescein leaking, depigmentation of both maculae, pars plana exudate, and retinal vessel obliteration to grey-white, shaggy cords was present in at least one of the remaining five patients. Systemic corticosteroid therapy has been used in eight of the ten patients described in this report. Doses no higher than 30 mg of prednisone per day were used to initiate reversal of the inflammatory response. In case 10, knowledge of the sensitivity of the process to steroids led to the successful rapid reversal of a recalcitrant iritis with only 20 mg of prednisone as a first dose and 20 mg per day for less than three weeks. Maintenance corticosteroid therapy ranged from 40 mg of prednisone every other day in case 9, prednisone 12.5 mg one day and 5 mg the next in case 8, to 8 mg of Aristocort or methylprednisolone acetate (M-edrol) daily in cases 1 and 2. In summary, these patients are older, have an indolent onset bilateral uveitis with dense vitreous debris, retinal abnormalites, and are extremely sensitive to systemic corticosteroids. Many of these patients had undergone the series of clinical evaluations known as a ""uveitis survey."" Many different systemic abnormalities were found and merited treatment which rarely made a difference in their ocular disease, though two improved after infected teeth were treated. Assuming that these ocular diseases were related to psoriasis, one can then challenge the value of anything found by a ""uveitis survey."" The author uses information gained from such studies to insure that the patient is in the best possible heatlh and then makes clinical correlations such as presented in this paper. The rarity of this combination of ocular inflammations in patients with psoriasis makes it risky to propose that this is a significant association. Arguments that this is a disease entity began with the clinical similarities: older age, indolent onset, vitreous and retinal involvement, and the extreme sensitivity to systemic corticosteroids. None of these patients had psoriatic arthritis and only one had ankylosing spondylitis. The best explanation for the fact that this disorder has not been emphasized in the past would be an attitude of ophthalmologists and physicians that the eye and skin disease were coincident.",11,1979-1-1

P-selectin glycoprotein ligand-1 (PSGL-1) is constitutively expressed on leukocytes and was thought to be down-regulated with cell activation. However, this work shows the surprising finding of functional PSGL-1 up-regulation during acute inflammation. PSGL-1 function was studied in our autoperfusion assay, in which blood from a mouse carotid flows through a microchamber coated with a fixed density of P-selectin. Under the inflammatory conditions--uveitis induced by systemic lipopolysaccharide injection--we recorded significantly reduced leukocyte rolling velocity, which suggests PSGL-1 up-regulation; however, flow cytometry showed reduced PSGL-1. When bound leukocytes were released from the vasculature by PSGL-1 blockade, a large peripheral blood leukocyte (PBL) population showed elevated PSGL-1, which could account for the reduced PSGL-1 in the remaining unbound population. In the eye, systemic blockade of PSGL-1 with a monoclonal antibody or recombinant soluble PSGL-1 drastically reduced the severe manifestations of uveitis. Furthermore, PSGL-1 blockade was significantly more effective in reducing retinal leukostasis than was P-selectin blockade. Our results provide surprising evidence for functional PSGL-1 up-regulation in PBLs during acute inflammation. The temporal overlap between PSGL-1 and P-selectin up-regulation reveals an as yet unrecognized collaboration between this receptor-ligand pair, increasing efficiency of the first steps of the leukocyte recruitment cascade.",11,2009-Mar-1

To determine whether patients with juvenile systemic granulomatous disease (JSGD) (Blau syndrome) and uveitis have a characteristic ocular phenotype.
METHODS: Clinical and imaging data were collected retrospectively from patients attending the Regional Combined Paediatric Rheumatology and Ocular Inflammatory Service, Bristol Eye Hospital. General demographic information, laterality of the uveitis, age at onset, anatomical classification and course of the uveitis, clinical phenotype and specific NOD2 mutation were recorded for each patient.
RESULTS: Seventeen eyes from nine patients (five males; four females) were included in the study. Mean age at the disease onset was 15 months, range 1-84 months. Eight patients had bilateral uveitis. Anterior uveitis was present in five eyes, intermediate uveitis in two eyes, and there were 10 eyes with panuveitis, manifesting as multifocal choroiditis. Appearance of optic disc included indistinct disc margins in six eyes, optic nerve head pallor in six eyes, optic disc vessel sheathing in four eyes, and there was peripapillary hypo/hyperpigmentation in 13 eyes accompanied with characteristic peripapillary nodular excrescences. Among NOD2 mutations, the p.R334W was the most commonly detected (n: four cases), and three patients carried novel variants, the p.E338D and p.D390V variants in one patient, and the p.H520Y and p.Q809K variants in two different patients.
CONCLUSIONS: Chronic bilateral panuveitis and a nodular peripapillary appearance in childhood onset uveitis are characteristic features of JSGD, which support the need for an appropriate genetic NOD2 analysis.",11,2015-May-1

The aim of this review was to identify the imaging methods at our disposal to optimally manage posterior uveitis at the present time. The focus was put on methods that have become available since the 1990s, some 30 years after fluorescein angiography had revolutionised imaging of posterior uveitis in particular imaging of the retinal vascular structures in the 1960s. We have focussed our review on precise imaging methods that have been standardised and validated and can be used universally thanks to commercially produced and available instruments for the diagnosis and follow-up of posterior uveitis. The second part of this imaging review will deal with invasive imaging methods and in particular ocular angiography.",11,2021-Jan-1

To evaluate the heterogeneity of keratic precipitates (KP) in varying subtypes of uveitis by in vivo confocal microscopy (IVCM).
METHODS: The KP were viewed with a scanning confocal microscope in patients (n = 33) who sought care at a tertiary referral uveitis service for immune-mediated and infectious forms of uveitis, including HLA-B27-associated uveitis, sarcoidosis, Vogt-Koyanagi-Harada syndrome, juvenile chronic arthritis, Fuchs heterochromic iridocyclitis, cytomegalovirus retinitis, herpes zoster ophthalmicus, ocular toxoplasmosis, and idiopathic uveitis. Images were captured and digitalized in real time.
RESULTS: Forty-two eyes of 33 patients were examined in this study. Patient age ranged from 22 to 84 years, with a mean age of 49.4 years. Seventeen (52%) of the patients were women, and 16 patients (48%) were men. The KP ranged in diameter from 10 to 350 mum. We observed the following absolute and speculative outcomes: KP are markedly heterogeneous and variable as documented by IVCM; KP in individual patients are consistent throughout the cornea; the morphologic features of KP change across time; infectious vs noninfectious causes of uveitis seem to be readily distinguishable by using IVCM; and KP may have consistency for specific disease states and therefore may have diagnostic importance.
CONCLUSIONS: To our knowledge, this is the first time that IVCM has been used to describe the architecture and heterogeneity of KP in uveitis. Such observations reveal a heterogeneity that could not be appreciated by conventional slitlamp microscopy and may have diagnostic relevance.",11,2004-Dec-1

Cataract formation often occurs in people with uveitis. It is unclear which intraocular lens (IOL) type is optimal for use in cataract surgery for eyes with uveitis.
OBJECTIVES: To summarize the effects of different IOLs on visual acuity, other visual outcomes, and quality of life in people with uveitis.
SEARCH METHODS: We searched CENTRAL (which contains the Cochrane Eyes and Vision Group Trials Register) (The Cochrane Library 2013, Issue 7), Ovid MEDLINE, Ovid MEDLINE In-Process and Other Non-Indexed Citations, Ovid MEDLINE Daily, Ovid OLDMEDLINE (January 1946 to August 2013), EMBASE (January 1980 to August 2013), Latin American and Caribbean Literature on Health Sciences (LILACS) (January 1982 to August 2013), the metaRegister of Controlled Trials (mRCT) (www.controlled-trials.com), ClinicalTrials.gov (www.clinicaltrials.gov) and the WHO International Clinical Trials Registry Platform (ICTRP) (www.who.int/ictrp/search/en). We did not use any date or language restrictions in the electronic searches for trials. We last searched the electronic databases on 14 August 2013. We also performed forward and backward searching using the Science Citation Index and the reference lists of the included studies, respectively, in August 2013.
SELECTION CRITERIA: We included randomized controlled trials (RCTs) comparing hydrophobic or hydrophilic acrylic, silicone, or poly(methyl methacrylate) (PMMA) IOLs with or without heparin-surface modification (HSM), with each other, or with no treatment in adults with uveitis, for any indication, undergoing cataract surgery.
DATA COLLECTION AND ANALYSIS: We used standard methodological procedures expected by The Cochrane Collaboration. Two review authors screened the search results and for included studies, assessed the risk of bias and extracted data independently. We contacted study investigators for additional information. We did not perform a meta-analysis due to variability in reporting and follow-up intervals for the primary and secondary outcomes of interest.
MAIN RESULTS: We included four RCTs involving 216 participants (range of 2 to 140 participants with uveitic cataract per trial) and comparing up to four types of IOLs. The largest study was an international study with centers in Brazil, Egypt, Finland, France, Japan, the Netherlands, Slovak Republic, Spain, and the USA; two studies were conducted in Germany and one in Saudi Arabia. There was substantial heterogeneity with respect to the ages of participants and etiologies of uveitis within and across studies. The length of follow-up among the studies ranged from 1 to 24 months after cataract surgery. The studies were at low risk of selection bias, but two of the four studies did not employ masking and only one study included all randomized participants in the final analyses. The funding source was disclosed by investigators of the largest study (professional society) and not reported by the other three. Due to heterogeneity in lens types evaluated and outcomes reported among the trials, we did not combine data in a meta-analysis.In the largest study (140 participants), the study eye of each participant was randomized to receive one of four types of IOLs: hydrophobic acrylic, silicone, HSM PMMA, or unmodified PMMA. Proportions of participants with one or more Snellen lines of visual improvement were similar among the four treatment groups at one year' follow-up: 45 of 48 (94%) in the hydrophobic acrylic IOL group, 39 of 44 (89%) in the silicone IOL group, 18 of 22 (82%) in the HSM PMMA IOL group, and 22 of 26 (85%) in the unmodified PMMA IOL group. When comparing hydrophobic acrylic IOLs with silicone IOLs, the risk ratio (RR) was 1.06 (95% confidence interval (CI) 0.93 to 1.20). At one year' follow-up, fewer eyes randomized to hydrophobic acrylic IOLs developed posterior synechiae when compared with eyes receiving silicone IOLs (RR 0.18, 95% CI 0.04 to 0.79); the effects between these groups were less certain with respect to developing posterior capsule opacification (PCO) (RR 0.74, 95% CI 0.41 to 1.37), corneal edema (RR 0.49, 95% CI 0.22 to 1.12), cystoid macular edema (RR 0.10, 95% CI 0.01 to 1.84), or mild IOL decentration (RR 0.92, 95% CI 0.06 to 14.22).Two intra-individual studies also compared HSM PMMA IOLs with unmodified PMMA IOLs at three or six months of follow-up. These studies, including a combined total of 16 participants with uveitis, were insufficiently powered to detect differences in outcomes among eyes of people with uveitis randomized to receive HSM PMMA IOLs when compared with fellow eyes receiving unmodified PMMA IOLs.In the fourth study (60 participants), the study eye of each participant was randomized to receive a hydrophobic or hydrophilic acrylic IOL. At three months, there were no statistical or clinical differences between hydrophobic and hydrophilic acrylic IOL types in the proportions of participants with two or more Snellen lines of visual improvement (RR 1.03, 95% CI 0.87 to 1.22). There were similar rates in the development of PCO between hydrophobic or hydrophilic acrylic IOLs at six months' follow-up (RR 1.00, 95% CI 0.80 to 1.25). The effect of the lenses on posterior synechiae was uncertain at six months' follow-up (RR 0.50, 95% CI 0.05 to 5.22).None of the included studies reported quality of life outcomes.
AUTHORS' CONCLUSIONS: Based on the trials identified in this review, there is uncertainty as to which type of IOL provides the best visual and clinical outcomes in people with uveitis undergoing cataract surgery. The studies were small, not all lens materials were compared in all studies, and not all lens materials were available in all study sites. Evidence of a superior effect of hydrophobic acrylic lenses over silicone lenses, specifically for posterior synechiae outcomes comes from a single study at a high risk of performance and detection bias. However, due to small sample sizes and heterogeneity in outcome reporting, we found insufficient information to assess these and other types of IOL materials for cataract surgery for eyes with uveitis.",11,2014-Mar-04

To explore immunoregulatory and anti-inflammatory pathways specifically targeted by a subcutaneous anti-TNFαdrug-adalimumab-which might be relevant for controlling refractory uveitis.
DESIGN: Non-randomized pilot intervention study on the effects of adalimumab on Treg populations and plasma VEGF levels in refractory uveitis patients. Inflammatory and immunological parameters were measured in 12 patients before therapy, and 1 and 6 months after therapy, and analyzed in the context of ophthalmological outcomes. The results were compared with those obtained in 10 systemic prednisone-treated uveitis patients.
RESULTS: After 1 month of treatment, all patients responded, with 67% of adalimumab group and 80% of the corticosteroid group achieving inactivity (P=0.5). Unlike steroid-treated patients, a significant increase in T-regulatory CD4(+) CD25(high) Foxp3(+) CD127(-) cells was observed in adalimumab patients after 1 month of treatment, and maintained after 6 months (P=0.003). A significant adalimumab-specific drop in plasma VEGF was observed after 1 and 6 months of treatment (P=0.019). In every single patient, Tregs but not VEGF correlated with disease activity.
CONCLUSIONS: In refractory uveitis patients treated with adalimumab, clinical efficacy may be mediated through upregulation of Tregs in addition to modulation of VEGF-mediated inflammatory pathways. These biological properties, which were not observed in patients treated with corticosteroids, may reflect the specificity of TNF-αtargeting.",11,2012-Mar-1

Tuberculosis may be a lethal disease. Its ocular manifestations are commonly associated with severe difficulties in diagnosis and therapy; furthermore, it may cause blindness. DNA amplification methods may allow early detection of small amounts of Mycobacterium tuberculosis DNA to afford the possibility of prompt diagnosis. We evaluated a nested polymerase chain reaction (nPCR) assay for detection of Mycobacterium tuberculosis DNA in aqueous and vitreous.
METHODS: In a case-control study, 22 cases of diagnosed TB uveitis (three HIV-infected patients) and 38 controls (18 HIV-infected patients) with other types of uveitis (syphilis, nine; cytomegalovirus, seven; toxoplasmosis, five; herpes simplex, one; autoimmune vasculitis, eight; Vogt-Koyanagi-Harada, four; pars planitis, one; serpinginous choroiditis, one; Wegener granulomatosis, one; and Fuchs iridocyclitis, one studied). Samples from aqueous or vitreous were cultured and analyzed by nPCR for presence of M. tuberculosis nucleic acids. We used two sets of primers corresponding to IS6110 region coding for 219 bp and 123 bp DNA sequences.
RESULTS: Results were confirmed by Southern blot. All samples were tested by PCR simultaneously for Herpes simplex I, Herpes zoster, cytomegalovirus (CMV) and Toxoplasma gondii. nPCR was positive in 17 cases (77.2%) and only in three controls (8.8%) p = 0.022. All cultures were negative. Southern blot confirmed all positive nPCR tests. According to our definition of cases, there were five false negative results: two in patients with pulmonary tuberculosis; two in patients with tuberculous lymphadenitis, and one with positive skin test and hematuria. There were three cases considered false positives for nPCR: one with autoimmune vasculitis, and two with toxoplasmic uveitis.
CONCLUSIONS: nPCR for TB in ocular fluids was positive in the majority of cases of ocular TB. This method is useful in early confirmation of ocular tuberculosis.",11,2003-1-1

To compare the results of deep sclerectomy (DS) and trabeculectomy (TRAB) in the management of uveitic glaucoma.
METHODS: A retrospective chart review was carried out of 41 eyes (38 patients) operated on for uncontrolled uveitic glaucoma, 20 by DS with an implant and 21 by TRAB, with antiproliferative agents in both cases. Main outcome criteria were intraocular pressure (IOP), flare values, complications, and need for postoperative adjustments or re-operation.
RESULTS: Mean follow-up lasted 21.1+/-11.3 months in the TRAB group and 18.9+/-10.7 months in the DS group (P=0.184). Mean IOP did not differ significantly in the two groups on the day before surgery, at postoperative days 1 and 7, or at months 1, 6, and 12. At postoperative month 12, IOP values in the TRAB and DS groups were 12.4+/-4.3 and 11.7+/-3.3 mm Hg (P=0.688), respectively. The cumulative probability of success at 12 months was 89% for TRAB and 88% for DS (P=0.306). After DS, more postoperative adjustments were necessary to lower IOP than after TRAB (85 vs 9.5%, P<0.001), but 7 days after surgery, intraocular inflammation was higher after TRAB (245.8 vs 38.5 ph/ms, P<0.001).
CONCLUSIONS: DS and TRAB afforded equivalent IOP control in uveitic glaucoma. TRAB involved deeper invasion of the eye and resulted in more inflammation during the week after surgery, but successful DS required closer postoperative monitoring and more postoperative adjustments.",11,2010-Feb-1

To investigate aqueous cytokine profiles in acute anterior uveitis (AAU), Fuchs' syndrome, Vogt-Koyanagi-Harada (VKH) disease and Behcet's disease (BD), we assayed the concentrations of 17 cytokines by multiplex immunoassay in aqueous humor (AqH) collected during cataract surgery from 24 AAU, 29 Fuchs' syndrome, 29 VKH disease, 30 BD and 30 senile cataract control patients. Aqueous cytokine levels were compared between the five groups and analysed by logistic regression. Cytokine levels were then compared between uveitis patients who underwent cataract surgery within 3 months and those who underwent this surgery more than 3 months after complete control of intraocular inflammation. The results showed that aqueous levels of interferon (IFN)-γ, monocyte chemotactic protein (MCP)-1, macrophage inflammatory protein (MIP)-1β and tumour necrosis factor (TNF)-α levels in AqH from patients with Fuchs' syndrome were significantly higher than those in the other four groups. Using multivariate analysis, MIP-1β was found to be significantly associated with Fuchs' syndrome. There was no difference in aqueous cytokine levels between cases having cataract surgery within 3 months compared to those after 3 months of complete control of their intraocular inflammation. The current study shows that Chinese patients with Fuchs' syndrome appear to have a specific cytokine profile. MIP-1β is an important chemokine in the intraocular environment of Fuchs' syndrome. Aqueous cytokine profiles support the performance of cataract surgery in uveitis within 3 months after intraocular inflammation control.",11,2020-Jan-1

A severe unilateral granulomatous chorioretinitis with intralesional Halicephalobus deletrix was diagnosed. The horse developed progressive neurologic signs several days following the surgery to remove ocular contents and implant a prosthesis and was subsequently euthanatized. A severe multifocal granulomatous encephalitis with intralesional H. deletrix, localized primarily to the optic chiasm, thalamus, and brain stem, was diagnosed from tissues acquired at necropsy. The other eye was not affected. This is the first report of ocular parasitism by H. deletrix and suggests possible systemic dissemination from a primary site in the eye.",11,1995-Sep-1

Macular edema is one of the most common causes of permanent vision loss in patients with uveitis. The current understanding of water balance and metabolism within the retina has given us better insight into the mechanisms underlying macular edema arising from both acute and chronic inflammation. Uveitic macular edema (UME) occurs when the equilibrium between water influx and efflux is lost, and more importantly when compensatory mechanisms are overwhelmed. While in the acute setting, control of inflammation can reestablish homeostasis, chronic inflammation can lead to alternate pathways to establish a water balance. To understand UME, one must understand the regulation and consequences of inflammation at the tissular level. A fine interplay exists between inflammation and the retina replete with compensatory mechanisms, bystander effects, and structural sequelae once inflammation subsides. This understanding may allow us to develop new therapeutic strategies for the treatment of inflammatory macular edema.",11,2017-1-1

To describe the clinical characteristics and to assess visual prognosis of patients with syphilis-associated uveitis in northern Spain.
METHODS: Retrospective review of clinical records in eight general uveitis referral centers.
RESULTS: Since the year 2000, 50 patients have been diagnosed: 31 men and 19 women; median age was 41 (19-76) years. A total of 34% were co-infected with HIV and 24% presented systemic manifestations of syphilis. Median initial visual acuity and vision at last visit in 93 affected eyes was 20/50 (20/20-20/2000) and 20/22 (20/20-20/2000), respectively (p < .0001). The most frequent manifestation was papillitis (33.3%). Fifty percent of eyes with macular edema on admission presented worsening of visual acuity at last visit, whereas frequency of worsening in eyes without edema was 7.1% (p = 0.009).
CONCLUSIONS: In our series, patients with syphilitic uveitis were more usually middle-aged men and were frequently co-infected with HIV. Although most patients showed posterior segment involvement, visual prognosis was good.",11,2016-1-1

To investigate the relationship between recurrence of uveitis and timing of infliximab in patients with Behçet's disease.
METHODS: Charts were retrospectively reviewed for 23 patients with refractory uveoretinitis associated with Behçet's disease treated using infliximab at our hospital. Infliximab was administered by intravenous infusion at weeks 0, 2 and 6, and every 8 weeks thereafter. The relationship between recurrence of uveitis and infliximab infusion was analysed.
RESULTS: Mean duration of infliximab treatment for the 23 patients was 20 months, and the mean number of infliximab infusions was 12. Recurrent uveitis was seen during treatment in 13 of 23 patients, with no recurrences in the remaining 10 patients. Two patients developed recurrence soon after starting treatment-for example, first recurrence after starting infliximab was on day 19 or day 29, but the other 11 patients experienced recurrences after 5-6 months of infliximab treatment. As regards the timing of recurrences following infliximab infusion, 10 of the 13 patients developed recurrences ∼5 weeks after infliximab infusion. Recurrent uveitis in these patients most often occurred during weeks 7-8 after infusion. However, three of the patients developed recurrent uveitis at various times, for example in weeks 1, 4, 7 and 8 after infliximab infusion.
CONCLUSION: Infliximab is effective for suppressing recurrence of uveitis in Behçet's disease, but responses to infliximab differ among patients. Careful observation following infliximab infusion is necessary to manage the recurrence of uveitis during treatment.",11,2011-Feb-1

Detection and evaluation of inflammatory activity in uveitis is essential to the management of the condition, and yet continues to be largely dependent on subjective clinical measures. Optical coherence tomography (OCT) measurement of vitreous activity is an alternative to clinical vitreous haze scoring and has passed a number of early validation studies. In this study we aimed to evaluate the impact of 'operator factors' on the variability of the technique as part of the validation process, and to help evaluate its suitability for 'real world' use. Vitreous haze index was calculated as a ratio between the reflectivity of the vitreous and of the outer retina in each scan. Different scanning conditions were tested and their effect on the measurement is reported. Our results show that the 'quantitative imaging' technique of OCT-measured vitreous activity had good reliability in normal subjects under a range of 'real world' conditions, such as when the operator changes the averaging value. The technique was however vulnerable to highly inaccurate focussing or abnormal downward displacement of the image. OCT-based quantification of vitreous activity is a promising alternative to current subjective clinical estimates, with sufficient 'tolerance' to be used in routine clinical practice as well as clinical trials.",11,2018-Jan-26

To determine factors associated with the diagnosis of tuberculous uveitis and the response to anti-tuberculous treatment (ATT).
METHODS: A retrospective case study was performed at the University Medical Centre Utrecht between October 2007 and December 2009. Patients with possible tuberculous uveitis (TBU) were selected from all patients with an unexplained uveitis. Demographics, ethnicity, erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR), C-reactive protein (CRP), tuberculin skin test (TST), QuantiFERON (QFT) test, and ocular findings were evaluated. An interdisciplinary panel discussed if there was a presumed TBU and decided to start treatment. When there was a decrease in intraocular cell count and/or improvement in visual acuity after ATT, the confirmation of presumed TBU was made.
RESULTS: Of 585 patients with unexplained uveitis, 66 (11.3%) fulfilled the definition of possible TBU. Ten (15.4%) patients were regarded as having presumed TBU and received ATT. All of them had latent tuberculosis (LTB). The ocular situation improved in seven patients (70%). A history of TB contact, abnormalities on chest radiology, and extraocular manifestations of TB were associated with a good response to ATT in the case of presumed tuberculous uveitis.
CONCLUSIONS: Tuberculous uveitis remains difficult to diagnose. No clearly correlating factors that predicted the response to ATT, including ocular parameters, could be identified.",11,2013-Nov-1

Extravascular neutrophil migration is poorly characterized in vivo. To test the hypothesis that this migration is a non-random process, we used videomicroscopy to monitor neutrophils in irises of living mice with endotoxin-induced uveitis (EIU). Paths of individual cells were analyzed. Nearly all of these cells were moving in divergent directions, and mean displacement plots indicated that the predominant movement was random. The paths of some cells were fit to bivariate autoregressive integrated moving average models that revealed at least two modes of movement: random search and linear trend. Cell speed was significantly reduced by the actin inhibitor, cytochalasin D. The pattern of migration for neutrophils is in marked contrast to what we previously described for antigen-presenting cells in the iris, but somewhat resembles recent descriptions for T cells within a lymph node. Characterization of extravascular migration of neutrophils has important implications for understanding infection and immunity.",11,2008-Apr-1

Recent studies have provided new information concerning the development of autoimmune-mediated intraocular inflammation (uveitis) and the mechanisms that suppress this sight-robbing process. Newly collected data have led to several interesting advances: the discovery of additional uveitogenic antigens and novel uveitogenic reactions; dissection of the early steps of the pathogenic process; identification of the subsets of lymphocytes that selectively accumulate in the inflamed eye; analysis of the development of tolerance against sequestered antigens in the eye; elucidation of the cellular and molecular events of the anterior chamber-associated immune deviation, the major immunoregulatory mechanism in the eye; the capacity of this mechanism to inhibit and even treat uveitis; and examination of the mechanisms whereby oral tolerance inhibits ocular inflammation.",11,1994-Dec-1

In this retrospective cohort study we investigated the long-term course and visual outcomes of intermediate uveitis (IU).
METHODS: We performed an institutional study of patients with IU with a follow-up of at least 10 years, followed at a tertiary referral centre.
RESULTS: We studied 29 patients with unilateral or bilateral IU. The average age at onset of IU was 31 (range 8-64) years. At onset, three patients (10%) had associated systemic disease (two with sarcoidosis and one with multiple sclerosis) and one patient had granuloma annulare. During the follow-up period, one additional patient was diagnosed with sarcoidosis and one with multiple sclerosis. The percentage of eyes with legal blindness and visual impairment gradually increased over time (from 9/53 (17%) at onset to 15/53 (28%) at 10-year follow-up), with macular oedema, cataract and vitreous opacities being the most common causes of vision loss. The presence of associated anterior uveitis was more frequently noted in patients younger than 20 years at onset. Remissions of intraocular inflammation of at least 1 year were noted in 10/29 (34%) of patients. The mean time-to-remission was 8.6 years; patients who had remissions were younger at the onset of IU than those with ongoing active IU (p = 0.036). Remissions of IU showed borderline association with the absence of systemic disease (p = 0.046).
CONCLUSIONS: One-third of IU patients achieved a remission of their intraocular inflammation for longer than 1 year and had a mean time-to-remission of 8.6 years. Patients who were younger at onset of IU were more likely to achieve remission than those who were older at onset.",11,2009-Apr-1

To perform a quantitative analysis of choriocapillaris (CC) flow deficits (FDs) in patients with uveitis.
DESIGN: Retrospective cross-sectional study.
METHODS: Swept-source optical coherence tomography based angiography (SS-OCTA) macular volume scans (3 × 3 mm and 6 × 6 mm) were obtained using the Plex Elite 9000. En face CC images were generated and analyzed using an automated FD identification algorithm. Three quantitative metrics were determined for each eye: FD number (FDN), mean FD size (MFDS), and FD density (FDD). Quantitative metrics were compared between uveitis and control eyes. The uveitis cohort was further subdivided by the presence or absence of choroidal involvement, and quantitative metrics were compared between subgroups and normal control subjects.
RESULTS: A total of 38 eyes from 38 control subjects and 73 eyes from 73 uveitis subjects were included in this study. Eyes with uveitis have significantly larger CC MFDS (3- × 3-mm scans; P < .0001; 6- × 6-mm scans; P < .0001) and higher FDD (P = .0002; P = .0076, respectively) compared to control eyes. Additional analysis determined that these differences were due to the choroidal disease subgroup, which demonstrates significantly larger MFDS (3 × 3 = 1,108 μm
CONCLUSIONS: Automated quantification of CC can identify pathological FDs and provide quantitative metrics describing such lesions in patients with uveitis. Posterior uveitis patients have significantly larger CC FDs than patients with other forms of uveitis.",11,2020-Oct-1

Sympathetic ophthalmia is a rare, bilateral granulomatous panuveitis following accidental or surgical trauma to one eye. The pathophysiology is not clearly understood, but is believed to be a T-cell mediated autoimmune response. Clinical presentation most often occurs within the first year after trauma; anteriorly it manifests as a chronic or acute uveitis with mutton-fat keratic precipitates, while posteriorly it is often accompanied by yellowish-white choroidal lesions or Dalen-Fuchs nodules. The mainstay of treatment consists of systemic anti-inflammatory agents such as oral corticosteroids, or other immunosuppressive agents. Newer treatments include intravitreal injections of steroids in combination with systemic therapy, periocular injections of steroids without systemic therapy, and injections of infliximab, an anti-vascular endothelial growth factor.",11,2011-1-1

To investigate the hypothesis that lymphopenia is an independent predictor of sarcoidosis in new patients presenting with uveitis.
PATIENTS AND METHODS: Retrospective case-control study of 112 patients with sarcoidosis-associated uveitis (SAU) against 398 controls with other forms of uveitis.
RESULTS: Of the patients with SAU, 30/112 (26.8%) had significant lymphopenia (<1.0×10(9)/L), compared with 24/398 (6.0%) for other uveitis (p≤0.0001, OR 5.7 (95% CI 3.2 to 10.3)). The mean lymphocyte count for patients with SAU was 1.43 vs 2.04 for other uveitis (p≤0.0001). Logistic regression modelling using diagnosis of SAU as the independent variable identified age, ACE levels and lymphocyte count as independent predictors of SAU. A new patient with uveitis with significant lymphopenia has a risk of sarcoidosis (from this parameter alone) of 31.6%.
CONCLUSIONS: Significant lymphopenia (<1.0×10(9)/L) is an independent predictor of sarcoidosis in new patients presenting with uveitis. We recommend that diagnostic criteria for SAU should be modified to include this phenomenon.",11,2016-Oct-1

Ankylosing spondylitis (AS) is generally observed in young patients but can occur later in life or in persons ≥ 50 years of age. Our objective was to characterize the clinical features of late-onset AS in a large multicenter national cohort.
METHODS: We studied late-onset AS in the National Registry of Spondyloarthritis of the Spanish Society of Rheumatology (REGISPONSER database) cohort (n = 1257), of whom 3.5% had onset at age ≥ 50 years versus a control group with onset at < 50 years.
RESULTS: There were no differences between late-onset and early-onset AS according to sex and family history of spondyloarthropathies. Patients in the late-onset group more often showed involvement of the cervical spine (22.7% vs 9.7%; p = 0.03) and arthritis of the upper (13.6% vs 3.0%; p = 0.002) and lower limbs (27.3% vs 15.2%; p = 0.03) as first manifestations than did patients in the early-onset group. A higher percentage of mixed forms (axial and peripheral joint disease) during the course of the disease was also recorded in the late-onset group (50% vs 24%; p = 0.0001).
CONCLUSION: Our study suggests that age at onset of AS affects the patients' presenting clinical form. Arthritis of the upper limbs requires a differential diagnosis with other conditions frequent in patients over 50 years of age, such as rheumatoid arthritis or crystal-induced arthropathy.",11,2012-May-1

Fuchs' uveitis is very often diagnosed with substantial delay, which is at the origin of deleterious effects such as unnecessary treatment and its consequences. The aim of this study was to analyse the type and frequency of posterior inflammatory and fluorescein angiographic signs in Fuchs' uveitis in conjunction with other clinical signs. Patients seen at the Centre for Ophthalmic Specialised Care (COS) in Lausanne and the Memorial A. de Rothschild, Clinique Générale-Beaulieu in Geneva between 1995 and 2008 with the diagnosis of Fuchs' uveitis and who had undergone a fundus fluorescein angiography (FFA) were analysed. In addition to FFA signs, the data collected included age, gender, initial and final visual acuities, clinical findings at presentation, mean diagnostic delay and ocular complications. Between 1995 and 2008, 105 patients seen in our centres in Lausanne and Geneva were diagnosed with Fuchs' uveitis. Forty of them (38.1%) had undergone at least one FFA. One patient was excluded because of a concomittant diagnosis of multiple sclerosis. In 28 of 39 patients (71.2%) diagnosis was not reached at presentation with a mean diagnosis delay of 3.67 ± 4.86 years (range: 1 month-24 years). The original erroneous diagnosis was intermediate uveitis in 16 patients (57.1%), posterior uveitis in two patients (7.1%), panuveitis in four patients (14.3%) and anterior granulomatous uveitis in six patients (21.4%). Fluorescein angiography demonstrated the presence of disc hyperfluorescence in 43/44 eyes (97.7%), sectorial peripheral retinal vascular leaking in 6/44 eyes (13.6%) and cystoid macular oedema in 4/44 eyes (9.1%), all of which were seen in eyes having undergone cataract surgery. Fuchs' uveitis was bilateral in 5/39 patients (12.8%). The most frequent clinical signs were vitritis in 42/44 eyes (95.5%), stellate keratic precipitates in 41 eyes (93.2%), posterior subcapsular opacities or cataract in 19 eyes (43.2%), and heterochromia in 19 eyes (43.2%). Fuchs' uveitis is a largely underdiagnosed uveitis, probably because the predominant vitreous involvement is ignored by many ophthalmologists. In addition, the nearly constant inflammatory fluorescein angiography findings reported here such as disc hyperfluorescence and, more rarely, peripheral retinal vascular leaking, are not well known and are not usually associated with Fuchs' uveitis but represent an additional factor leading to misdiagnosis. These findings need to be recognised in order to reduce diagnostic delay.",11,2010-Oct-1

Twenty-two Japanese patients with glaucomatocyclitic crisis were typed for HLA-A, HLA-B, and HLA-C antigens to detect the immunogenetic factors in this disease. It was shown that HLA-Bw54 was present in nine (41%) of 22 patients, a significant increase even after correcting the P value for the number of antigens studied. The haplotype frequency of HLA-Bw54-Cw1 showed a significant association, and it was not due to linkage disequilibrium in the Japanese. Our results suggest that immunogenetic factors closely associated with the major histocompatibility complex may play an important role in the pathogenesis of glaucomatocyclitic crisis.",11,1985-Dec-1

The purpose of this review is to provide a framework to distinguish Blau syndrome/Early Onset Sarcoidosis and Sarcoidosis clinically. We also discuss relevant differences in genetics, pathogenesis, and management of these diseases.
RECENT FINDINGS: Blau syndrome and Sarcoidosis share the characteristic histologic finding of noncaseating granulomas as well as some similar clinical characteristics; nevertheless, they are distinct entities with important differences between them. Blau syndrome and Early Onset Sarcoidosis are due to one of numerous possible gain-of-function mutations in NOD2, commonly presenting before age 5 with a triad of skin rash, arthritis, and uveitis. However, as more cases are reported, expanded clinical manifestations have been described. In systemic Sarcoidosis, there are numerous susceptibility genes that have been identified, and disease is thought to result from an environmental exposure in a genetically susceptible host. It most often presents with constitutional symptoms and pulmonary involvement and typically affects adolescents and adults. This paper reviews the similarities and differences between Blau syndrome and Sarcoidosis. We also discuss the importance of distinguishing between them, particularly with regard to prognosis and outcomes.",11,2021-Feb-09

Endotoxin-induced uveitis (EIU), a useful animal model of ocular inflammation, is induced by injection of lipopolysacharide (LPS). These experiments showed that the nitric oxide (NO) level significantly increased in the whole eye homogenate of BALB/C mice 24 h after footpad injection of LPS at a dosage of 100 mg/mouse. However, the elevated NO level was significantly reduced by oral administration of bilberry extract (containing 42.04% anthocyanins) at dosages of 50, 100, and 200 mg/kg/day for 5 days before the LPS injection. In addition, bilberry extract decreased malondialdehyde (MDA) level and increased oxygen radical absorbance capacity (ORAC) level, glutathione (GSH) level, vitamin C level, and total superoxide dismutase (SOD) and glutathione peroxidase (GPx) activities. Moreover, bilberry extract increased expression of copper/zinc superoxide dismutase (CuZnSOD), manganese superoxide dismutase (MnSOD), and GPx mRNA. Taken together, bilberry extract showed protective effects against EIU, whereas the effects of bilberry extract (100 and 200 mg/kg/day, 5 days) were dose-dependent. In conclusion, these results provide new evidence to elucidate the beneficial effects of bilberry extract on eye health.",11,2010-Apr-28

Autoimmune uveitis is a major cause of vision loss and glucocorticoids are major traditional medications, which may induce serious complications. Rapamycin has been demonstrated to exhibit immunosuppressive effects and is promising to be used in treating uveitis by intravitreal injection. However, repeated and frequent intravitreal injections increase the risk of severe ocular complications, while the efficacy of subconjunctival injection of rapamycin is low since it is difficult for rapamycin to penetrate eyeball. Recently, small extracellular vesicles (sEVs) have attracted considerable research interest as natural drug delivery systems that can efficiently cross tissues and biological membranes. SEVs derived from mesenchymal stem cells (MSC-sEVs) also can exert immunosuppressive effect and ameliorate experimental autoimmune uveitis (EAU). The aim of this study was to construct a Rapamycin-loaded MSC-sEVs delivery system (Rapa-sEVs) and investigate its therapeutic effect on EAU by subconjunctival injection. Rapa-sEVs were prepared by sonication and characterized by nanoparticle tracking analysis, transmission electron microscopy, and western blotting. Clinical and histological scores were obtained to assess the treatment efficacy. Additionally, T cell infiltration was evaluated by flow cytometry. The results indicated that Rapa-sEVs could reach the retinal foci after subconjunctival injection. Compared to sEVs and rapamycin alone, Rapa-sEVs can produce a more marked therapeutic effect and reduce ocular inflammatory cell infiltration. Overall, MSC-sEVs have significant potential for the delivery of rapamycin to treat EAU. Subconjunctival injection of Rapa-sEVs may be contender for efficacious steroid-sparing immunomodulatory therapy.",11,2022-1-1

To validate a photographic vitreous haze grading technique using a 9-step logarithmic scale in patients enrolled in a randomized, controlled clinical trial in uveitis.
DESIGN: Retrospective study of clinical trials methodology.
SETTING: University-based department of ophthalmology.
STUDY POPULATION: Baseline fundus photographs of patients with intermediate uveitis, posterior uveitis, or panuveitis enrolled in the Multicenter Uveitis Steroid Treatment (MUST) trial.
OBSERVATIONAL PROCEDURE: Grading of vitreous haze using a previously described photographic scale. Regrading of a subset of photographs to assess intraobserver agreement.
MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Interobserver and intraobserver intraclass correlation for photographic haze grading, and correlation between photographic and clinical vitreous haze scores, assessment of the clinical findings that significantly affect the photographic haze score.
RESULTS: Vitreous haze was graded in 271 eyes (142 patients) by 3 postgraduate ophthalmologists. The interobserver and intraobserver intraclass correlations were excellent, with correlation coefficients between 0.84 and 0.93. There was moderately strong correlation between the photographic and clinical vitreous haze scores (r=0.51; P<.001), with significant differences among the mean and median photographic haze scores for the 3 lowest clinical grades of haze, 0, 1+, and 2+. Other parameters that correlated with photographic vitreous haze score included visual acuity of 20/50 or worse (P=.003), degrees of posterior synechiae (P<.001), lens abnormality (P=.023) or posterior capsule obscuration (P=.001), and amount of anterior vitreous cell (P=.002).
CONCLUSIONS: Photographic grading of vitreous haze with a 9-step logarithmic scale is a highly reproducible methodology that may be adaptable to use in future clinical trials.",11,2011-Aug-1

Serological techniques are an essential part of the diagnostic tools used in clinical virology. Among these techniques, antibody indexes are not novel, but do require specific expertise. Their niche has expanded substantially in recent years due to increasing evidence of their performance to diagnose viral infections.
OBJECTIVES: This narrative review describes the background and clinical applications of antibody indexes. The first objective is to provide an overview of the theoretical background, insights for implementation, limitations and pitfalls. The second objective is to review the available evidence for the diagnostic performance, with a specific focus on viral encephalitis and uveitis.
SOURCES: A comprehensive literature search was performed in PubMed, including original studies and reviews, with no time limit on the studies included. The following search terms were used: antibody index, Goldmann-Witmer coefficient, Reibergram, viral encephalitis, viral uveitis, herpes simplex virus, varicella zoster virus, cytomegalovirus, Epstein-Barr virus, rubella virus, measles virus, enterovirus, influenza virus, flaviviruses.
CONTENT: Antibody indexes can support the diagnosis of a spectrum of viral infections in immune privileged sites such as the central nervous system and the eye, through the demonstration of virus-specific intrathecal or intraocular antibody production. This is especially useful in situations where PCR has a lower positivity rate: infections with rapid viral clearance due to natural immunity or treatment and chronic stages of viral infections.
IMPLICATIONS: Antibody indexes expand the clinical microbiologist's diagnostic toolbox. Careful interpretation of the results of these assays is crucial and further standardization of methods is required to improve interchangeability of results between laboratories.",11,2021-Sep-1

Behcet's disease (BD) is an inflammatory disorder that is mainly characterized by recurrent oral and genital ulcers, skin lesions, and uveitis. Recent reports focused on the genetic factors of susceptibility to this disease and especially the TNF in view of the major role played by this proinflammatory cytokine in the lesional process of Behcet's disease. In this report, we investigated the possible association between Behcet's disease and the TNF-alpha gene promoter polymorphisms -1031T/C, -308A/G, and the TNF-beta polymorphism +252A/G in Tunisian population. We compared the distribution of these polymorphisms between 89 BD patients and 157 healthy controls using polymerase chain reaction restriction fragment length-polymorphism (PCR-RFLP) analysis. The frequency of the TNF-alpha -1031C allele was significantly higher in Behcet's patients than in healthy controls (p = 0.015; chi(2) = 5.84; OR = 1.65; 95% CI = 1.08-2.54), whereas the frequencies of the TNF-alpha -308G and the TNF-beta +252G alleles were similar in the two compared groups.

To describe the prevalence of extra-articular disease (uveitis, psoriasis and inflammatory bowel disease [IBD]), in a cohort of patients with spondyloarthritis (SpA).
PATIENTS AND METHODS: AQUILES is an observational, prospective and multicentric study of three cohorts of patients with one of the following immune-mediated inflammatory diseases (IMID): SpA, psoriasis, or IBD. In the present cohort, patients ≥18 years of age with SpA were enrolled from Rheumatology clinics. The main objective was to assess the coexistence of these diseases and of uveitis, based on the patients' clinical history up to the study entry.
RESULTS: A total of 601 patients with SpA (men: 63.1%; women: 36.9%) were enrolled. The specific diagnoses were: ankylosing spondylitis (55.1%), psoriatic arthritis (25.1%), undifferentiated spondyloarthritis (16.1%), enteropathic arthritis (2.5%), and others (1.3%). In 43.6% (95% CI: 39.7-47.6) of the patients, at least one of the three abovementioned diseases was encountered, predominantly psoriasis (prevalence 27.8%, 95% CI: 24.4-31.5), uveitis (13.6%, CI 95%: 11.1-16.6) and IBD (5.1%, 95% CI: 3.7-7.2). In patients with ankylosing spondylitis the proportion of other disease was 25.3% (IBD: 3.9%, psoriasis: 5.4%, uveitis: 19.0%) whilst it was 94.7% in psoriatic arthritis, due to the presence of psoriasis (94.0%). The coexistence of these diseases was associated with age, female gender and the presence of other extra-articular manifestations associated with SpA.
CONCLUSIONS: Extra-articular disease in patients with SpA is common and, in this study, it was associated to age, female gender and the presence of other SpA-related extra-articular manifestations.",11,2015-1-1

This study investigated the levels of interleukin (IL)-8, IL-10, and vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) in the aqueous humor (AqH) of patients with Behçet's uveitis (BU) and Fuchs' uveitis syndrome (FUS) during an inactive period and compared these levels with those in the AqH of noninflammatory healthy control subjects.
METHODS: This prospective and case-control study included 33 patients (16 patients with BU and 17 patients with FUS) and 35 control subjects. IL-8, IL-10, and VEGF levels in the AqH were quantified by performing sandwich enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. Kruskal-Wallis test was used to compare the cytokine levels in the different groups, and statistical significance was set at p < 0.05.
RESULTS: IL-8 levels were significantly higher in the AqH of patients with BU and FUS than in the AqH of control subjects (p < 0.001 and p < 0.001, respectively). IL-10 levels were significantly lower in the AqH of patients with BU than in the AqH of patients with FUS and of control subjects (p = 0.001 and p < 0.001, respectively). Although VEGF levels were higher in the AqH of patients with FUS than in the AqH of patients with BU and of control subjects, the difference was significant only between patients with FUS and control subjects (p < 0.001).
CONCLUSIONS: We observed a significant decrease in IL-10 levels in the AqH of patients with BU and a significant increase in VEGF levels in the AqH of patients with FUS compared to controls. IL-8 and VEGF levels showed no significant difference among uveitis patients.",11,2019-Nov-1

To evaluate the potential of gene therapy with a recombinant adeno-associated virus vector encoding the interleukin-1 receptor antagonist gene (rAAV-IL-1Ra) in the treatment of experimental uveitis.
METHODS: The vitreal cavity of New Zealand white rabbits was injected with rAAV-IL-1Ra (4x10(7) infectious units), and the contralateral eye was injected with the same amount of rAAV-LacZ or PBS as a control. Transgene expression was evaluated by immunohistochemistry, ELISA, and RT-PCR. To evaluate the therapeutic potential of rAAV-IL-1Ra, experimental uveitis was induced by intravitreal injection of IL-1alpha at 10 and 100 days after rAAV-IL-1Ra administration. The effects of rAAV-IL-1Ra on experimental uveitis were investigated using histological and aqueous analysis.
RESULTS: Following intravitreal injection of rAAV-IL-1Ra, transgene expression was found in various cell types of the ocular tissues, such as ciliary epithelial cells, retinal ganglion cells, and retinal pigment epithelial cells. RT-PCR and ELISA showed that the IL-1Ra transgene persisted in the rabbit eye for at least 100 days. Compared with the control eyes, the transgene expression ameliorated experimental uveitis at 10 and 100 days after a single administration of rAAV-IL-1Ra.
CONCLUSIONS: Intravitreal administration of rAAV-IL-1Ra led to sustained human IL-1Ra transgene expression in rabbit eyes for 100 days. The transgene expression suppressed uveitis episodes at 10 and 100 days after rAAV-IL-1Ra injection. Long-term suppression of experimental uveitis could be achieved by gene therapy with rAAV-IL-1Ra.",11,2009-Aug-08

Uveitis is occasionally encountered in multiple sclerosis (MS) patients. The objective of this report is to investigate whether uveitis has a prognostic impact on the clinical course of MS. Several clinical and demographic features were compared between 41 MS patients with uveitis and 100 randomly selected MS patients without uveitis. While there were no significant differences by means of gender, age of MS onset, oligoclonal band positivity and disease duration, EDSS and progression index (PI) scores of MS patients with uveitis were significantly lower than those without uveitis (p = 0.004 and <0.001, respectively).

To report the safety and efficacy of tocilizumab in patients with severe and refractory non-infectious uveitis.
METHODS: Eight consecutive unselected patients with severe and refractory non-infectious uveitis [Birdshot chorioretinopathy (n=1), Behçet's disease (n=1) and idiopathic bilateral panuveitis (n=6)] treated with tocilizumab (8mg/kg every 4 weeks intravenously) were included. The primary outcome was the response to treatment, defined by decrease of inflammatory ocular signs.
RESULTS: Four (50%) patients were of female gender and the median (IQR) age was 41 (31-47) years. The median number of previous immunosupressants was of 5.5 (4-6.7). Seven patients had been previously treated with anti-TNF-α [infliximab (n=5) and adalimumab (n=2)]. The immunosupressive drugs used in association with tocilizumab were azathioprine (n=2), mycophenolate mofetil (n=2) and methotrexate (n=2). After a median follow-up of 8 months (6-25), 6/8 (75%) improved under tocilizumab and 2 (25%) were non-responders. The visual acuity improved in five patients. The median dose of prednisolone decreased from 16mg/day (10.6-20.5) to 10 mg/day (10-13.7), at baseline and at the end of follow-up, respectively. Tolerance of tocilizumab was satisfactory and side effects included bronchitis (n=1) and grade 1 leukopenia (n=1) and thrombocytopenia (n=1).

Uveitis models in rodents are important in the investigation of pathogenesis in human uveitis and the development of appropriate therapeutic strategies for treatment. Quantitative monitoring of ocular inflammation in small animal models provides an objective metric to assess uveitis progression and/or therapeutic effects. We present a new application of optical coherence tomography (OCT) and OCT-based microangiography (OMAG) to a rat model of acute anterior uveitis induced by intravitreal injection of a killed mycobacterial extract. OCT/OMAG is used to provide noninvasive three-dimensional imaging of the anterior segment of the eyes prior to injection (baseline) and two days post-injection (peak inflammation) in rats with and without steroid treatments. OCT imaging identifies characteristic structural and vascular changes in the anterior segment of the inflamed animals when compared to baseline images. Characteristics of inflammation identified include anterior chamber cells, corneal edema, pupillary membranes, and iris vasodilation. In contrast, no significant difference from the control is observed for the steroid-treated eye. These findings are compared with the histology assessment of the same eyes. In addition, quantitative measurements of central corneal thickness and iris vessel diameter are determined. This pilot study demonstrates that OCT-based microangiography promises to be a useful tool for the assessment and management of uveitis in vivo.",11,2015-Jan-1

Children with juvenile idiopathic arthritis (JIA) are at risk of uveitis. The role of adalimumab (Humira
OBJECTIVE: To compare the efficacy, safety and cost-effectiveness of adalimumab in combination with methotrexate (MTX) versus placebo with MTX alone, with regard to controlling disease activity in refractory uveitis associated with JIA.
DESIGN: This was a randomised (applying a ratio of 2 : 1 in favour of adalimumab), double-blind, placebo-controlled, multicentre parallel-group trial with an integrated economic evaluation. A central web-based system used computer-generated tables to allocate treatments. A cost-utility analysis based on visual acuity was conducted and a 10-year extrapolation by Markov modelling was also carried out.
SETTING: The setting was tertiary care centres throughout the UK.
PARTICIPANTS: Patients aged 2-18 years inclusive, with persistently active JIA-associated uveitis (despite optimised MTX treatment for at least 12 weeks).
INTERVENTIONS: All participants received a stable dose of MTX and either adalimumab (20 mg/0.8 ml for patients weighing < 30 kg or 40 mg/0.8 ml for patients weighing ≥ 30 kg by subcutaneous injection every 2 weeks based on body weight) or a placebo (0.8 ml as appropriate according to body weight by subcutaneous injection every 2 weeks) for up to 18 months. A follow-up appointment was arranged at 6 months.
MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Primary outcome - time to treatment failure [multicomponent score as defined by set criteria based on the Standardisation of Uveitis Nomenclature (SUN) criteria]. Economic outcome - incremental cost per quality-adjusted life-year (QALY) gained from the perspective of the NHS in England and Personal Social Services providers. Full details of secondary outcomes are provided in the study protocol.
RESULTS: A total of 90 participants were randomised (adalimumab, 
CONCLUSIONS: Adalimumab in combination with MTX is safe and effective in the management of JIA-associated uveitis. However, the likelihood of cost-effectiveness is < 1% at the £30,000-per-QALY threshold.
FUTURE WORK: A clinical trial is required to define the most effective time to stop therapy. Prognostic biomarkers of early and complete response should also be identified.

To evaluate the efficacy and safety of biologic response modifiers (BRMs) in the treatment of patients with psoriatic ocular inflammatory disease.
METHODS: The records of 8 patients diagnosed with psoriatic ocular inflammatory disease who received adalimumab or infliximab were reviewed. Main outcome measures were control of intraocular inflammation, visual acuities, and adverse effects of therapy.
RESULTS: The mean patient age was 53 +/- 15 years. Three patients had psoriatic panuveitis, 3 had psoriatic scleritis, and 2 patients had psoriatic anterior uveitis. The ocular inflammatory disease was bilateral in 7 patients. Four patients received adalimumab, and 4 received infliximab. Average time of therapy was 6.1 +/- 4.7 months. Six patients were treated concurrently with methotrexate. With respect to visual acuity, 2 patients demonstrated improvement, 2 patients demonstrated deterioration, and 4 patients remained stable. Seven patients achieved remission of their ocular inflammation.
CONCLUSIONS: BMRs can be a useful adjunctive therapy for psoriatic ocular inflammatory disease.",11,2008-1-1

Granulocyte colony-stimulating factor (G-CSF) is a regulator of neutrophil production, function, and survival. Herein, we investigated the role of G-CSF in a murine model of human uveitis-experimental autoimmune uveoretinitis. Experimental autoimmune uveoretinitis was dramatically reduced in G-CSF-deficient mice and in anti-G-CSF monoclonal antibody-treated, wild-type (WT) mice. Flow cytometric analysis of the ocular infiltrate in WT mice with experimental autoimmune uveoretinitis showed a mixed population, comprising neutrophils, macrophages, and T cells. The eyes of G-CSF-deficient and anti-G-CSF monoclonal antibody-treated WT mice had minimal neutrophil infiltrate, but no change in other myeloid-derived inflammatory cells. Antigen-specific T-cell responses were maintained, but the differentiation of pathogenic type 17 helper T cells in experimental autoimmune uveoretinitis was reduced with G-CSF deficiency. We show that G-CSF controls the ocular neutrophil infiltrate by modulating the expression of C-X-C chemokine receptors 2 and 4 on peripheral blood neutrophils, as well as actin polymerization and migration. These data reveal an integral role for G-CSF-driven neutrophil responses in ocular autoimmunity, operating within and outside of the bone marrow, and also identify G-CSF as a potential therapeutic target in the treatment of human uveoretinitis.",11,2016-Jan-1

Behçet's disease is most prevalent in countries along the former Silk Road. Prevalence varies from 70-420 per 100,000 in Turkey, and 13.5-20 and 1-2 per 100,000 in Asia and Western Europe, respectively. Additionally, disease severity and morbidity might be correlated with ethnicity. We studied demography and morbidity in the Dutch cohort of patients with Behçet's disease and compared those with known figures.
PATIENTS AND METHODS: The prevalence of Behçet's patients in the Rotterdam area was determined by comparing the total number of patients within the ethnic population with the number of patients diagnosed with Behçet's disease. Patient files of the Erasmus University Medical Centre (Erasmus MC) were reviewed for morbidity figures and compared with existing data.
RESULTS: In total 84 Behçet's patients of Dutch, Turkish or Moroccan descent were identified in the Rotterdam area. Prevalence of Behçet's disease differed per ethnicity: 1, 71 and 39 per 100,000 for Dutch-Caucasians, Turks, and Moroccans, respectively. These figures are comparable with occurrence in West Turkey and Morocco. Within the studied Erasmus MC cohort no significant differences in morbidity appeared between the ethnic groups. However, uveitis and pustules were significantly more common in the Erasmus MC cohort as compared with UK, German, Turkish and Moroccan cohorts.
DISCUSSION AND CONCLUSIONS: We present the first epidemiological study of Behçet's disease in the Netherlands. The prevalence of Behçet's disease in the studied Dutch region and in countries of ancestry is similar. Morbidity is equally spread, compared with other countries, but uveitis and pustules seem to be more common in the Netherlands.",11,2015-Dec-1

To test interobserver agreement in the fluorescein/indocyanine green angiography (FA/ICGA) scoring system for uveitis.
METHODS: Four observers scored 32 dual FA/ICGAs. Spearman rank correlation was used to analyze correlation between pairs of observers in scores assigned to angiographic signs. Kappa statistics were used to test agreement between pairs of observers in comparative total FA and ICGA scores.
RESULTS: The authors found a significant correlation between pairs of observers in scores assigned to all FA signs and all except one ICGA sign. The only discordant sign was early stromal vessel hyperfluorescence on ICGA. There was a moderate to substantial agreement between pairs of observers in comparative FA/ICGA total scores.
CONCLUSIONS: The level of agreement between uveitis specialists in scoring of dual FA/ICGA indicates that the scoring system tested in this study will be useful for clinical studies of uveitis. Increased experience with this system may further improve its reproducibility.",11,2010-Oct-1

Noninfectious uveitis is a potentially sight-threatening ocular disorder and variable therapeutic strategies have been proposed. Biologic therapies were introduced as a new option for patients with uveitis refractory to the conventional therapy using corticosteroids and immunosuppressive agents, and 10 years have passed since the initiation. In this review, the author summarizes current articles on the assessment of therapeutic application of biologics for refractory uveitis including other autoimmune diseases. Although some results are based on investigation with insufficient clinical trials, especially in biologics, the majority of biologics indicate preferable outcomes on refractory uveitis, with remarkable promise to increase the possibility of long-term remissions.",11,2013-Jan-1

Tubulointerstitial nephritis and uveitis (TINU) syndrome is defined as the occurrence of tubulointerstitial nephritis (TIN) and uveitis in the absence of other systemic diseases. The most comprehensive review on this condition was published in 2001.
METHODS: We conducted a systematic review of the literature for cases of TINU syndrome. MEDLINE and Embase databases were screened. Full-length articles or letters reporting cases with both TIN and uveitis were selected. We investigated differences between males and females and paediatric and adult cases. Multivariate analysis was performed to identify potential risk factors for chronic kidney disease (CKD) development.
RESULTS: A total of 233 articles reporting 592 TINU cases were retained for the analysis. The median age of the included subjects was 17 years (interquartile range 13-46) with a female predominance (65%). Uveitis most frequently (52%) followed renal disease and was mostly anterior (65%) and bilateral (88%). Children tended to have more ocular relapses, while they were slightly less likely than adults to suffer from acute kidney injury and to develop CKD. Adult age as well as posterior or panuveitis were associated with an increased risk of developing CKD.
CONCLUSIONS: TINU affects both children and adults, with some differences between these two categories. Adult age and the presence of a posterior uveitis or panuveitis appear to be associated with the development of CKD.",11,2022-Apr-25

Uveitis, or inflammatory eye disease, is a common extra-articular manifestation of many systemic autoinflammatory diseases involving the joints. Anakinra (recombinant interleukin (IL)-1 receptor antagonist (Ra)) is an effective therapy in several arthritic diseases; yet, few studies have investigated the extent to which IL-1 signalling or IL-1Ra influences the onset and/or severity of uveitis.
OBJECTIVE: To seek possible links between arthritis and uveitis pathogenesis related to IL-1 signalling.
METHODS: The eyes of IL-1Ra-deficient BALB/c mice were monitored histologically and by intravital videomicroscopy to determine if uveitis developed along with the expected spontaneous arthritis in ankles and knees. Expression levels of IL-1R and its negative regulators (IL-1Ra, IL-1RII, IL-1RAcP and single Ig IL-1R-related molecule) in eye and joint tissues were compared. Differences in uveitis induced by intraocular injection of lipopolysaccharide (LPS) in mice lacking IL-1R or IL-1Ra were assessed.
RESULTS: Deficiency in IL-1Ra predisposes to spontaneous arthritis, which is exacerbated by previous systemic LPS exposure. The eye, however, does not develop inflammatory disease despite the progressive arthritis or LPS exposure. Organ-specific expression patterns for IL-1Ra and negative regulators of IL-1 activity were observed that appear to predict predisposition to inflammation in each location in IL-1Ra knockout mice. The eye is extremely sensitive to locally administered LPS, and IL-1Ra deficiency markedly exacerbates the resulting uveitis.
CONCLUSION: This study demonstrates that IL-1Ra plays an important role in suppressing local responses in eyes injected with LPS and that there is discordance between murine eyes and joints in the extent to which IL-1Ra protects against spontaneous inflammation.",11,2012-May-1

Chikungunya fever, a viral disease epidemic in some parts of the world is newly introduced in the Americas. This is of considerable international concern, with a growing incidence owing to developing urbanization, tourism, and trade. Ocular manifestations of chikungunya fever are not frequent, but of great relevance. Common manifestations include conjunctivitis, optic neuritis, iridocyclitis, episcleritis, retinitis and uveitis. Diagnostic and monitoring investigations would include optical coherence tomography, fundus fluorescein and indocyanine green angiography, visual field analysis, and electrophysiologic tests. There have been no prospective, randomized therapeutic trials, and it is unclear if the disease is self-limiting or if treatment is actually beneficial.

RESULTS: Of 1450 patients with uveitis, 115 (7.9%) had neurological disease that was considered to be causally related to the eye inflammation. The most frequent neurological associations were Vogt-Koyanagi-Harada disease, primary central nervous system lymphoma, multiple sclerosis, and herpes virus infections.
CONCLUSIONS: Neurological disease is common among patients attending a uveitis service. The distinctive characteristics of the uveal inflammation may be useful in diagnosing the neurological disease.",11,2004-Dec-1

Treatment of inflammatory diseases of the eye is especially challenging. Although physicians in antiquity had recognized the existence of ocular inflammatory disease, their lack of understanding of the immune system made successful treatment almost impossible. Throughout the 20th century, great advances in the diagnosis and treatment of uveitis led to unique treatment options. The development of corticosteroids in 1949 and its application to the eye in 1950 revolutionized therapeutic strategies. As the use of corticosteroids became more prevalent in treating ocular inflammatory diseases, so did its side effects. Due to the high morbidity in conjunction with long-term corticosteroid use, physicians pursued other agents, specifically through the employment of chemotherapeutic agents. The shift from exclusive corticosteroid monotherapy to steroid-sparing immunomodulatory therapy reshaped the landscape of treating ocular inflammatory disease. Over time, with increased efforts, new therapies were studied, trialed, and brought to the market. Today, in comparison to any other time in history, physicians have available to them the largest array of effective agents for achieving the ultimate goal: corticosteroid-free, durable remission.",11,2012-1-1

To describe the authors' approach to the management of patients with recalcitrant, chronic, endogenous uveitis using low-dose Cyclosporin A (CSA) alone or in combination with other immunosuppressive agents with attention to the anti-inflammatory efficacy, visual outcome, and side effects of therapy.
METHODS: The authors reviewed the records of 50 patients (92 eyes) with uveitis of various etiologies who had been treated with low-dose CSA (2.5-5.0 mg/kg daily) alone or in combination with prednisone and/or azathioprine (1.5-2.0 mg/kg daily). The median follow-up on low-dose CSA was 16 months (range, 6-64 months).
RESULTS: Inflammatory control was achieved in 68 (73.9%) eyes, while persistent inflammatory activity was observed in 14 (15.2%). Thirty-eight (41%) eyes improved two Snellen lines or more, 43 (47.0%) stabilized, and 11 (12.0%) lost two lines or more. The CSA was discontinued because of nephrotoxicity in three patients and in each of two with systemic hypertension and constitutional intolerance to the drug, respectively. Thirteen patients enjoy inflammatory remission with this regimen.
CONCLUSION: Low-dose CSA used alone or in combination with other immunosuppressive agents is effective in achieving inflammatory control with a favorable visual outcome and provides a useful steroid-sparing strategy in the management of chronic endogenous uveitis. The CSA-associated toxicity may be reduced by initiating therapy at very low initial doses, with incremental dosage escalation to the desired target range.",11,1996-Mar-1

Sympathetic ophthalmia (SO) is an uncommon uveitic condition that occurs after injury to the uvea of one eye and may occur after accidental ocular trauma or ocular surgery. We sought to investigate the common causes of SO in Singapore and the demographic profile as well as the final visual acuity after treatment in these patients.
METHODS: This was a retrospective, non-comparative case series in which patients with SO were identified from the Singapore National Eye Centre uveitis database in the period between 1993 and 2003. The patients' case records were examined for a history of ocular trauma or surgery and subsequent development of bilateral or contralateral uveitis consistent with SO or histopathological evidence of SO in enucleated eyes. The medical records of these patients were reviewed for details of the inciting event, presentation, treatment, and visual acuity.
RESULTS: A total of ten patients (six men and four women) were diagnosed with SO in the period of study. SO occurred after accidental trauma in three patients and following ocular surgery in seven. Vitreoretinal surgery was responsible for four of these cases, and diode laser cyclophotoablation for another two, whereas neodymium:yttrium-aluminium-garnet (Nd:YAG) laser cyclotherapy was the cause in the last patient. Overall, six of ten patients underwent at least one vitreoretinal procedure. Four of the patients had a final visual acuity of 6/15 or better, whereas five had a visual acuity of 6/30 or worse. Good final visual acuity appeared to be associated with early initiation of immunosuppressive therapy.
CONCLUSION: In this series, ocular surgery, especially vitreoretinal surgery, had overtaken non-surgical trauma as the major cause of SO. A good outcome was possible in most cases if an early diagnosis was made and immunosuppressive treatment started promptly.",11,2006-Feb-1

To compare a hydrophobic and a hydrophilic acrylic single-piece intraocular lens (IOL) in uveitis patients with respect to biocompatibility and visual outcome.
METHODS: Prospective, randomized study in patients with noninfectious uveitis after phacoemulsification and implantation of either a hydrophobic AcrySof (group 1, n = 30) or a hydrophilic Akreos adapt (group 2, n = 30), sharp-edged acrylic IOL. The primary outcome was uveal biocompatibility, detected by giant-cell deposition, anterior chamber cell count and laserflare photometry over a 6-month follow-up period. Secondary outcome measures were capsular biocompatibility, as detected by posterior capsule opacification (PCO), lens epithelial cell outgrowth and Nd:YAG capsulotomies, and visual outcome.
RESULTS: The groups did not differ with respect to anatomic type of uveitis, immunosuppressive treatment, associated systemic disease, and intraoperative manipulation. The number of giant cells on the anterior IOL surface was higher in group 1 than in group 2 (p = 0.03). The number of anterior chamber cells, laser flare photometry levels, and uveitis reactivations after surgery did not differ between the groups. After 6 months, the number of patients with PCO development (p = 1.0) and Nd:YAG capsulotomies (p = 0.21), lens epithelial cell outgrowth, visual outcome and uveitis complications were comparable in both groups.
CONCLUSIONS: Both of the acrylic IOLs used had good uveal and capsular biocompatibility, leading to significant improvement in BCVA in patients with noninfectious uveitis. No obvious differences were detected at 6 months with respect to uveal and capsular biocompatibility and visual outcome.",11,2008-Nov-1

We studied the case records of 1122 patients with endogenous uveitis including 418 new cases treated at the University Eye Clinic in Turku during the years 1980-1982 and 1988. The mean annual incidence and prevalence rates of anterior uveitis were, respectively, 21.3 and 68.7 per 100,000, of posterior uveitis 0.8 and 4.6 per 100,000, of panuveitis 0.2 and 0.8 per 100 000, and of all uveitis cases 22.6 and 75.4 per 100,000 population. The incidence of uveitis was higher in the age group 20-69 years than in the age groups 0-19 years (p < 0.001) and 70 years or over (p = 0.049). The incidence rates were not different between sexes in any age group (p = 0.2). The incidence of uveitis was higher in lower socio-economic groups than in higher socio-economic groups (p < 0.001). There were no significant differences in the incidence of uveitis between sexes in different socio-economic groups (p = 0.1).",10,1995-Aug-1

In a small case series of patients with uveitis-associated ocular hypertension (OHTN) or glaucoma, goniotomy with Kahook Dual Blade (KDB) was an effective surgical treatment option for lowering intraocular pressure (IOP).
PURPOSE: The purpose of this study is to review the success of goniotomy using the KDB with trabecular meshwork (TM) excision in lowering the IOP of patients with uveitis-associated OHTN or glaucoma.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: A retrospective chart review was completed for all patients with uveitis-associated OHTN or glaucoma who underwent KDB goniotomy with TM excision alone or in combination with phacoemulsification cataract surgery at a single institution. The study included 12 patients (16 eyes). Patients were followed for a minimum of 5 months postoperatively. The main outcome measures of this case series included postoperative IOPs, percent IOP reduction, and reduction of glaucoma medications.
RESULTS: The mean maximum IOP of the patients before maximum-tolerated medical therapy or surgery was 35.6±5.8 mm Hg. The mean preoperative IOP at the clinical office visit before surgery of these patients was 28.1±8.5 mm Hg on maximum-tolerated medical therapy. Ten eyes (62.5%) have maintained an IOP at or below their goal through their most recent follow-up visit (mean follow-up time of 9.6±5.6 mo). The mean number of glaucoma medications was significantly reduced from 3.6±0.9 medications to 2.1±1.7 medications, for a mean reduction of 1.5±1.4 medications (P=0.004).
CONCLUSIONS: On the basis of this small case series, KDB goniotomy may be a safe, less invasive, and effective first-line surgical alternative for patients with uveitis-associated OHTN or glaucoma refractory to medical therapy.",10,2019-Aug-1

The authors analyzed the incidence of cataract development and the visual outcome of cataract surgery performed on patients with sarcoidosis-associated uveitis who were treated at the Immunology Service at the Massachusetts Eye and Ear Infirmary during a 17-year period.
METHODS: The records of 102 patients with sarcoidosis-associated uveitis who were treated with topical and regional corticosteroids, systemic nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs, systemic steroids, or with systemic immunosuppressive chemotherapy were reviewed. Cataract surgery was performed on those eyes in which cataract developed, resulting in decreased visual acuity of 20/100 or less. The incidence of cataract development and visual results of cataract extraction and intraocular lens implantation were analyzed.
RESULTS: In this cohort of 102 patients, visually significant cataracts that warranted surgery developed in 10 (16 eyes). In addition, four patients (5 eyes) had a visually significant cataract at the time of first evaluation. A total of 14 patients (21 eyes) underwent cataract surgery. Posterior chamber lens implantation accompanied cataract surgery in 19 (90.5%) of 21 eyes. The average final visual acuity of the 21 eyes after cataract surgery was 20/51, and 61% of the eyes achieved a stable visual acuity of 20/40 or better. The major causes of the decreased visual acuity in patients who had less than 20/40 visual acuity were sequelae of chronic posterior uveitis, cystoid macular edema, epiretinal membrane, and glaucomatous optic nerve damage.
CONCLUSION: Posterior chamber lens implantation and cataract surgery in patients with sarcoidosis-associated uveitis can be well tolerated when absolute control of the inflammation is achieved. Pre-existing retinal pathology and glaucoma as a result of uncontrolled inflammation resulting in permanent ocular structural damage were found to be the most important factors for determining the postoperative final visual acuity.",10,1994-Mar-1

We determined the incidence of immune complex increases, the nature of immune complexes, and the correlation between the immune complex level and clinical uveitis status in patients with chronic iridocyclitis and chronic diffuse uveitis. Ten of 16 patients with chronic iridocyclitis had increased levels of immune complexes, and this correlated with disease activity. Immune complexes were detected in ten of 12 patients with chronic diffuse uveitis. These complexes have a molecular weight of approximately 2 X 10(6) daltons. The antibody component of immune complex is IgG; however; the antigenic component of the immune complexes is unclear.",10,1979-May-1

Experimental autoimmune uveitis (EAU) and experimental autoimmune pinealitis (EAP) are CD4+ T cell-mediated inflammatory diseases of the uveal tract and retina of the eye and of the pineal gland. EAU and EAP can be induced by several retinal autoantigens including S-antigen (S-Ag) and interphotoreceptor retinoid binding protein (IRBP). In this study we investigated the effect of intravenous administration of S-Ag and IRBP coupled to syngeneic spleen cells on the development of EAU and EAP. Injection of S-Ag or IRBP coupled to spleen cells 5 days prior to immunization with native S-Ag or IRBP, respectively, was effective in preventing the induction of EAU and EAP in LEW rats. Conversely, LEW rats receiving S-Ag-coupled spleen cells and challenged with IRBP or LEW rats receiving IRBP-coupled spleen cells and challenged with S-Ag developed a severe EAU within 10 days to 2 weeks following immunization, as did all control animals receiving sham-coupled spleen cells and challenged with the two retinal antigens. The results show that the administration of retinal autoantigens coupled to spleen cells effectively protects against the development of EAU when animals are subsequently challenged with the tolerizing antigen but not when challenged with another unrelated pathogenic retinal autoantigen.",10,1992-Feb-1

To evaluate the long-term outcomes of uveitic macular edema (ME).
DESIGN: Longitudinal follow-up of a cohort of participants in a randomized clinical trial.
PARTICIPANTS: A total of 248 eyes of 177 participants with uveitic ME enrolled in the Multicenter Uveitis Steroid Treatment (MUST) Trial and Follow-up Study.
METHODS: OCT measurements, taken at baseline and annually, were graded by reading center graders masked to clinical data. Macular edema was defined as a center macular thickness (CMT) ≥240 μm on time-domain OCT or time-domain OCT equivalent. Resolution of ME was defined as normalization of macular thickness on OCT. Relapse of ME was defined as increase in macular thickness to ≥240 μm in an eye that previously had resolution. Visual acuity was measured at each visit with logarithmic visual acuity charts.
MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Resolution and relapse of ME. Visual acuity.
RESULTS: Among 227 eyes with ME followed ≥1 year, the cumulative percent of eyes with ME resolving at any point during 7 years was 94% (95% confidence interval [CI], 89-97). Epiretinal membranes on OCT were associated with a lower likelihood of ME resolution (hazard ratio [HR], 0.74; 95% CI, 0.55-1.01; P = 0.05). Among 177 eyes with resolved ME, the cumulative percent with relapse within 7 years was 43% (95% CI, 32-51). Eyes in which ME resolved gained a mean of 6.24 letters (95% CI, 4.40-8.09; P < 0.001) compared with eyes that remained free from ME during the 1-year follow-up intervals, whereas eyes in which ME did not resolve experienced no gain in vision (mean change -1.30 letters; 95% CI, -2.70 to 0.09; P = 0.065), and eyes that developed ME during the year (incident or relapsed) experienced a mean loss of -8.65 letters (95% CI, -11.5 to -5.84, P < 0.001).
CONCLUSIONS: Given sufficient time and treatment, nearly all uveitic ME resolves, but episodes of relapse were common. Visual acuity results were better among eyes with resolved ME, suggesting that control of inflammation and resolution of ME might be visually relevant treatment targets.",10,2021-May-1

We developed a novel scoring system for uveitis due to Behçet's disease (BD), termed Behçet's disease ocular attack score 24 (BOS24), and examined its validity and usefulness by estimating changes in ocular disease activities both before and after initiation of infliximab therapy.
METHODS: BOS24 consists of a total 24 points divided into 6 parameters of ocular inflammatory symptoms. To examine the validity of our scoring system, 5 uveitis specialists examined the severity of 50 ocular attacks in clinical charts using both our system and a physician's impression score (grade 1-10). In addition, ocular disease activities both before and after initiation of infliximab were retrospectively examined in 150 cases of ocular BD using BOS24.
RESULTS: The average BOS24 for the 5 doctors was highly correlated with the average physician's impression score (p < 0.0001), whereas the coefficient of variance for BOS24 among doctors was much lower than that for the physician's impression score (p < 0.0001). Summation of BOS24 over a 6-month period (BOS24-6M) was significantly reduced after starting infliximab therapy (p < 0.0001). The average BOS24 for individual ocular attacks was also significantly decreased after starting infliximab, with scores for the posterior pole and fovea notably improved.
CONCLUSIONS: BOS24 was highly related to severity noted by the physician's impression and had a low level of variability among the examined doctors. Using our novel scoring system, infliximab therapy was shown to reduce not only the frequency of ocular attacks, but also the severity of each attack. BOS24 is a promising tool for evaluating ocular BD activities.",10,2014-Mar-1

Ocular lesions of Behcet's disease (BD) need aggressive treatment to prevent severe loss of vision or blindness. Cytotoxic drugs are the main therapeutic agents and the first line treatment. Retinal vasculitis is the most aggressive lesion of ocular manifestations and predicts a worse systemic outcome. We present here the outcome with a combination of pulse cyclophosphamide, azathioprine and prednisolone, on long-term usage, up to 10 years, on 295 patients (18 493 eye-months of follow-up).
METHODS: Cyclophosphamide was used as a 1-g monthly pulse for 6 months and then every 2-3 months as necessary. Azathioprine was used at 2-3 mg/kg daily. Prednisolone was initiated at 0.5 mg/kg daily. Upon the suppression of the inflammatory reaction, prednisolone was tapered gradually. Patients fulfilled the International Criteria Behcet's Disease (ICBD) and had active posterior uveitis (PU) and/or retinal vasculitis (RV). Visual acuity (VA), PU, RV and TADAI (Total Adjusted Disease Activity Index) were calculated.
RESULTS: Overall results: mean VA improved from 3.5 to 4.3 (P < 0.0001), 44% of eyes improved (95% CI = 40-50). Mean PU improved from 2.1 to 0.8 (P < 0.0001), 73% of eyes improved (95% CI = 69-78). Mean RV improved from 3.0 to 1.4 P < 0.0001), 70% of eyes improved (95% CI = 65-74). Mean TADAI improved from 29 to 18 (P < 0.0001), 72% of patients improved (95% CI = 66-77). The details of the longitudinal studies are given in the main article.
CONCLUSION: All parameters significantly improved. VA improvement was the least, mainly due to cataracts. This combination is the best treatment choice for retinal vasculitis before opting for biologic agents.",10,2014-May-1

Glatiramer acetate (GA), a synthetic random amino acid copolymer, poly(Y, E, A, K)n, is widely used for treatment of multiple sclerosis. It inhibits experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis (EAE) in mice by competition with the antigen and by induction of regulatory T cells. A novel copolymer, poly (F, Y, A, K)n , designated FYAK, was more effective than GA in its immunomodulatory activity in EAE. Here, FYAK and GA were compared in the amelioration of another disease model in mice, experimental autoimmune uveoretinitis (EAU). When tested by co-immunization with an uveitogenic antigen, FYAK was superior to GA in its capacity to inhibit EAU induction, as well as immune processes related to this condition. Further, regulatory T-cell lines specific to FYAK were more immunosuppressive than GA-specific lines in the EAU model. The superiority of FYAK-specific lines was accompanied by higher production of Th2 cytokines. These data thus demonstrate that FYAK, a novel copolymer, is superior to GA in its capacity to inhibit immunopathogenic processes in a non-central nervous system tissue.",10,2009-Oct-30

To evaluate local and systemic safety of suprachoroidal (SC) triamcinolone acetonide injectable suspension (CLS-TA) injections in subjects with non-infectious uveitis (NIU).
DESIGN: Open-label, prospective multicentre safety study.
PARTICIPANTS: Thirty-eight subjects with NIU, with and without macular oedema (MO).
METHODS: Treatment consisted of two suprachoroidal injections of CLS-TA 4 mg, 12 weeks apart. Best-corrected visual acuity (BCVA), adverse event (AE) assessment, ophthalmic examinations and optical coherence tomography (OCT) were conducted every 4 weeks for 24 weeks. Blood samples were analysed for plasma triamcinolone acetonide (TA) concentrations.
MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: The main outcome measure was frequency of AEs. Other endpoints included plasma TA concentrations, change in signs of inflammation, BCVA and retinal central subfield thickness (CST).
RESULTS: Based on a CST of >300 µm, 20 out of 38 subjects had MO at baseline. Mean intraocular pressure (IOP) was 13.3 mm Hg at baseline and 15.2 mm Hg at week 24 in the study eye. A total of six (15.8%) subjects had an IOP rise >10 mm Hg compared with baseline, in the study eye, and two (5.3%) subjects had IOP >30 mm Hg (maximum 34 mm Hg at week 8 and 38 mm Hg at week 20). Cataract formation AEs were reported in four study eyes; one of which was deemed treatment-related. No serious ocular AEs in the study eye occurred in the study. Quantifiable post-injection TA plasma concentration was <1 ng/mL. Efficacy parameters showed improvement over the 24-week study period.
CONCLUSIONS: Suprachoroidally administered CLS-TA was safe and well tolerated over the 24-week, open-label study in NIU subjects with and without MO.",10,2022-Jun-1

Acute anterior uveitis is an important ocular disease of considerable interest to therapeutically and non-therapeutically qualified optometrists. This review examines the role of optometrists in the primary care setting and gives guidelines for appropriate care of patients with anterior uveitis. Diagnosis and differentiation from other forms of anterior segment inflammation are the initial requirement. In parallel, possible medical conditions associated with acute anterior uveitis must be considered, with appropriate referral to medical practitioners. In uncomplicated cases of recurrent acute anterior uveitis, optometrists can initiate topical treatment and monitor resolution of inflammation, while being aware of possible complications of both the disease and its treatment. It is especially important in new attacks of anterior uveitis to liaise with the patient's general practitioner about medical investigation for underlying disease. Atypical, complicated or severe anterior uveitis should be promptly referred for specialist care.",10,2007-Mar-1

Significant advances in the diagnosis and therapy for uveitis have been made to improve the quality of care for patients with ocular inflammatory diseases. While traditional ophthalmic examination techniques, fluorescein angiography, and optical coherence tomography continue to play a major role in the evaluation of patients with uveitis, the advent of spectral domain optical coherence tomography and fundus autofluorescence into clinical practice provides additional information about disease processes. Polymerase chain reaction and cytokine diagnostics have also continued to play a greater role in the evaluation of patients with inflammatory diseases. The biologic agents, a group of medications that targets cytokines and other soluble mediators of inflammation, have demonstrated promise in targeted immunotherapy for specific uveitic entities. Their ophthalmic indications have continued to expand, improving the therapeutic armentarium of uveitis specialists.",10,2008-Apr-1

Fluoroquinolones are the most commonly prescribed antibiotic class in the outpatient setting. Recent reports have implicated an association between oral fluoroquinolones and an increased risk of uveitis.
OBJECTIVE: To determine the hazard of uveitis with oral fluoroquinolone use.
DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: A retrospective cohort study was conducted using medical claims data from a large national US insurer (N = 4,387,651). Cohorts from ambulatory care centers across the United States were created including every new user of an oral fluoroquinolone or β-lactam antibiotic prescription with at least 24 months of data prior to the date of the prescription from January 1, 2000, to January 30, 2013. Exclusion criteria consisted of any previous diagnosis of uveitis or a uveitis-associated systemic illness. Participants were censored for a new diagnosis of a uveitis-associated systemic illness, the end of an observation period, use of the other class of antibiotic, or removal from the insurance plan. Data analysis was performed from January 2 through March 15, 2015.
MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: The hazard of a uveitis diagnosis after a fluoroquinolone prescription compared with a β-lactam prescription using multivariate regression with Cox proportional hazards models.
RESULTS: Of the 4,387,651 patients in the database, 843,854 individuals receiving a fluoroquinolone and 3,543,797 patients receiving a β-lactam were included in the analysis. After controlling for age, race, and sex using multivariate analysis, no hazard for developing uveitis at the 30-, 60-, or 90-day observation windows was seen (hazard ratio [HR] range, 0.96; 95% CI, 0.82-1.13; to 1.05; 95% CI, 0.95-1.16; P > .38 for all comparisons). The 365-day observation period showed a small increase in the HR for the fluoroquinolone cohort (1.11; 95% CI, 1.05-1.17; P < .001). Moxifloxacin produced an increased hazard for uveitis at every time point (HR range, 1.47-1.75; 95% CI, 1.27-2.37; P < .001 for all comparisons). Secondary analysis demonstrated a similar hazard at 365 days for a later diagnosis of a uveitis-associated systemic illness after fluoroquinolone use (HR range, 1.46-1.96; 95% CI, 1.42-2.07; P < .001 for all comparisons).
CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: These data do not support an association between oral fluoroquinolone use and uveitis. Instead, this study shows an association between oral fluoroquinolone use and the risk for uveitis-associated systemic illnesses, which is a possible source of bias that could explain the findings of previous studies.",10,2016-Jan-1

Uveitis is a complex ocular inflammatory disease often accompanied by bacterial or viral infections (infectious uveitis) or underlying autoimmune diseases (non-infectious uveitis). Treatment of the underlying infection along with corticosteroid-mediated suppression of acute inflammation usually resolves infectious uveitis. However, to develop more effective therapies for non-infectious uveitis and to better address acute inflammation in infectious disease, an improved understanding of the underlying inflammatory pathways is needed. In this review, we discuss the disease aetiology, preclinical in vitro and in vivo uveitis models, the role of inflammatory pathways, as well as current and future therapies. In particular, we highlight the involvement of the inflammasome in the development of non-infectious uveitis and how it could be a future target for effective treatment of the disease.",10,2021-Dec-1

A retrospective study was conducted to assess the causes of blindness and visual impairment in patients who visited an eye hospital in Sierra Leone, West Africa, in 1989 and 1992. These data were compared with figures from 1981. Throughout the years, senile cataract was the major cause of blindness, followed by uveitis (including onchocerciasis). Uveitis remained the second most important cause of blindness in this population, despite the significant decrease in blindness from onchocerciasis (from 30% in 1981 to 15% in 1992). An increasing number of patients with uveitis from non-onchocercal origin was observed: almost 10% of the blindness found in 1992 was due to uveitis of non-onchocercal origin. A reduction in visual handicap in patients with non-onchocercal uveitis could be achieved if local hospitals could obtain more accurate diagnoses in these patients.",10,1994-Sep-1

Ocular tuberculosis (OTB) encompasses all forms of intra- and extra-ocular inflammation associated with Mycobacterium tuberculosis (Mtb) infection. However, the organism is rarely found in ocular fluid samples of diseased eyes, rendering the pathomechanisms of the disease unclear. This confounds clinical decision-making in diagnosis and treatment of OTB. Here, we critically review existing human and animal data related to ocular inflammation and TB pathogenesis to unravel likely pathomechanisms of OTB. Broadly there appear to be two fundamental mechanisms that may underlie the development of TB-associated ocular inflammation: a. inflammatory response to live/replicating Mtb in the eye, and b. immune mediated ocular inflammation induced by non-viable Mtb or its components in the eye. This distinction is significant as in direct Mtb-driven mechanisms, diagnosis and treatment would be aimed at detection of Mtb-infection and its elimination; while indirect mechanisms would primarily require anti-inflammatory therapy with adjunctive anti-TB therapy. Further, we discuss how that most clinical phenotypes of OTB likely represent a combination of both mechanisms, with one being predominant than the other.",10,2020-Sep-1

The uveitis that is associated with juvenile idiopathic arthritis (JIA) has typically been described as nongranulomatous. This study reports the prevalence of granulomatous disease in a population with JIA-associated uveitis.
METHODS: We conducted a retrospective analysis of all patients with JIA-associated uveitis seen between 1973 and 2006 at a hospital-based uveitis service. Patients with uveitis were included if they were diagnosed with JIA by a specialist and experienced at least 6 weeks of arthritis starting before the age of 16 years. Granulomatous disease was defined as Busacca or angle nodules, mutton-fat keratic precipitates (KP), or hyalinized ""ghost"" KPs. Statistical tests were performed to seek associations between granulomatous disease and various clinical factors.
RESULTS: Seventy-one patients with JIA-associated uveitis were included. Granulomatous uveitis was observed in 28% of the population, with 7% exhibiting mutton-fat KP, and 21% ""ghost"" KP. There was no association between the presence of granulomatous disease and age of arthritis onset, age of uveitis onset, sex, antinuclear antibody status, or whether the arthritis was pauciarticular or polyarticular. In this population, 67% of black patients had granulomatous disease compared with 25% of nonblack patients (p < 0.05), and 24% of white patients showed granulomatous disease compared with 56% of nonwhite patients (p = 0.11).
CONCLUSIONS: Granulomatous disease is more common in JIA-associated uveitis than previously thought and may be more common in black patients. Although it is necessary to exclude other forms of granulomatous uveitis, such as sarcoidosis, the presence of granulomatous uveitis is not inconsistent with a diagnosis of JIA-associated uveitis.",10,2008-Dec-1

Uveitis can lead to impaired vision and is responsible for 10% of all cases of blindness globally. Using an endotoxin-induced uveitis (EIU) rodent model, our previous data implicated the endogenous cannabinoid system (ECS) in the amelioration of many of the components of the inflammatory response.

Blood-retinal barrier (BRB) breakdown and retinal edema are major complications of autoimmune uveitis and could be related to deregulation of aquaporin (AQP) expression. We have therefore evaluated the expression of AQP1 and AQP4 on BRB cells during experimental autoimmune uveitis (EAU) in mice.
METHODS: C57Bl6 mice were immunized with interphotoreceptor retinoid-binding protein (IRBP) peptide 1-16. The disease was graded clinically, and double immunolabeling using glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP; a marker of disease activity) and AQP1 or AQP4 antibodies was performed at day 28. AQP1 expression was also investigated in mouse retinal pigment epithelium (RPE) cells (B6-RPE07 cell line) by reverse transcriptase PCR and western blot under basal and tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNF-alpha)-stimulated conditions.
RESULTS: In both normal and EAU retina, AQP1 and AQP4 expression were restricted to the photoreceptor layer and to the Müller cells, respectively. Retinal endothelial cells never expressed AQP1. In vasculitis and intraretinal inflammatory infiltrates, decreased AQP1 expression was observed due to the loss of photoreceptors and the characteristic radial labeling of AQP4 was lost. On the other hand, no AQP4 expression was detected in RPE cells. AQP1 was strongly expressed by choroidal endothelial cells, rendering difficult the evaluation of AQP1 expression by RPE cells in vivo. No major differences were found between EAU and controls at this level. Interestingly, B6-RPE07 cells expressed AQP1 in vitro, and TNF-alpha downregulated AQP1 protein expression in those cells.
CONCLUSIONS: Changes in retinal expression of AQP1 and AQP4 during EAU were primarily due to inflammatory lesions, contrasting with major modulation of AQP expression in BRB detected in other models of BRB breakdown. However, our data showed that TNF-alpha treatment strongly modulates AQP1 expression in B6-RPE07 cells in vitro.",10,2010-Apr-03

Albino rats and mice are sensitive to light and the recommended illumination of animal rooms (75-125 ft-candles) is known to cause retinal damage. When a room is illuminated by ceiling lights, animals in the cages of the top row and, to some extent, in the side columns of cage racks will be exposed to higher light intensity than those in the other cages of the rack. In 2-yr chemical carcinogenicity studies of the National Toxicology Program (previously the Carcinogenicity Bioassay Program of the National Cancer Institute), Fischer 344 rats were group-housed in hanging drawer-type clear polycarbonate cages. During the course of the chronic studies, a number of rats developed opacity of the eye. Ocular examination indicated chronic uveitis, deep interstitial keratitis, cataract formation leading to panophthalmitis, and in severe cases, phthisis bulbi. Histologic examination showed cataract and retinal degeneration. Incidences of these lesions were highest (greater than 55%) in the rats of the top rows and lowest in those of the bottom rows (less than 10%) of cages with no relation to chemical treatment, indicating an association with light intensity. The incidence of these eye lesions was markedly decreased (less than 15%) by decreasing the light intensity of the animal room to less than 50 ft-candles at 5 ft from the floor and rotating the cages in each column of a rack from top to bottom when cages or racks were changed.",10,1991-1-1

To determine longer-term outcomes of participants enrolled from a single center in the SYCAMORE trial, a randomized placebo-controlled trial of adalimumab vs placebo in children with juvenile idiopathic arthritis-associated uveitis (JIA-U) uncontrolled on methotrexate.
DESIGN: Retrospective interventional case series.
METHODS: Medical records of all 28 SYCAMORE participants recruited at the Bristol Eye Hospital were reviewed at approximately 3-monthly intervals up to 5 years from the trial randomization date. Uveitis activity, treatment course, visual outcomes, ocular complications, and adverse events were recorded. Data are presented using summary statistics.
RESULTS: Following withdrawal of the investigational medicinal product (IMP), 25 of the 28 participants were started on adalimumab for active JIA-U. Of the 12 participants in the active treatment arm of the SYCAMORE study, 11 (92%) were restarted on adalimumab after withdrawal of the IMP for active JIA-U (median time to flare 188 days [range 42-413 days). Two participants stopped adalimumab for uncontrolled JIA-U. One participant had a reduction in vision to 0.3 owing to cataract. Mean visual acuity for the remaining 27 participants was -0.04 (right eye) and -0.05 (left eye).
CONCLUSIONS: Drug-induced remission of JIA-U did not persist when adalimumab was withdrawn after 1-2 years of treatment. Adalimumab was well tolerated and visual acuity outcomes were excellent.",10,2019-Nov-1

RECENT FINDINGS: Recent studies have shown that ocular manifestations occur in approximately 4.4% of cat scratch disease patients. The annual prevalence is lower than previously reported to be approximately 12 500 cases annually. Mainstay treatment continues to be oral antibiotics with and without corticosteroids and is dependent on associated systemic manifestations, age, and patient immune status. More recently anti-VEGF agents have been used for complications such as cystoid macular edema and choroidal neovascularization.

To assess the efficacy of other biologic therapies, different from infliximab (IFX) and adalimumab (ADA), in patients with Behçet's disease uveitis (BU).
METHODS: Multicenter study of 124 patients with BU refractory to at least one standard immunosuppressive agent that required IFX or ADA therapy. Patients who had to be switched to another biologic agent due to inefficacy or intolerance to IFX or ADA or patient's decision were assessed. The main outcome measures were the degree of anterior and posterior chamber inflammation and macular thickness.
RESULTS: Seven (5.6%) of 124 cases (4 women/3 men; mean age, 43 (range 28- 67) years; 12 affected eyes) were studied. Five of them had been initially treated with ADA and 2 with IFX. The other biologic agents used were golimumab (n=4), tocilizumab (n=2) and rituximab (n=1). The ocular pattern was panuveitis (n=4) or posterior uveitis (n=3). Uveitis was bilateral in 5 patients (71.4%). At baseline, anterior chamber and vitreous inflammation were present in 6 (50%) and 7 (58.3%) of the eyes. All the patients (12 eyes) had macular thickening (OCT>250μm) and 4 of them (7 eyes), cystoid macular edema (OCT>300 μm). Besides reduction anterior chamber and vitreous inflammation, we observed a reduction of OCT values, from 330.4±58.5 μm at the onset of the biological agent to 273±50 μm at month 12 (p=0.06). Six patients achieved a complete remission of uveitis.
CONCLUSIONS: The vast majority of patients with BU refractory to standard immunosuppressive drugs are successfully controlled with ADA and/or IFX. Other biologic agents appear to be also useful.",10,2016-1-1

The purpose of the study was to identify the clinical and etiological profile of uveitis at the apex institute for eye care in India. This is a prospective, prevalence study. 980 consecutive patients with uveitis referred to uvea clinic, Dr. RP Centre for Ophthalmic Sciences (Ophthalmology division, All India Institute of Medical Sciences). Demographic data of each patient were noted and a thorough ocular examination including slit lamp examination and dilated fundus evaluation was carried out. OCT and fluorescein angiography were undertaken whenever indicated. Uveitis was classified based on the anatomic location of inflammation (IUSG classification). Relevant serological and radiological investigations were obtained based on systemic symptomatology, and if the uveitis was recurrent (even in the absence of systemic symptoms). The presence of a systemic disease was confirmed by obtaining an internist consultation. The main outcome measures include pattern of uveitis according to anatomical classification and the etiology. Out of 980 patients with uveitis, 413 (42.14 %) patients had anterior uveitis, 131 (13.36 %) had intermediate uveitis, 165 (16.83 %) had posterior uveitis, 91 (9.2 %) had panuveitis, 47 (4.7 %) had retinal vasculitis, 22 (2.24 %) had scleritis, 17 (1.7 %) had masquerade syndromes, 8 (0.8 %) had keratouveitis, 22 (2.24 %) had sclerokeratouveitis, 19 (1.9 %) had endophthalmitis and 45 (4.5 %) had other causes of inflammation including trauma and intraocular surgery. Out of all uveitic patients definite etiological correlation could be made out in 225 (23 %) patients; thus 77 % were categorised as idiopathic. Only 9 % of all patients were found to have uveitis with an infectious etiology. Amongst infectious causes of uveitis tuberculosis was the leading cause, accounting for sixty percent of all infectious uveitis (approximately 5 % of overall uveitis). Non-infectious uveitis etiology accounted for more than 90 % of all cases with ankylosing spondylitis being the most common followed by sarcoidosis and juvenile rheumatoid arthritis. Amongst known uveitic syndromes serpiginous like choroidopathy was the most common and was followed by acute posterior placoid pigmented epitheliopathy and Fuch's heterochromic iridocyclitis. Infection, including tuberculosis, is an infrequent cause of uveitis in the study population. Multicentric, collaborative efforts are required to improve levels of clinical evidence and evolve consensus in establishing stringent guidelines for labelling uveitis as being of infectious etiology.",10,2016-Jun-1

Quantitative methods for posterior uveitis are necessary for precise appraisal and follow-up of inflammation in practice and in clinical trials. The aim of this study was to assess fluorescein angiography (FA), indocanine green angiography (ICGA), and enhanced depth imaging optical coherence tomography choroidal thickness (EDI-OCT CT) in two stromal choroiditis entities, birdshot retinochoroiditis (BRC), and Vogt-Koyanagi-Harada disease (VKH), as well as to determine (1) disease patterns, (2) respective response to therapy, and (3) their potential utility in clinical trials in comparison to vitreous haze, the present standard outcome used in clinical trials.
METHODS: This retrospective study included newly diagnosed patients with BRC and VKH, seen at the Centre for Ophthalmic Specialized Care, Lausanne, Switzerland. Angiographic signs were quantified using an established dual FA/ICGA scoring system for uveitis at presentation and on follow-up. FA/ICGA score ratios were compared between diseases to determine disease patterns. EDI-OCT CT was determined using a spectral domain instrument. Vitreous haze was determined using the SUN (Standardization of Uveitis Nomenclature) method.
RESULTS: Among 1872 uveitis patients seen from 1995 to 2016, 8 newly diagnosed BRC patients (16 eyes) and 6 newly diagnosed VKH patients (12 eyes) had sufficient data for study inclusion. Patients with BRC and VKH at initial onset had mean FA scores of 16.1 ± 7.0 vs. 4.6 ± 2.1 (p < 0.0001), respectively, while mean ICGA scores were similarly high in the two diseases, 18.9 ± 3.6 (BRC) vs. 20.8 ± 7.5 (VKH). After therapy, FA and ICGA scores decreased significantly for both entities (- 60% of FA score and 55% of ICGA score in BRC vs. - 72% of FA score and - 87% for ICGA score in VKH). EDI-OCT CT decreased significantly in the two entities. Vitreous haze was almost absent in VKH and low in BRC.
CONCLUSION: Dual FA/ICGA scoring showed the diverse disease patterns of BRC and VKH; both the retina and choroid were involved at onset in BRC, whereas VKH was a pure choroidal disease with later spillover into the retina. Dual FA/ICGA allowed for the precise measurement of inflammation at onset and upon follow-up. EDI-OCT CT responded to therapy in both diseases but was found to be of limited use in this early/subacute disease phase because it lacked sensitivity to detect subclinical recurrences and was therefore only useful for long-term follow-up. Vitreous haze was low in both entities and thus useless as an inflammatory parameter.",10,2018-Apr-1

Autoimmune uveitis is an intraocular inflammation that arises through autoreactive T-cells attacking the inner eye, eventually leading to blindness. However, the contributing molecular pathomechanisms within the affected tissues remain as yet elusive. The extracellular matrix (ECM) is a highly dynamic structure that varies tremendously and influences the encompassing tissue. In order to assess ECM re-modeling in autoimmune uveitis, we investigated the expression of ECM molecules fibronectin and osteopontin in vitreous and retina samples. This was carried out in the only spontaneous animal model for human autoimmue uveitis, namely equine recurrent uveitis (ERU) that resembles the human disease in clinical as well as in immunopathological aspects. ERU is a naturally occurring autoimmune disease in horses that develops frequently and has already proved its value to study disease-related pathomechanisms. Western blot analysis of fibronectin and osteopontin in healthy and uveitic vitreous revealed significant reduction of both proteins in uveitis. Immunohistochemical expression of fibronectin in healthy retinas was restricted to the inner limiting membrane abutting vimentin positive Müller cell endfeet, while in uveitic sections, a disintegration of the ILM was observed changing the fibronectin expression to a dispersed pattern extending toward the vitreous. Retinal expression of osteopontin in control tissue was found in a characteristic Müller cell pattern illustrated by co-localization with vimentin. In uveitic retinas, the immunoreactivity of osteopontin in gliotic Müller cells was almost absent. The ability of Müller cells to express fibronectin and osteopontin was additionally shown by immunocytochemistry of primary cultured equine Müller cells and the equine Müller cell line eqMC-7. In conclusion, severe ECM re-modeling in autoimmune uveitis reported here, might affect the adhesive function of fibronectin and thus the anchoring of Müller cell endfeet to the ILM. Furthermore, the absence of osteopontin in gliotic Müller cells might represent reduced neuroprotection, an osteopontin attribute that is intensively discussed.",10,2011-1-1

Immune-mediated inflammatory diseases (IMIDs) are chronic autoimmune conditions that share common pathophysiologic mechanisms. The optimal management of patients with IMIDs remains challenging because the coexistence of different conditions requires the intervention of several specialists. The aim of this study was to develop a series of statements defining overarching principles that guide the implementation of a multidisciplinary approach for the management of spondyloarthritis (SpA)-related IMIDs including SpA, psoriasis, psoriatic arthritis, Crohn's disease, ulcerative colitis and uveitis.
METHODS: A Delphi consensus-based approach was used to identify a core set of statements. The process included development of initial questions by a steering committee, an exhaustive search of the literature using complementary approaches to identify potential statements and two Delphi voting rounds for finalization of the statements.
RESULTS: Consensus was achieved on the related nature of IMIDs, the existence of a high prevalence of multiple IMIDs in a single patient and the fact that a multidisciplinary approach can result in a more extensive evaluation and comprehensive approach to treatment. The goals of a multidisciplinary team should be to increase diagnosis of concomitant IMIDs, improve the decision-making process, and increase patient satisfaction and adherence. Early referral and diagnosis, early recognition of concomitant IMIDs and optimizing treatment to improve patient quality of life are some of the advantages of using multidisciplinary teams. To be effective, a multidisciplinary team should be equipped with the appropriate tools for diagnosis and follow-up, and at a minimum the multidisciplinary team should include a dermatologist, gastroenterologist and rheumatologist; providing psychologic support via a psychologist and involving an ophthalmologist, general practitioners and nurses in multidisciplinary care is also important.
CONCLUSION: The present Delphi consensus identified a set of overarching principles that may be useful for implementation of a multidisciplinary approach for the management of SpA-related IMIDs.

To report our experience using Ozurdex (Allergan, Irvine, CA), a biodegradable intravitreal implant containing of 0.7 mg of dexamethasone approved for use in adults with noninfectious uveitis in adults, in the treatment of pediatric uveitis.
METHODS: The medical records of consecutive patients with noninfectious posterior uveitis who were unresponsive to standard treatment and subsequently received the Ozurdex implant from March 2011 to March 2013 were retrospectively reviewed.
RESULTS: A total of 14 eyes of 11 patients (mean age, 10.1 years; range 4-12) received 22 Ozurdex implants during the study period. Of the 11 patients, 7 had idiopathic intermediate or posterior uveitis, 1 had sympathetic ophthalmia, 2 had juvenile idiopathic arthritis, and 1 had sarcoidosis. All patients were uncontrolled with standard treatment, including topical or sub-Tenon's or systemic corticosteriods and/or immune-modulation. Visual acuity improved after Ozurdex implant in 5 of 8 patients (63%). Intraocular inflammation was controlled or improved after 17 of 22 of implants (12 eyes [77%]). The frequency of topical corticosteroids was decreased and/or discontinued after 18 of 22 implants (12 eyes [82%]). Complications included implant migration into the anterior chamber (4 aphakic eyes), increased intraocular pressure (5 eyes), and progression of a preexisting cataract (1 eye). The uveitis reoccurred in 57% of eyes at 4.3 months (2-7 months) after injection.
CONCLUSIONS: The Ozurdex implant in combination with systemic immunomodulatory therapy resulted in improved visual acuity, control of intraocular inflammation, and a decrease in corticosteroid use. In the majority of eyes the uveitis reoccurred around 4 months after injection. The adverse events in our study are similar to those identified in adult studies.",10,2014-Apr-1

Tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-alpha) plays a central role in the pathogenesis of ocular inflammation and the level of TNF-alpha is increased in ocular fluids of patients with uveitis. Intravenous infliximab, a monoclonal antibody against TNF-alpha, has been used for the treatment of uveitis with promising preliminary results. The aim of this study was to evaluate the effect of intravitreal injection of infliximab on experimental uveitis.
METHODS: Thirty-three white New Zealand rabbits were divided randomly into three groups. Group 1 (n=5) received intravitreal injection of 1 mg/0.1 cc infliximab plus 0.1 cc normal saline, group 2 (n=14) received intravitreal injection of 2 microg Salmonella typhimurium endotoxin plus 1 mg/0.1 cc infliximab, and group 3 (n=14) animals received intravitreal endotoxin 2 microg/0.1 cc plus normal saline 0.1 cc. Inflammation was evaluated by clinical examinations on days 1, 3, 5, and 7 after the injections; measuring the protein concentration and inflammatory cell content of the aqueous humor; and histopathologic examination.
RESULTS: No inflammation occurred in group 1 animals. There was a statistically significant difference between group 2 and 3 animals with regard to clinical examination on the third, fifth, and seventh postinjection days. The differences between groups 2 and 3 were significant with regard to aqueous cell counts and protein content at day 7 (p=0.02 and p=0.001, respectively). Histopathologic examination results showed less inflammation in group 2 animals compared to group 3 animals (p=0.009).
CONCLUSIONS: The results provide evidence that intravitreal injection of infliximab suppresses ocular inflammation in a rabbit model of severe endotoxin-induced uveitis.",10,2009-1-1

To determine whether syngeneic retinal cells injected in the vitreous cavity of the rat are able to initiate a proliferative process and whether the ocular inflammation induced in rats by lipopolysaccharide (LPS) promotes this proliferative vitreoretinopathy (PVR).
METHODS: Primary cultured differentiated retinal Müller glial (RMG) and retinal pigmented epithelial (RPE) cells isolated from 8 to 12 postnatal Lewis rats were injected into the vitreous cavity of 8- to 10-week-old Lewis rats (10(5) cells/eye in 2 microlieter sterile saline), with or without the systemic injection of 150 microgram LPS to cause endotoxin-induced uveitis (EIU). Control groups received an intravitreal injection of 2 microliter saline. At 5, 15, and 28 days after cell injections, PVR was clinically quantified, and immunohistochemistry for OX42, ED1, vimentin (VIM), glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP), and cytokeratin was performed.
RESULTS: The injection of RMG cells, alone or in combination with RPE cells, induced the preretinal proliferation of a GFAP-positive tissue, that was enhanced by the systemic injection of LPS. Indeed, when EIU was induced at the time of RMG cell injection into the vitreous cavity, the proliferation led to retinal folds and localized tractional detachments. In contrast, PVR enhanced the infiltration of inflammatory cells in the anterior segment of the eye.
CONCLUSIONS: In the rat, syngeneic retinal cells of glial origin induce PVR that is enhanced by the coinduction of EIU. In return, vitreoretinal glial proliferation enhanced the intensity and duration of EIU.",10,2000-Nov-1

Toxoplasma gondii, Bartonella henselae and feline herpesvirus-1 (FHV-1) have been implicated as causative agents in feline uveitis. The usefulness of serum and aqueous humor (AH) antibody testing for these agents is limited as antibodies can be detected in both healthy cats and cats with uveitis. Very few studies using polymerase chain reaction (PCR) assays to amplify organism DNA from samples from cats with uveitis have been performed. In this study, assays to detect T gondii antibodies, feline leukemia virus antigen, feline immunodeficiency virus antibody, and Bartonella species antibodies were performed on serum and PCR assays for amplification of T gondii, Bartonella species, and FHV-1 DNA were performed on blood and AH samples from 104 cats with endogenous uveitis and 19 healthy cats. Results suggest the addition of the PCR assay to the diagnostic work-up for cats with uveitis will increase the detection of T gondii and FHV-1; however, the diagnostic usefulness of these additional data is not clear.",10,2010-Dec-1

Experimental autoimmune uveoretinitis (EAU) is an organ-specific T cell-mediated disease induced by immunizing mice with interphotoreceptor retinoid binding protein (IRBP). Autoaggressive CD4(+) T cells are the major pathogenic population for EAU. We investigated the contribution of Notch signaling in T cells to EAU pathogenesis because Notch signaling regulates various aspects of CD4(+) T cell functions. Rbpj is required for Notch signaling, and Rbpj deficiency in T cells inhibited EAU disease severity. The amelioration of EAU in T cell-specific Rbpj-deficient mice correlated with low levels of IL-22 production from CD4(+) T cells, although IRBP-specific CD4(+) T cell proliferation and Th17 differentiation were unaffected. Administration of recombinant IL-22 during the late phase, but not the early phase, of EAU increased EAU clinical scores in T cell-specific Rbpj-deficient mice. Notch inhibition in mice immunized with IRBP with a γ-secretase inhibitor (GSI) suppressed EAU progression, even when GSI was administered as late as 13 days after IRBP immunization. Our data demonstrate that Rbpj/Notch-mediated IL-22 production in T cells has a key pathological role in the late phase of EAU, and suggest that Notch blockade might be a useful therapeutic approach for treating EAU.",10,2014-1-1

Copolymer 1 (Cop 1) inhibits experimental allergic encephalomyelitis induced by a variety of myelin proteins, but has been found ineffective so far in inhibiting other experimental autoimmune diseases such as diabetes or arthritis. Here, we report for the first time that Cop I inhibits the development of experimental autoimmune uveoretinitis, induced in mice by interphotoreceptor retinoid-binding protein (IRBP). Pooled data of three experiments showed that treatment with Cop 1, at 0.5 mg/mouse, reduced the disease severity by 53% ( p = 0.0002). Cop 1 treatment also inhibited the proliferation and the production of cytokines by lymph node cells in response to IRBP and moderately reduced the antibody response to this antigen. The possible mechanisms of EAU inhibition by Cop 1 are discussed.",10,2000-Mar-01

Although cataract surgery for senile cataract is routine and easily performed, the decision to remove the cataract in a patient with a history of uveitis is considerably more complex and usually involves multiple considerations, related not only to the cause of the uveitis but also to the appropriate surgical procedures. The problems confronting the ophthalmologist caring for the patient with uveitis begin with the first visit. Establishing a diagnosis and controlling the inflammation are the critical elements in the treatment of the patient; these two factors will determine the incidence of cataract formation and other complications, the appropriate time for cataract removal, and the surgical strategy, as well as determine the visual outcome long before surgery occurs. Diagnosis, control of inflammation, preoperative management, particularities of the surgical techniques, and postoperative complications in patients with a history of uveitis have been reviewed previously in this section. Our aims in this article are to review the literature on this subject over the past year and to reemphasize the idea of a model of zero tolerance for inflammation to minimize the incidence of cataract and irreversible damage of ocular structures essential to good vision.",10,1997-Feb-1

We evaluated the benefits of a novel formulation of vasoactive intestinal peptide (VIP) based on the incorporation of VIP-loaded rhodamine-conjugated liposomes (VIP-Rh-Lip) within hyaluronic acid (HA) gel (Gel-VIP-Rh-Lip) for the treatment of endotoxin-induced uveitis (EIU) in comparison with VIP-Rh-Lip alone. In vitro release study and rheological analysis showed that interactions between HA chains and liposomes resulted in increased viscosity and reinforced elasticity of the gel. In vivo a single intravitreal injection of Gel-VIP-Rh-Lip was performed in rats 7 days prior to uveitis induction by subcutaneous lipopolysaccharide injection. The maximal ocular inflammation occurs within 16-24 h in controls (VIP-Rh-Lip, unloaded-Rh-Lip). Whereas intraocular injection of VIP-Rh-Lip had no effect on EIU severity compared with controls, Gel-VIP-Rh-Lip reduced significantly the clinical score and number of inflammatory cells infiltrating the eye. The fate of liposomes, VIP and HA in the eyes, regional and inguinal lymph nodes and spleen was analyzed by immunostaining and fluorescence microscopy. Retention of liposomes by HA gel was observed in vitro and in vivo. Inflammation severity seemed to impact on system stability resulting in the delayed release of VIP. Thus, HA gel containing VIP-Rh-Lip is an efficient strategy to obtain a sustained delivery of VIP in ocular and lymph node tissues.",10,2009-Oct-01

Juvenile idiopathic arthritis (JIA)-associated uveitis can lead to ocular complications and vision loss. Alleles HLA-DRB1*08, *11, and *13 are risk alleles for JIA, whereas HLA-DRB1*11 and *13 alleles increase uveitis susceptibility. We examined the association of common HLA-DRB1 alleles in children with JIA alone and JIA-associated uveitis.
METHODS: High-resolution HLA-DRB1 genotyping was performed in 107 children with oligoarticular and polyarticular rheumatoid factor (RF) negative JIA and 373 non-Hispanic white controls. Children with JIA alone and JIA-associated uveitis were of similar race, ethnicity, sex, and age at arthritis diagnosis. Odds ratios (OR) and 95% confidence intervals (CI) were calculated.
RESULTS: There were 47 children with JIA-associated uveitis and 60 with JIA alone. Compared to controls, only children with JIA-associated uveitis had increased odds of carriage of HLA-DRB1*11 (OR, 2.2 95% [CI, 1.1-4.3], P = 0.023). There also was increased carriage of HLA-DRB1*08 and *13 (OR, 12.6 [95% CI, 2.0-77.8], P = 0.011). Compared to controls and children with JIA alone, those with JIA-associated uveitis had increased odds of carriage of HLA-DRB1*11 and *13 (OR, 9 [95% CI, 2.8-29.0], P < 0.0001 and OR, 8.6 [95% CI, 1.0-74.4], P = 0.042), respectively.
CONCLUSIONS: We report the novel finding that carriage of HLA-DRB1*11 and *13 appears to increase the risk of uveitis in children with JIA.",10,2015-Sep-1

To evaluate ocular complications of juvenile idiopathic arthritis (JIA)-related uveitis; to study macular morphology and sensitivity.
METHODS: Retrospective chart review of 67 patients. Fourteen consecutive patients (24 eyes) observed from January to December 2008 were submitted to optical coherence tomography study (OCT) and microperimetry MP-1 examination.
RESULTS: Most frequent complications were posterior synechiae (63.0%), band keratopathy (53.9%), and cataract (31.8%). Posterior complications were documented in 37.0% of eyes: 13.8% macular edema, 12.0% papillitis, 6.8% epiretinal membranes, 2.5% retinal vasculitis, 1.7% retinal detachment. At OCT examination 25.0% of eyes presented macular edema; macular sensitivity by MP-1 was < or = 16.5 dB in 25.0% of eyes.
CONCLUSIONS: Visual prognosis is good despite ocular complications. Incidence of macular edema seems to be higher when using OCT. Microperimetry may represent a useful tool in detecting alteration in retinal sensitivity that may supplement visual acuity in the follow-up of macular edema.",10,2010-Jan-1

To examine demographic and clinical characteristics and long-term visual outcome in a cohort of Italian patients affected by Behçet's uveitis (BU).
MATERIALS AND METHODS: Retrospective chart review of 47 patients with BU attending our unit between January 2018 and December 2019. Ophthalmologic manifestations, best-corrected visual acuity (BCVA), fluoroangiography and optical coherence tomography findings, and ocular complications were recorded. Predictive factors of a poor visual outcome and long-term complications were also investigated.
RESULTS: Forty-seven patients (23 males and 24 females) for a total of 84 eyes were enrolled. Uveitis was bilateral in 37 (78.7%) patients with panuveitis being the most frequent anatomical pattern (40 out of 84 eyes), whereas 27 eyes presented a posterior uveitis. Isolated anterior uveitis was detected in 16 eyes. A significant improvement of median BCVA between baseline and last follow-up values was detected (
CONCLUSIONS: In Italian patients, BU typically arises in the third decade and predominantly manifests as a bilateral posterior uveitis or panuveitis. Its duration is associated with a poor visual prognosis. Uveitis duration, the presence of HLA-B51, and panuveitis are predictors of long-term structural complications, thus representing main drivers in the treatment decision-making.",10,2020-1-1

Macular oedema is a common complication and vision-limiting factor in uveitis. The aim of this study was to compare retinal thickness as measured by optical coherence tomography and photoreceptor function as measured by fundus-related microperimetry with respect to their correlation with visual acuity.
METHODS: Prospective observational monocentre study. Thirty-one patients (53 eyes) with endogenous uveitis and fluorescein angiographically confirmed macular oedema were evaluated. Foveal thickness was analysed using spectral-domain (Spectralis(TM) ; Heidelberg Engineering, Heidelberg, Germany) OCT and retinal sensitivity was assessed using fundus-related microperimetry (MP1; Nidek Technologies, Padova, Italy). All findings were correlated with best-corrected visual acuity (BCVA).
RESULTS: Foveal thickness was correlated with BCVA [p = 0.005, r = 0.38, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.12-0.59]. For microperimetry measurements, a negative correlation with logMAR visual acuity was found. Fixation abnormalities were not associated with poor visual acuity, increased foveal thickness or retinal sensitivity. In eyes with cystoid changes in the outer plexiform and inner nuclear layer, foveal thickness was increased (p < 0.0001). Epiretinal membrane formation was present in 70%. In these eyes, foveal thickness was significantly increased (p = 0.003) and visual acuity was worse (p = 0.08).
CONCLUSION: Foveal thickness and fundus-related microperimetry were correlated with visual acuity. Cystoid changes in the outer plexiform and inner nuclear layer and the presence of epiretinal membrane were associated with poor visual acuity. Fixation abnormalities were not associated with poor visual acuity.",10,2011-Sep-1

To identify risk factors associated with relapse of uveitis in patients with recurrent uveitis associated with juvenile idiopathic arthritis (JIA) after treatment with immunomodulatory therapy (IMT) and durable remission of 1 year.
METHODS: The medical records of 30 patients with JIA-associated uveitis who were successfully treated with IMT to a state of corticosteroid-free remission and subsequently remained in remission after discontinuation of IMT for a period of at least 1 year were retrospectively reviewed. In subsequent follow-up, some patients had relapse of uveitis, whereas others continued to be in remission. Remission was defined as <1 + cells in the anterior chamber and <1 + vitreous haze grading; relapse was defined as ≥ 1 + cell in the anterior chamber or ≥ 1 + vitreous haze grading.
RESULTS: A total of 30 patients were included. Of these, 17 (56.7%) patients remained in uveitic remission, whereas 13 (43.3%) relapsed. The patients in remission received IMT earlier in the course of disease compared with patients who relapsed (median, 12 months vs 72 months; P = 0.002 [Mann-Whitney test]). Patients in remission had received treatment with IMT at a younger age compared with the relapse group (median age, 7 years vs 13 years; P = 0.02 [Mann-Whitney test]). None of the other factors studied revealed a statistically significant association.
CONCLUSIONS: Patients with JIA-associated uveitis who were treated with IMT earlier in the course of disease and at a younger age were associated with a lower rate of relapse of uveitis after durable remission and 1 year of quiescence, compared with similar patients who relapsed.",10,2013-Oct-1

Stem cell technology has evoked considerable excitement among people interested in the welfare of animals, as it has suggested the potential availability of new tools for several pathologies, including eye disease, which in many cases is considered incurable. One such example is ulcerative keratitis, which is very frequent in horses. Because some of these corneal ulcers can be very severe, progress rapidly and, therefore, can be a possible cause of vision loss, it is important to diagnose them at an early stage and administer an appropriate treatment, which can be medical, surgical, or a combination of both. The therapeutic strategy should eradicate the infection in order to reduce or stop destruction of the cornea. In addition, it should support the corneal structures and control the uveal reaction, and the pain associated with it, in order to minimize scarring. In this study, we address how stem cells derived from peripheral blood can be used also in ophthalmological pathologies. Our results demonstrate that this treatment protocol improved eye disease in four horse cases, including corneal ulcers and one case of retinal detachment. In all cases, we detected a decrease in the intense inflammatory reaction as well as the restoration of the epithelial surface of the central cornea.",10,2012-Mar-1

Axial spondyloarthritis (axSpA), psoriatic arthritis (PsA), psoriasis, inflammatory bowel disease (IBD), and noninfectious uveitis form a distinct group among the immune mediated inflammatory diseases. Thus, many patients suffer from more than one of these disease manifestations. Here, we will use the term spondylitis-psoriasis-enthesitis-enterocolitis-dactylitis-uveitis-peripheral synovitis (SPEED-UP) spectrum disease. The aim is to review the new targeted pharmacological treatment options for all these diseases. All biological or targeted synthetic drugs with U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) or European Medicines Agency (EMA) approval for any of the diagnoses axSpA, PsA, psoriasis, IBD, or non-infectious uveitis were included. Some of the drugs have documented efficacy in more than one of the diseases, e.g. tumor necrosis factor (TNF) inhibitors. However, other drugs are particularly effective for a specific inflamed tissue and approved in only one or two of the disease entities, e.g. abatacept for peripheral arthritis and vedolizumab for inflammatory bowel disease. This contributes with bedside to bench understanding of the immunology underlying this disease spectrum and provides clinicians with an overview that can assist stratified treatment decisions. We hope that this review will help guide clinicians to speed up treatment of patients with this disease spectrum.",10,2021-Feb-1

Intraocular lens implantation in uveitis patients has been a controversial issue. The purpose of this study is to evaluate the visual and surgical outcomes of extracapsular cataract extraction (ECCE) and posterior chamber intraocular lens (PC IOL) implantation in a diverse group of uveitis patients.
PATIENTS AND METHODS: The results of 39 cases of ECCE and PC IOL implantation in 30 patients with uveitis were retrospectively analyzed. Five patients (six eyes) had pars plana vitrectomies combined with ECCE and PC IOL implantation. Patient age ranged from 26 to 71 years (average, 53.0 years). Specific uveitic syndromes were determined for 22 patients (73.3%). The postoperative follow-up period ranged from 6 to 43 months (average, 20.3 months).
RESULTS: Visual acuity improved postoperatively in 38 eyes (97.4%), and this improvement ranged from 1 to 11 Snellen lines (average, 7.5 Snellen lines). Visual acuity improved postoperatively to 20/40 or better in 32 eyes (82%). Seven eyes had visual acuity worse than 20/40, which was attributed to posterior segment abnormalities after ECCE and PC IOL implantation. Uveitis recurred in 20 eyes (51.3%), and postoperative cystoid macular edema (CME) was observed in 18 eyes (46.2%). In all cases, the recurrent uveitis and CME improved or resolved with corticosteroid therapy.
CONCLUSION: These results suggest selected uveitis patients can have improved vision without unacceptable risk for 1 to 3 years after ECCE and PC IOL implantation.",10,1992-Aug-1

To evaluate the effect of infliximab over the initial 4 years of treatment on inflammatory ocular attacks and background retinal/disc vascular leakage in patients with refractory uveoretinitis associated with Behçet's disease.
METHODS: Clinical records of nine patients were retrospectively reviewed. The main outcomes analyzed were frequency of ocular inflammatory attacks, background retinal and disc vascular leakage as assessed by fluorescein angiography during periods of clinical quiescence, best-corrected visual acuity, and adverse effects.
RESULTS: The median follow-up on infliximab was 50 months (range 48-58 months). Mean frequency of attacks decreased significantly in years 1, 2, 3, and 4 compared with the baseline 1-year period before infliximab use. Mean background retinal and disc vascular leakage scores also decreased significantly at the end of each 1-year period compared with baseline. Visual acuity improved or was unchanged at the end of 4 years in 17 of 18 eyes. No serious adverse effects were observed.
CONCLUSION: Infliximab reduced the mean frequency of ocular attacks and mean background retinal/disc vascular leakage in a long-term sustained manner over 4 years of treatment in Behçet's disease patients.",10,2014-Sep-1

Immunotherapy and targeted therapy for metastatic cancer may cause immune-related adverse events (irAEs) such as uveitis. If irAEs are severe or require systemic steroids, cancer therapy is often held or discontinued. Local steroid therapy for cancer therapy-associated uveitis allows the continuation of cancer therapy. This series demonstrates successful management of cancer therapy-associated uveitis with local therapy based on uveitis subtype.
METHODS: This is an Institutional Review Board-approved retrospective case series of patients with uveitis secondary to immunotherapy or targeted therapy managed with local treatment, and focused literature review.
RESULTS: Five patients (median age: 54, range 31 to 75) were included. Time to uveitis onset following cancer therapy initiation was 3 to 12 months. All patients received checkpoint inhibitor therapy; one patient additionally received targeted therapy. Two patients presented with anterior uveitis, two with panuveitis and one with posterior uveitis. Four of five patients demonstrated evidence of posterior segment inflammation on multimodal imaging. Anterior uveitis was successfully treated with topical prednisolone acetate 1% (PA 1%) alone, and posterior segment involvement recalcitrant to topical PA 1% was treated successfully with topical difluprednate, intravitreal triamcinolone acetonide or a combination. Patients with isolated anterior uveitis did not require maintenance topical therapy; those with posterior and panuveitis required chronic low-dose topical therapy.
CONCLUSION: Based on our series as well as the existing literature demonstrating the use of local therapy for irAEs, we propose an approach to local therapy for cancer therapy-associated uveitis starting with topical steroids and initiating injectable steroids in cases of recalcitrant panuveitis or posterior uveitis. Subclinical inflammation on posterior segment imaging responds robustly to difluprednate or intravitreal steroid therapy, and patients with posterior segment involvement may require more aggressive management and long-term maintenance.",10,2020-May-1

The aim of this study was to quantify the proportion of regulatory T cells (Treg ) and cytokine expression by peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) in patients with active non-infectious uveitis, and to evaluate the effect of in-vitro treatment with infliximab, dexamethasone and cyclosporin A on Treg levels and cytokine production in PBMCs from uveitis patients and healthy subjects. We included a group of 21 patients with active non-infectious uveitis and 18 age-matched healthy subjects. The proportion of forkhead box protein 3 (FoxP3)(+) Treg cells and intracellular tumour necrosis factor (TNF)-α expression in CD4(+) T cells was determined by flow cytometry. PBMCs were also either rested or activated with anti-CD3/anti-CD28 and cultured in the presence or absence of dexamethasone, cyclosporin A and infliximab. Supernatants of cultured PBMCs were collected and TNF-α, interleukin (IL)-10, IL-17 and interferon (IFN)-γ levels were measured by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA). No significant differences were observed in nTreg levels between uveitis patients and healthy subjects. However, PBMCs from uveitis patients produced significantly higher amounts of TNF-α and lower amounts of IL-10. Dexamethasone treatment in vitro significantly reduced FoxP3(+) Treg levels in PBMCs from both healthy subjects and uveitis patients, and all tested drugs significantly reduced TNF-α production in PBMCs. Dexamethasone and cyclosporin A significantly reduced IL-17 and IFN-γ production in PBMCs and dexamethasone up-regulated IL-10 production in activated PBMCs from healthy subjects. Our results suggest that PBMCs from patients with uveitis express more TNF-α and less IL-10 than healthy subjects, and this is independent of FoxP3(+) Treg levels. Treatment with infliximab, dexamethasone and cyclosporin A in vitro modulates cytokine production, but does not increase the proportion of FoxP3(+) Treg cells.",10,2015-Mar-1

In acute inflammation, the tissue damage is generally mediated through polymorphonuclear leukocytes and macrophages. Recent studies on the mechanism of this leukocyte-mediated cytolysis have demonstrated that these cells, on stimulation, release a variety of reactive products. These metabolic products consist of superoxide and hydrogen peroxide, which in turn can form highly reactive species such as hydroxyl radicals. It is believed that these oxygen products play an important role in the tissue damage that occurs in inflammations such as uveitis. The ocular structures contain various antioxidant enzymes that normally protect against free radical mediated injury. In experimental animal models of uveitis, it has been shown that antioxidants and free radical scavengers can function as antiinflammatory agents and can protect the eye from inflammation-mediated tissue damage.",10,1987-1-1

To investigate pathogenesis underlying endogenous uveitis, macrophage migration inhibitory factor (MIF) was quantified in sera of patients.
METHODS: Sera were obtained from the 55 patients with uveitis (24 with Behçet's disease; 9 with Vogt-Koyanagi-Harada's [VKH] disease; 22 with sarcoidosis) and 58 healthy control subjects. MIF levels were determined by a human MIF enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay.
RESULTS: The mean MIF levels in the sera of the patients with Behçet's disease, VKH disease, and sarcoidosis and of healthy control subjects were 60.4+/-9.0 (mean+/-SE) ng/ml, 16.5+/-2.9 ng/ml, 27.1+/-5.6 ng/ml, and 5.4+/-0.04 ng/ml, respectively. The average levels of MIF in the sera of uveitis patients were significantly higher (P < 0.0001) than those of healthy control subjects. The high levels of MIF were especially noted in patients with Behçet's disease at the ocular exacerbation stage and patients with sarcoidosis at the severe uveitis stage.
CONCLUSIONS: Significant increase of MIF in sera was characteristic of uveitis, and MIF may be a usefull laboratory parameter to use to comprehend the clinical course of uveitis.",10,1999-Jan-1

In this open-label trial, ten male patients with active Behcet's uveitis were enrolled. Initially, two infliximab infusions (5 mg/kg) were given at weeks 0 and 2. The patients continued to receive conventional therapy on recurrence of severe uveitis (RSU) attack. The patients with further attack were regularly given infliximab infusions every 8 weeks. In cases of further RSU attacks, the infusion interval was reduced to 6 weeks. The total follow-up period was 3 years. The patients were monitored for RSU, visual acuity and adverse effects. Reduction in the doses of prednisolone was also monitored. After receiving two infliximab infusions at weeks 0 and 2, three patients remained attack-free and seven patients had another RSU attack between 8th and 47th week. These patients were regularly given infliximab at 8-week intervals. Five out of seven patients remained attack-free. In two patients who had further attack, infusion frequency was increased to 6 weeks. There was a remarkable improvement in visual acuity with no significant adverse reaction except mild respiratory tract infection (two patients), headache (one patient) and mild infusion reaction (one patient). Infliximab is a safe and effective drug for the management of Behcet's uveitis. Selection of optimal dose and frequency of infusion required standardization for individual patient.",10,2008-Nov-1

To investigate whether the cytokine interleukin-8 (IL-8), a strong chemoattractant and activator for neutrophils, is responsible for neutrophil infiltration and degranulation in the eye in uveitis.
METHODS: IL-8 and elastase were measured with specific enzyme-linked immunoassays in vitreous fluid samples obtained from 69 patients with various uveitis entities. Vitreous fluid of nonuveitis patients and eye bank eyes served as controls. The chemotactic activity of vitreous fluid was tested with the Boyden chamber technique.
RESULTS: IL-8 was detected in 45% of the vitreous fluid samples from uveitis patients and in 26% of vitreous fluid samples from nonuveitis patients. Vitreous fluid samples with IL-8 levels exceeding 100 pg/ml were chemotactic for neutrophils. This chemotactic activity could be blocked by 41% to 79% with a monoclonal anti-IL-8 antibody. Elastase levels in vitreous fluid of uveitis patients with detectable IL-8 were significantly higher than those in vitreous fluid samples with no detectable IL-8.
CONCLUSION: These results indicate that IL-8 participates in the inflammatory processes in the eye by attracting and degranulating neutrophils. It is suggested that these processes contribute to the pathogenesis of tissue destruction in uveitis.",10,1993-Nov-1

This meta-analysis investigated the frequency and type of ocular involvement in juvenile inflammatory arthritis (JIA) and other juvenile rheumatic diseases.
METHODS: Medline, Web of Science and Cochrane databases were searched from inception to September 2018 to identify publications related to juvenile arthritis and rheumatic diseases, which reported frequency of Uveitis in juvenile rheumatic conditions and contained at least 20 patients. The prevalence and type of eye complications were extracted, and random effects models estimated their frequency. Heterogeneity was evaluated using I
RESULTS: In total, 7132 unique citations resulted in 59 articles included. Pooled frequency of uveitis was: 24% in oligoarticular JIA, 12% in polyarticular JIA, 1% in systemic JIA, 50% in pediatric Bechet's, 9% in juvenile psoriatic arthritis, 24% in juvenile spondyloarthropathy and 5% in juvenile systemic lupus erythematosus. The most common uveitis in JIA was anterior uveitis, which occurred in 14%; also described as iridocyclitis in 10% of patients. Publication bias was negligible for all conditions except those with few reported studies (juvenile SLE and systemic JIA). Uveitis in JIA was more common in Europe (14%), North America (11%) and the Middle East (12%) than East Asia (7%) and Oceania (3%).
CONCLUSIONS: Ocular involvement (mostly uveitis) in juvenile inflammatory arthritis and other pediatric rheumatic diseases varied between 3% and 50% depending on the underlying condition; and was highest in pediatric Bechet's. In JIA, the highest frequency of uveitis was in oligoarticular JIA; with anterior uveitis being the most frequent type of uveitis.

To examine postoperative ocular hypertension (POH) and other variables as predictors of the risk of developing glaucoma after cataract surgery in dogs.
DESIGN: Retrospective study.
ANIMALS: 220 dogs that had cataract surgery.
PROCEDURE: Medical records of 220 dogs (346 eyes) that had extracapsular cataract removal or phacoemulsification of cataracts were reviewed. With respect to glaucoma development, 8 variables were analyzed, which included development of POH, breed, sex, age at time of surgery, eye (right vs left), phacoemulsification time, intraocular lens (IOL) placement (yes or no), and stage of cataract development. Eyes developed glaucoma within 6 or 12 months of surgery or did not have signs of glaucoma at least 6 or 12 months after cataract surgery.
RESULTS: Of 346 eyes, 58 (16.8%) developed glaucoma after surgery. At 6 months, 32 of 206 (15.5%) eyes examined had glaucoma; at 12 months, 44 of 153 (28.8%) eyes examined had glaucoma. Median follow-up time was 5.8 months (range, 0.1 to 48 months). Mixed-breed dogs were at a significantly lower risk for glaucoma, compared with other breeds. Eyes with IOL placement were at a significantly lower risk for glaucoma, compared with eyes without IOL placement. Eyes with hypermature cataracts were at a significantly higher risk for glaucoma, compared with eyes with mature or immature cataracts.
CONCLUSIONS AND CLINICAL RELEVANCE: Multiple factors appear to contribute to the onset of glaucoma in dogs after cataract surgery. Complications prohibiting IOL placement during cataract surgery may lead to a high risk of glaucoma development.",10,2000-Jun-01

To determine the association between anticytomegalovirus (CMV) maintenance therapy after immune recovery and immune recovery uveitis in acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS) patients on highly active antiretroviral therapy (HAART).
DESIGN: Observational cohort study.
METHODS: Data were obtained on AIDS patients with CMV retinitis followed up at the AIDS Ocular Research Unit of University of California San Diego from November 1995 to October 1999. Immune recovery was defined as CD4 count greater than 50 cells/microl for more than 3 months. Patients with immune recovery uveitis presented with vitritis, cystoid macular edema, or epiretinal membrane. Statistical analyses were conducted to determine the risk of continued use of anti-CMV therapy after immune recovery and the relationship of developing immune recovery uveitis with the type of anti-CMV therapy.
RESULTS: Forty-three patients (64 eyes) had healed CMV retinitis and had achieved immune recovery. Thirty-one patients (48 eyes) received anti-CMV therapy after immune recovery, and 20 patients (29 eyes) developed immune recovery uveitis. Per-eye analyses revealed a 3.8-fold increase in the odds of developing immune recovery uveitis with anti-CMV therapy compared with no treatment (P =.02). If treated with cidofovir the odds were 3.3 greater than if treated with an alternative regimen (P =.04), 4.1 greater if treated intravenously (P =.01), and 5.2 greater than if not treated (P =.004). If not treated with cidofovir, a nonsignificant increase in the risk (2.4) of immune recovery uveitis was found (P =.15). Neither the potency nor the use of implants for noncidofovir treatment was related to the risk of recovery uveitis (P >.62).
CONCLUSIONS: The use of cidofovir is a primary risk factor in the subsequent development of immune recovery uveitis. Ongoing treatment of healed CMV retinitis after immune recovery does not appear to protect against the development of immune recovery uveitis.",10,2003-Oct-1

Rapamycin (RAPA) is a macrolide antibiotic with unique immunosuppressive properties. RAPA inhibits T-cell function by interfering with IL-2 and IL-4 signal transduction. It does not prevent IL-2 production or IL-2R expression. The efficacy of RAPA in the treatment of autoimmune diseases was evaluated using the experimental autoimmune uveoretinitis (EAU) model. EAU was actively induced in Lewis rats by immunization with S-antigen in Hunter's adjuvant. RAPA and control vehicle were administered by continuous intravenous infusion over a 14 day period by miniosmotic pump. RAPA treatment initiated on the day of immunization or 7 days later was found to efficiently inhibit EAU induction. The minimal effective dose was 0.1 mg/kg/d. EAU inhibition was correlated with reduced number of cells in the immunization site draining lymph nodes, as well as with a shift and lowering of the peak of the lymphocyte proliferative response curve. The anti-S-antigen antibody response was delayed by 3 days under RAPA treatment and the serum levels lowered in a dose dependent manner. An initial body weight loss was observed during the first week of drug administration, but there was a normal weight gain afterward.",10,1993-Feb-1

To investigate the role of TNF-alpha in endotoxin-induced uveitis (EIU) in mice.
METHODS: To neutralize TNF-alpha activity, mice were pretreated with either repeated injections of this cytokine or a single injection of antibody against it. The mice were then injected intraperitoneally with 500 micrograms endotoxin, to induce lethal septic shock, or into the footpad with 200 micrograms to induce EIU.
RESULTS: Although both pretreatments conferred protection against the systemic toxic effects of LPS, TNF-resistant mice and mice treated with anti-TNF-alpha antibody demonstrated an exacerbation of EIU when compared to control animals.
CONCLUSIONS: Unlike its apparent participation in the systemic effect of endotoxin, TNF-alpha is not directly involved in the pathogenesis of EIU and may even protect against the inflammatory processes of this disease.",10,1993-Sep-1

An 8-year-old domestic shorthair cat was examined for severe anterior uveitis of the right eye that was unresponsive to aggressive treatment with anti-inflammatory drugs and for a possible intraocular parasite or foreign body trapped within a large fibrin clot in the anterior chamber. Surgical exploration of a presumed entry site on the caudal aspect of the third eyelid led to keratotomy and removal of a larval parasite later identified as a first instar Cuterebra spp. Aggressive treatment with anti-inflammatory drugs was continued after surgery, and intraocular pressure was monitored closely to ensure that the cat did not develop glaucoma. Two weeks after surgery, the cat had vision in the affected eye, with resolving uveitis and a normal fundus. Six weeks after surgery, the uveitis continued to resolve; however, the cat did not have vision in the affected eye, and examination of the fundus revealed retinal atrophy. In contrast to the condition in humans, a Cuterebra spp larval infection within the eye of cats may cause not only an intense, acute inflammatory reaction, but also retinal degeneration and blindness despite prompt surgical removal.",10,2000-Feb-01

Herpes stromal keratitis is a serious condition and the most frequent cause of unilateral blindness. The real-time PCR is an accurate and fast diagnostic method for an analysis of infectious agents causing keratitis and keratouveitis. The aim of the study was to assess the relationship between clinical symptoms, treatment efficacy monitoring and viral quantity in corneal swabs determined by quantitative real-time PCR method. The real-time PCR method was used as well for the detection of other viral eye pathogens.
METHODS: A total of 212 patients (136 men and 76 women) suspect of having herpes simplex virus (HSV) keratitis or keratouveitis were included in the study. The detection and quantitative analysis of the viral DNA were performed using the EliGene HSV1 RT kit, and the result was correlated with the clinical picture of the disease. The patients were routinely treated with acyclovir applied locally or, alternatively, in systemic administration. In a case of acyclovir treatment resistant keratitis, the patients were treated with local ganciclovir (Virgan gel ophth 0.15%).
RESULTS: A total of 636 analyses of the viral DNA were performed; 85 patients were positive for HSV1 (198 detected). There were 16 acyclovir resistant cases of keratitis (14%).
CONCLUSIONS: The real-time PCR appears as a fast and accurate method for an exact identification of the viral DNA in patients with herpes stromal keratitis. The introduction of the quantification is important for the treatment evaluation and for the specification of a so-called acyclovir resistant keratitis. A long-term systemic administration in maintenance doses may lead to the resistance and repeated, frequent relapses of the disease.",10,2012-Aug-1

Neovascular fundus abnormalities are an unusual complication of peripheral uveitis. Peripheral retinal neovascularization was seen in 11 patients, six of whom had retinal angioma-like lesions. Most of the patients had loss of vision caused by vitreous hemorrhage. In four additional patients with peripheral uveitis, neovascularization developed either at the disc or elsewhere in the posterior pole.",10,1982-May-1

Uveitis is a heterogeneous collection of diseases. We tested the hypothesis that despite the diversity of uveitides, there could be common mechanisms shared by multiple subtypes, and that evidence of these common mechanisms may be detected as gene expression profiles in whole blood.
DESIGN: Cohort study.
METHODS: Ninety subjects with uveitis including axial spondyloarthritis (n = 17), sarcoidosis (n = 13), inflammatory bowel disease (n = 12), tubulointerstitial nephritis with uveitis (n = 10), or idiopathic uveitis (n = 38) as well as 18 healthy controls were enrolled, predominantly at Oregon Health & Science University. RNA-Seq data generated from peripheral, whole blood identified 19,859 unique transcripts. We analyzed gene expression pathways via Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes and Gene Ontology (GO). We validated our list of upregulated genes by comparison to a previously published study on peripheral blood gene expression among 50 subjects with diverse forms of uveitis.
RESULTS: Both the Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes and GO analysis identified multiple shared pathways or GO terms with a P value of <.0001. Almost all pathways related to the immune response and/or response to an infection. A total of 119 individual transcripts were upregulated by at least 1.5-fold and false discovery rate <.05, and 61 were downregulated by similar criteria. Comparing mRNA from our study with a false discovery rate <.05 and the prior report, we identified 10 common gene transcripts: ICAM1, IL15RA, IL15, IRF1, IL10RB, GSK3A, TYK2, MEF2A, MEF2B, and MEF2D.
CONCLUSIONS: Many forms of uveitis share overlapping mechanisms. These data support the concept that a single therapeutic approach could benefit diverse forms of this disease.",10,2021-Jun-1

To identify the possible risk factors for the development of cataract requiring surgery in children with juvenile idiopathic arthritis (JIA)-associated uveitis.
DESIGN: Retrospective cohort study.
METHODS: Data of 53 children with JIA-associated uveitis, of whom 27 had undergone cataract extraction (CE), were obtained. The main outcome measure, the interval between the onset of uveitis and the first CE (U-CE interval), was examined in relation to clinical and ophthalmologic characteristics and treatment strategies before CE.
RESULTS: A shorter U-CE interval was found for children with posterior synechia vs those without posterior synechia (hazard ratio [HR], 3.57; 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.33 to 10.00). No significant difference was found for children in whom the uveitis was the first manifestation of JIA vs those in whom arthritis was the first manifestation of JIA (HR, 1.59; 95% CI, 0.63 to 4.00) and children treated with periocular corticosteroid injections vs those not treated with periocular corticosteroid injections (HR, 3.23; 95% CI, 0.95 to 11.11). Children treated with methotrexate (MTX) had a longer U-CE interval than children not treated with MTX (HR, 0.29; 95% CI, 0.10 to 0.87).
CONCLUSIONS: The risk factor for development of early cataract requiring surgery in children with JIA-associated uveitis is the presence of posterior synechia at the time of diagnosis of uveitis. However, early treatment with MTX is associated with a mean delay in the development of cataract requiring surgery of 3.5 years.",10,2007-Oct-1

To evaluate an interferon γ release assay in the diagnosis of uveitis associated with tuberculosis (TB), in the absence of a gold standard.
METHODS: We conducted a prospective 1-year study on consecutive patients with a new diagnosis of uveitis presenting with ocular signs suggestive of TB-associated uveitis (TAU). All subjects underwent ocular and systemic review with investigations, including T-SPOT.TB assay and tuberculin skin test (TST). The main outcome measures were sensitivity and specificity; positive and negative predictive values (PPV, NPV) of T-SPOT.TB were estimated using Bayesian statistics (presented with 95% Bayesian credible intervals (CrI)).
RESULTS: Analysis after exclusion of patients with indeterminate results and other diseases included 191 patients, with mean age of 47.2±15.3 years. The majority were Chinese (n=110, 57.6%) and women (n=102, 53.4%). The TST (0.70, 0.65 to 0.75) was more sensitive compared to T-SPOT.TB (0.53, 0.42 to 0.66) but the T-SPOT.TB (0.91, 0.88 to 0.93) was more specific than TST (0.71, 0.58 to 0.83). The T-SPOT.TB had a higher PPV (0.88, 0.80 to 0.93) compared to the TST (0.76, 0.57 to 0.90), but a lower NPV (0.60, 0.38 to 0.78) than the TST (0.65, 0.46 to 0.78). Patients who are TST and T-SPOT.TB positive are very likely (95.1% likelihood) to have TAU (39/41 95% CrI 35 to 41). Based on statistical decision theory, in populations where the prevalence of TAU is high the TST should be the first-choice test; the T-SPOT.TB should be performed if the prevalence of TB is low.
CONCLUSIONS: The T-SPOT.TB assay is more specific but less sensitive than the TST and should be used in preference to the TST in low-TB-prevalence populations. Used in conjunction, the likelihood of TAU is greatest if the T-SPOT.TB and TST are both positive.",10,2013-Aug-1

To examine antigen-stimulated cytokine production by Behçet disease patients (BD) before and after infliximab infusion.
METHODS: PBMCs were obtained before and after infliximab infusion in BD patients with or without recurrent uveitis during at least 1 year of infliximab therapy, and from healthy subjects. PBMCs were cultured with IRBP, and Th-related cytokines in cultures were measured.
RESULTS: Levels of IL-4, IL-6, IL-10 IL-17A, IL-17F, IL-31, IFN-γ, and TNFα were higher in BD before infliximab infusion than in healthy subjects, and these levels were the highest in BD with recurrent uveitis. After infliximab infusion, these cytokine levels were reduced to a greater extent in BD without recurrent uveitis than in BD with recurrence.
CONCLUSIONS: Th-related cytokines produced by IRBP-stimulated PBMCs were elevated in BD, and infliximab infusion suppressed these cytokines to a greater extent in BD without recurrent uveitis than in those with recurrence.",10,2017-Feb-1

To determine the use of high-frequency ultrasound biomicroscopy (UBM) in the assessment of inflammatory lesions of the iris, ciliary body, pars plana and peripheral vitreous, and in particular to determine the proportion of cases for which UBM contributed significant additional, hitherto inaccessible, information.
METHODS: Charts of patients seen in the uveitis clinic at University Eye Hospital from November 1994 to September 1999 for whom a UBM investigation had been performed were analysed. UBM was performed in a standard manner, using a Humphrey UBM 840 system. The clinical relevance of the UBM findings was determined for the whole series and for the following six subgroups of patients arbitrarily established according to the type and location of pathology: hypotony, pseudophakic uveitis, iris and ciliary body pathology excluding hypotony, pars plana pathology, scleritis and Toxocara uveitis. Findings were classified as positive when they confirmed a suspected diagnosis of lesional process or when they gave essential information. Findings were classified as essential when they led to the diagnosis or when they modified therapeutic intervention.
RESULTS: During the study period 111 eyes of 77 patients were included. UBM findings contributed essential information that allowed a diagnosis to be reached or that influenced treatment in 43% of cases. It yielded positive findings in 91% of cases, enabling assessment of morphological changes in the iris, ciliary body, and retroiridal and peripheral vitreous induced by intraocular inflammatory or pseudo-inflammatory disorders. Specific UBM signs, present in all patients, were identified in Toxocara uveitis. The groups of patients that benefited most from UBM examination were those with hypotony (83% essential findings) and opaque media (100% essential findings).
CONCLUSION: For uveitis patients with an inflammatory process situated in the iris/ciliary body/pars plana/retroiridal vitreous areas, UBM was of great clinical value and improved the management in a significant manner.",10,2001-Feb-1

This study was designed to investigate the suppressive effects of antithrombin (AT)III on inflammatory reactions during endotoxin-induced uveitis (EIU) in rats by studying leukocyte-endothelium interactions.
METHODS: EIU was induced in Lewis rats by footpad injection of lipopolysaccharide (LPS). ATIII was administered immediately after or at 6 hours after LPS injection. Its suppressive effects on inflammatory leukocyte behavior were evaluated in vivo with acridine orange digital fluorography. Clinical signs of inflammation were also examined, and aqueous humor (AH) was collected to evaluate leukocyte infiltration and protein leakage. In a separate experiment, P-selectin mRNA expression was studied in the iris-ciliary body (ICB) and the retina.
RESULTS: After treatment with ATIII, leukocyte rolling was substantially inhibited along the retinal veins, suppressing subsequent leukocyte infiltration into the vitreous cavity. Similarly, leukocyte infiltration and protein leakage into the AH were significantly reduced with ATIII treatment. The clinical grade of EIU was substantially lower in ATIII-treated rats. In addition, delayed administration of ATIII after EIU induction significantly attenuated these inflammatory reactions. The levels of P-selectin mRNA expression in both ICB and retina, which were upregulated after LPS injection, were substantially lower in the ATIII-treated rats.
CONCLUSIONS: ATIII treatment significantly inhibited inflammatory reactions induced with LPS. Its suppressive effects on P-selectin expression could contribute to the attenuation of leukocyte infiltration, possibly by inhibiting leukocyte rolling. The current findings suggest that ATIII may have a role in the management of patients with uveitis.",10,2001-Jun-1

To determine classification criteria for Behçet disease uveitis.
DESIGN: Machine learning of cases with Behçet disease and 5 other panuveitides.
METHODS: Cases of panuveitides were collected in an informatics-designed preliminary database, and a final database was constructed of cases achieving supermajority agreement on the diagnosis, using formal consensus techniques. Cases were split into a training set and a validation set. Machine learning using multinomial logistic regression was used on the training set to determine a parsimonious set of criteria that minimized the misclassification rate among the intermediate uveitides. The resulting criteria were evaluated on the validation set.
RESULTS: One thousand twelve cases of panuveitides, including 194 cases of Behçet disease with uveitis, were evaluated by machine learning. The overall accuracy for panuveitides was 96.3% in the training set and 94.0% in the validation set (95% confidence interval 89.0, 96.8). Key criteria for Behçet disease uveitis were a diagnosis of Behçet disease using the International Study Group for Behçet Disease criteria and a compatible uveitis, including (1) anterior uveitis; (2) anterior chamber and vitreous inflammation; (3) posterior uveitis with retinal vasculitis and/or focal infiltrates; or (4) panuveitis with retinal vasculitis and/or focal infiltrates. The misclassification rates for Behçet disease uveitis were 0.6% in the training set and 0% in the validation set, respectively.
CONCLUSIONS: The criteria for Behçet disease uveitis had a low misclassification rate and seemed to perform sufficiently well for use in clinical and translational research.",10,2021-Aug-1

Uveitis is the inflammation of any or all parts of the vascular tunic of the eye; the vascular tunic includes the iris, the ciliary body, and choroid. A good knowledge base, up-to-date reference materials, and good instruments will improve the diagnosis of uveitis. Feline uveitis can be caused by numerous infectious agents in addition to neoplasia and less likely trauma. The infectious causes most commonly associated with feline uveitis include feline leukemia virus, feline immunodeficiency virus, feline infectious peritonitis, systemic fungal infections, toxoplasmosis, and bartonellosis. Neoplastic causes of uveitis can be primary or secondary. Iris melanoma is the most common primary uveal neoplasia and trauma-associated sarcoma is the second most common primary uveal neoplasia. Treatment for the clinical signs of anterior uveitis include topical steroidal or non-steroidal anti-inflammatory agents, parasympatholytic agents for ciliary spasm, to keep the pupil dilated, and to prevent posterior synechia. Posterior uveitis should be treated with systemic medications that will address the underlying cause. Enucleation of blind, painful eyes not responsive to medications is a means to alleviate the animal's discomfort and to further diagnose the underlying cause.",10,2005-May-1

METHODS: Cases of anterior uveitides were collected in an informatics-designed preliminary database, and a final database was constructed of cases achieving supermajority agreement on the diagnosis, using formal consensus techniques. Cases were split into a training set and a validation set. Machine learning using multinomial logistic regression was used on the training set to determine a parsimonious set of criteria that minimized the misclassification rate among the anterior uveitides. The resulting criteria were evaluated on the validation set.
RESULTS: One thousand eighty-three cases of anterior uveitides, including 89 cases of CMV anterior uveitis, were evaluated by machine learning. The overall accuracy for anterior uveitides was 97.5% in the training set and 96.7% in the validation set (95% confidence interval 92.4, 98.6). Key criteria for CMV anterior uveitis included unilateral anterior uveitis with a positive aqueous humor polymerase chain reaction assay for CMV. No clinical features reliably diagnosed CMV anterior uveitis. The misclassification rates for CMV anterior uveitis were 1.3% in the training set and 0% in the validation set.

The efficacy of infliximab (IFX) and adalimumab (ADA) for treating Behçet's syndrome (BS) and sarcoidosis has not been compared adequately.
METHODS: We reviewed the medical records of patients with uveitis diagnosed at Tokyo Medical University Hospital and compared the efficacy of IFX and ADA for BS and the efficacy of ADA for sarcoidosis and BS.
RESULTS: 68 patients in IFX group and 63 patients in ADA group were analyzed. In BS patients, IFX and ADA were both effective in improving uveitic macular edema (UME). ADA improved UME in BS but not in sarcoidosis patients. The efficacy of ADA in reducing doses of corticosteroids and glaucoma medications was better in sarcoidosis than in the BS group.
CONCLUSION: Both IFX and ADA are efficacious in improving UME in BS patients. The reason that ADA improves UME better in BS than in sarcoidosis may be due to the difference in pathogenesis between these diseases.",10,2022-Jan-02

There is debate concerning whether the use of Latanoprost in early postoperative period of cataract surgery and in glaucoma patients with uveitis as it may aggravate the inflammation and results in macular edema (ME), because of blood-ocular barrier disruption. However, there is no solid evidence for disruption of blood-ocular barrier with Latanoprost and aggravation of uveitis or ME formation. Similar to pseudophakic ME, the imaging ME in cases claimed to be secondary to Latanoprost is greater than clinical ME, happens mostly in complicated surgeries, and the vast majority resolve within weeks to months with using a non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drug. The current literature suggests that Latanoprost can be used in patients with uveitis and early after cataract surgery with or without concomitant topical non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs that are currently used by many ophthalmologists as a preventive measure for ME even in non-glaucoma uncomplicated cataract surgeries.",10,2019-1-1

To identify the characteristics of uveitis in a tertiary eye center in Myanmar.
METHODS: A retrospective study was undertaken to obtain the characteristics of uveitis in a tertiary eye center in Myanmar from September 2013 to September 2014, using a standard clinical protocol and tailored laboratory investigations.
RESULTS: A total of 139 patients were included in this epidemiologic study; 71 (51.1%) men and 68 (48.9%) women. The mean age of onset was 36.3 ± 15.5 years. Infectious uveitis constituted 76/139 (54.7%) cases and non-infectious etiologies accounted for 63/139 (45.3%) cases. The most common non-infectious etiologies were idiopathic, followed by HLA-B27-associated anterior uveitis and multifocal choroiditis with panuveitis, while tuberculosis was the most common infectious etiology.

Mycophenolate mofetil (MM), an inhibitor of purine metabolism, was found to effectively inhibit the development of experimental autoimmune uveoretinitis (EAU) induced by S-antigen (SAg) in Lewis rats. MM completely inhibited EAU development in the majority of rats when administered daily, on days 0-13, at a dose of 30 mg kg-1 day-1. The drug was less effective, however, when given on days 7-20: minimal disease inhibition was achieved with the drug at 30 mg kg-1 day-1, although at 60 mg kg-1 day-1 the drug inhibited EAU development in most treated rats during the period of its administration. MM also completely inhibited in most treated rats the development of EAU adoptively transferred by SAg-sensitized lymphocytes, thus depicting its capacity to inhibit the efferent limb of the immune response. Treatment with MM also suppressed the cellular and humoral immune responses against SAg, with a good correlation being observed between the inhibition of these responses and suppression of EAU in the different groups of rats. MM is currently being examined for its immunosuppressive effects in humans and the data recorded here thus suggest this compound may be useful in treatment of immune-mediated uveitic conditions.",10,1995-Oct-1

To alert physician to timely recognition and current treatment of recurrent hypopyon iridocyclitis or panuveitis in ocular Behçet disease (OBD).
RECENT FINDINGS: Interferon-α, rituximab, intravitreal triamcinolone, and biological response modifiers by tumor necrosis factor inhibitors such as infliximab and adalimumab are being used increasingly for the treatment of severe sight-threatening ocular inflammation including retinal vasculitis and cystoid macular edema (CME).
SUMMARY: Biological agents offer tremendous potential in the treatment of OBD. Given that OBD predominantly afflicts the younger adults in their most productive years, dermatologist, rheumatologist, internist, or general practitioners supervising patients with oculo-articulo-oromucocutaneous syndromes should be aware of systemic Behçet disease. Early recognition of ocular involvement is important and such patients should strongly be instructed to visit immediately an ophthalmologist, as uveitis management differs from extraocular involvements with high ocular morbidity from sight-threatening complications due to relapsing inflammatory attacks in the posterior segment of the eye. A single infliximab infusion should be considered for the control of acute panuveitis, whereas repeated long-term infliximab infusions were proved to be more effective in reducing the number of episodes in refractory uveoretinitis with faster regression and complete remission of CME.",10,2011-Nov-1

to review the function and genetics of killer immunoglobulin-like receptors (KIRs) and studies of KIR genetic associations with uveitis.
METHODS: Review of published studies.
RESULTS: KIRs are receptors on NK and some T cells. They may inhibit or activate cellular function, such as cytotoxicity and cytokine production. Studies have been published examining KIR gene associations with birdshot chorioretinopathy (BCR), Vogt-Koyanagi-Harada (VKH) disease, and HLA-B27-associated acute anterior uveitis (AAU) and axial spondyloarthropathy. Evidence for increased activating and/or less inhibitory KIR and HLA gene combinations was found for BCR and VKH disease. In HLA-B27-associated disease, a trend toward decreased activation and stronger inhibition was found, except for the weakly inhibitory 3DL1 and Bw4(T80) combination. This latter combination was also found to confer risk in BCR.
CONCLUSIONS: KIR genetics are complex, as are the functions of KIR-bearing cells. Nonetheless, evidence for KIRs in the pathogenesis of uveitis has been found.",10,2011-Jun-1

This is a retrospective cohort uveitis survey to determine the clinical features of uveitis in children and assess the rate of complications at two referral centres in Saudi Arabia.
METHODS: All children under the age of 16 years presenting with uveitis for the first time between 1997 and 2007 to The Eye Center and King Khaled Eye Specialist Hospital in Riyadh, Saudi Arabia were included. Clinical features of uveitis entities were described. Last follow-up visual acuity and ocular complications were analysed.
RESULTS: A total of 163 cases of uveitis in children were included. The age range was 1-16 years with a mean age of 10 years. The most frequent clinical type of uveitis in children included acute anterior non-granulomatous uveitis 26%, intermediate uveitis 20%, Vogt-Koyanagi-Harada (VKH) disease 16% and juvenile idiopathic arthritis (JIA) 15%. Anterior uveitis accounted for 42%, intermediate for 20%, posterior for 7%, and panuveitis for 31%. Immune-mediated uveitis was present in 144 (88%) patients, while infectious causes manifested in 19 (12%) patients.
CONCLUSIONS: The most common cause of uveitis in children was anterior non-granulomatous uveitis of undetermined aetiology. There was a high prevalence of intermediate uveitis, VKH and JIA. Infectious causes of uveitis were uncommon.",10,2009-May-1

Juvenile idiopathic arthritis (JIA) is the most common disease in pediatric rheumatism. There is no specific symptom or examination finding for JIA, and the diagnosis is made by exclusion and differentiation. Because non-pediatric rheumatologists are sometimes involved in medical care, 'proposal for JIA guidance on diagnosis and treatment for primary care pediatricians and non-pediatric rheumatologists' was first published in 2007. In these 10 years, a number of new findings on pathophysiology and treatment of JIA have been published; therefore, we propose this guidance of 2018th edition aiming at updating and standardization of JIA medical care in Japan. This edition included the management of uveitis, macrophage activation syndrome, infectious diseases before and during treatment. Moreover, details of biologics are also described. Although this guidance is tailored to adaptation of examinations and drugs, we do not purpose to limit the physicians' discretion in clinical practice. This guidance should be viewed as recommendations and be individualized according to the condition of the patient. We hope that medical care for JIA will advance and more patients will get benefit based on this guidance. Then, further revisions are needed due to changes in future conditions.",10,2019-Jan-1

To correlate the structural and functional changes following intravitreal injection of dexamethasone 0.7 mg (Ozurdex®) implant in patients with recalcitrant uveitic cystoid macular edema (CME).
MATERIALS AND METHODS: In a prospective, interventional, nonrandomized study, 30 eyes (27 patients) with uveitic CME received Ozurdex® implant and were followed-up for 24 weeks at periodic intervals to monitor structural alterations seen on spectral domain optical coherence tomography (SD-OCT). The outcome measures included change in central macular thickness (CMT) and best-corrected visual acuity (BCVA) as well as structural alterations seen on OCT such as change in the height of cystoid spaces (CSs) and sub-foveal serous retinal detachment (SSRD). The integrity of external limiting membrane and inner-outer segment junction was assessed at baseline and follow-up visits.
RESULTS: Mean age of the patients was 46.09 ± 15.66 years. The mean CMT decreased by 96 μm at 1-day, 231.64 μm at 1-week, 254.21 μm at 4 weeks and 249.14 μm at 12 weeks (P < 0.001) compared with baseline. BCVA improved from a baseline mean of 0.62 LogMAR units to 0.49 on day 1 to 0.31 at 24 weeks (P < 0.001). A decrease in the mean height of CS, that is, 133.28 μm from a baseline of 317.71 μm was noted on the 1 st day (P < 0.001). 4 eyes demonstrated the presence of CS at 4 weeks, 1 eye at 6 weeks and 3 eyes at 12 weeks. At baseline, 16 eyes (53.33%) demonstrated the presence of SSRD. Among these, 11 eyes showed resolution of SSRD on day 1. SSRD resolved in all patients at 4 weeks and was maintained up to 24 weeks.
CONCLUSIONS: Ozurdex® implant improves the visual outcome of patients with recalcitrant uveitic CME. Reversibility of retinal changes may be possible following treatment with dexamethasone implant. Thus final visual outcome may be independent of pretreatment CMT, the height of CS or SSRD.",10,2015-May-1

To determine whether relationships exist between elevated laser flare photometry values and common abnormalities and complications associated with uveitis.
METHODS: We retrospectively studied all patients with uveitis on whom laser flare photometry measurements (""flare"") were obtained (N = 111) at 2 academic medical centers. The first laser flare photometry values obtained for each patient were compared with the presence or absence of the following abnormalities or complications associated with uveitis: keratic precipitates, posterior synechiae, cataract, macular edema, optic disc edema, and glaucoma. In bilateral cases, the eye with the higher flare was used in primary analyses.
RESULTS: Flare was significantly higher in patients with posterior synechiae (P<.001) and in those with macular edema (P =.02) than in patients with uveitis who did not have these complications. Flare was significantly higher in patients with prior cataract surgery or cataract at the study visit than in those without cataracts (P =.001). There was no significant difference in flare between patients with and without keratic precipitates, optic disc edema, or glaucoma. No relationships were found between abnormalities or complications and the level of inflammatory cells or flare as determined by clinical assessment. We also identified an inverse relationship between flare and visual acuity that was not completely explained by the presence of complications in a stepwise regression model.
CONCLUSIONS: Although causal relationships were not established, associations between flare and some complications of uveitis suggest that aqueous humor protein may be an important factor in the development of these problems. Consequently, laser flare photometry could play a role in predicting outcomes or monitoring therapy for patients with uveitis.",10,2001-Dec-1

Herpes zoster ophthalmicus (HZO) is a common condition occurring mostly in healthy people. Approximately 50% of HZO patients develop ocular complications, with iridocyclitis occurring in about 43%. This study aimed to identify the clinical features of uveitis secondary to HZO.
METHOD: A retrospective case study was performed of consecutive patients with HZO and secondary uveitis seen in the past 10 years at the Royal Victorian Eye and Ear hospital as well as those seen in the private clinics of two ocular immunology consultants. The information collected included the time relationship between onset of rash and uveitis, duration and treatment of the uveitis, and rate and nature of ocular complications.
RESULTS: Thirty-four patients fulfilled the enrolment criteria. The age range was from 24 to 83 years with an average age of 62.5 years. Of these, 28 patients (82%) were immunocompetent and six patients (18%) had underlying immunosuppression from various causes. Twenty-three patients had a uniphasic episode of uveitis and 11 patients (32%) had a chronic relapsing course of uveitis. The duration of the uveitis was variable, ranging from 1 week to 3 years, with 68% of episodes resolving within 2 months. Nineteen patients (56%) developed secondary glaucoma. Five of these patients (26%) required trabeculectomies to control their intraocular pressures. Three patients (9%) had bilateral ocular involvement and five patients (15%) had a reduction in final Snellen visual acuity of more than two lines.
CONCLUSION: In this study, most patients were immunocompetent individuals. The course of the uveitis was generally uniphasic in nature and of a relatively short duration. There was a high incidence of secondary glaucoma with 15% of all patients requiring surgical intervention. The visual loss in the five patients was not directly related to the uveitis and secondary glaucoma but to other complications associated with HZO.",10,2001-Dec-1

To establish expert recommendations for the management of ocular sarcoidosis (OS).
METHODS: A question-based survey on the management of OS was circulated to international uveitis experts (members of the International Uveitis Study Group and the International Ocular Inflammation Society) electronically. Subsequently, a consensus workshop was conducted at the 7th International Workshop on Ocular Sarcoidosis (IWOS) in June 2019 in Sapporo, Japan as part of the Global Ocular Inflammation Workshops. Statements on the management of OS that were supported by a two-thirds majority of 10 international panel members of the workshop, after discussion and voting, were taken as consensus agreement.
RESULTS: A total of 98 participants from 29 countries responded to the questionnaire survey. The subsequent consensus workshop established recommendations for the management of OS in five sections. The first section concerned evaluation and monitoring of inflammation. The second, third and fourth sections described ocular manifestations that were indications for treatment, and the management of anterior uveitis, intermediate uveitis and posterior uveitis. In the fifth section, the use of systemic corticosteroids and systemic immunosuppressive drugs were detailed.
CONCLUSIONS: Recommendations for management of OS were formulated through an IWOS consensus workshop.",10,2021-Nov-1

To investigate the correlation between best-corrected visual acuity (BCVA), the foveal inner segment/outer segment (IS/OS) junction or ellipsoid portion of inner segment (EPIS/ellipsoid zone), and the cone outer segment tips (COST) line or interdigitation zone integrity in eyes with uveitic macular edema (ME).
METHOD: A retrospective observational study involving all patients from January 2012 to December 2013 with uveitic ME was performed. All patients underwent BCVA using Snellen charts spectral-domain optical coherence tomography (SD-OCT) examination using Spectralis OCT (Heidelberg Engineering, Heidelberg, Germany).
RESULTS: Fifty-two eyes from 45 patients were included in this study. Multivariate analysis showed a negative correlation between BCVA and the central retinal subfield thickness (CST), the cystoid pattern of edema, and the interdigitation zone interruption. Univariate logistic analysis showed a strong correlation between the ellipsoid zone and the interdigitation zone integrity.
CONCLUSIONS: The ellipsoid zone defect, the interdigitation zone interruption, and the CST are correlated with poor vision. Visual acuity is also strongly affected by the cystoid pattern. The interdigitation zone integrity appears to be the most important factor in the visual prognosis of uveitic ME.",10,2015-1-1

Uveitis is a sight-threatening eye inflammation and common manifestation of juvenile idiopathic arthritis (JIA). New biomarkers that can predict uveitis are needed to alleviate personalized clinical screening. In this review, we outline clinical and molecular risk factors for uveitis and discuss their putative biology and value for clinical practice. Areas covered: The recent discovery of the YST-amino acid motif in the Human Leukocyte Antigen DRB1 gene exposed a strong genetic predisposition for uveitis in females and can be used to identify low-risk cases and redefine screening policies. The established predictor 'young age at arthritis onset' appeared to only hold true for females, emphasizing the importance of sex-stratification in biomarker applications. Aqueous humor profiling studies have shown unique mediator changes. Finally, erythrocyte sedimentation rate and S100A12 levels can be used to stratify patients at high risk for uveitis. Expert commentary: Various markers have been identified and may significantly improve risk assessment for uveitis in JIA. However, there remains an unmet need to better predict uveitis in advance. Here, we propose a set of markers with high potential for prospective studies, which subsequently can be integrated to develop optimal prediction tools that complement improved screening guidelines for early disease detection and personalized care strategies.",10,2019-Jun-1

The aim of current study was to evaluate the incidence and characteristics of ocular sarcoidosis in a Korean population. We conducted a retrospective study of 104 consecutive patients with biopsy-proven sarcoidosis seen at Asan Medical Center in Seoul, Korea, from 1993 to 2007. Medical records, photographs, and fluorescein angiograms were reviewed. Of 104 patients, 22 (21%) had intraocular involvement with female predominance (86%, M:F=3:19). Of the 39 eyes with ocular involvement, 16 (41%) eyes had isolated anterior uveitis, 12 (31%) eyes had intermediate uveitis, 6 eyes (15%) had panuveitis with retinal vasculitis, and 5 (13%) eyes had panuveitis with punched multifocal choroiditis. Mean duration of ophthalmologic follow-up was 62 months. All ocular inflammation was well managed with topical steroid and/or systemic steroid with relatively good final visual outcomes. Ocular complications such as cataract (12 eyes, 30%), glaucoma (6 eyes, 15%), vitreous opacity (1 eye, 3%), cystoid macular edema (3 eyes, 7%), neovascularization (2 eye, 5%), and epiretinal membrane (4 eye, 10%) were related to ocular sarcoidosis.

To evaluate the demographics, aetiologies, complications, treatments and visual prognoses of chronic and recurrent non-infectious paediatric-onset uveitis in France.
METHODS: Descriptive, retrospective and bicentric study in patients whose disease started before 17 and who were followed up in two centres from January 2010 to May 2017.
RESULTS: We included 147 patients with 268 affected eyes. Eighty-two had juvenile idiopathic arthritis-associated chronic uveitis, 58 were antinuclear antibody (ANA) positive and 24 were ANA negative, 36 had idiopathic uveitis, 9 had enthesitis-related arthritis-associated uveitis, 9 had sarcoidosis-associated uveitis and 11 had other inflammatory aetiologies. These patients cumulated 161 complications: ocular hypertension, cataract, band keratopathy, macular oedema, optic disk oedema and decreased visual acuity, including permanent visual loss for 31 patients. The most used treatments were corticosteroid (CS) eye drops (82%), systemic CSs (34%), methotrexate (58%) and biologics (38%). At the latest follow-up, 45 patients had achieved remission of uveitis without any treatment, 56 had inactive uveitis on topical steroids and 48 still had active uveitis.
CONCLUSION: Paediatric-onset uveitis are associated with a high rate of complications. However, following the introduction of biologics and particularly antitumour necrosis factor alpha antibodies, a significant proportion of uveitis became inactive on or even off treatment.",10,2019-1-1

The diseases affecting the retina or uvea (iris, ciliary body, or choroid) generate changes in the biochemical or protein composition of ocular fluids/tissues due to disruption of blood-retinal barrier. Ocular infections and inflammations are sight-threatening diseases associated with various infectious and non-infectious etiologies. Several etiological entities cause uveitis, a complex intraocular inflammatory disease. These causes of uveitis differ in different populations due to geographical, racial, and socioeconomic variations. While clinical appearance is sufficiently diagnostic in many diseases, some of the uveitic entities manifest nonspecific or atypical clinical presentation. Identification of biomarkers in such diseases is an important aid in their diagnostic armamentarium. Different diseases and their different severity states release varying concentrations of proteins, which can serve as biomarkers. Proteomics is a high throughput technology and a powerful screening tool for serum biomarkers in various diseases that identifies proteins by mass spectrometry and helps to improve the understanding of pathogenesis of a disease. Proteins determine the biological state of a cell. Once identified as biomarkers, they serve as future diagnostic and pharmaceutical targets. With a potential to redirect the diagnosis of idiopathic uveitis, ocular proteomics provide a new insight into the pathophysiology and therapeutics of various ocular inflammatory diseases. Tears, aqueous and vitreous humor represent potential repositories for proteomic biomarkers discovery in uveitis. With an extensive proteomics work done on animal models of uveitis, various types of human uveitis are being subjected to proteome analysis for biomarker discovery in different ocular fluids (vitreous, aqueous, or tears).",10,2020-1-1

Uveitis is the most common, clinically apparent, extra-articular manifestation of axial spondyloarthritis. This review summarizes recent publications related to this form of uveitis.
RECENT FINDINGS: Studies published since the start of 2015 address the worldwide prevalence of human leukocyte antigen (HLA) B27-associated uveitis, the prevalence of axial spondyloarthritis among patients with B27-associated acute anterior uveitis (AAU), the genetics of AAU and some of the clinical implications of AAU. Progress has been made in the treatment of uveitis in general and in the treatment of uveitis in association with spondyloarthropathy in particular. The pathogenesis of AAU might derive clues from the above as well as from an understanding of the microbiome and possibly from knowledge derived from uveitis in association with Ebola.
SUMMARY: Although HLA B27-associated uveitis has been recognized since 1973, a variety of recent observations shed new light on this common clinical association with spondyloarthritis.",10,2017-Jul-1

Diagnostic vitrectomy is performed in cases of posterior segment inflammation that are suspicious for malignancy or infection and require tissue confirmation. Advances in vitrectomy technique and laboratory tests have improved the diagnostic yield in these challenging cases. The methods for obtaining vitreous specimens and the diagnostic tests used to analyze them are discussed.
RECENT FINDINGS: Ancillary tests have been invaluable in addressing the diagnostic limitations of traditional histopathologic and microbiologic analyses. Flow cytometry, gene rearrangement studies, and cytokine measurements are useful adjuncts to cytology for the diagnosis of malignancy, in particular primary intraocular lymphoma. Microbial DNA amplification by polymerase chain reaction and intraocular antibody measurement has been shown to detect the presence of infection by organisms that are difficult to culture.
SUMMARY: When performed appropriately, diagnostic vitrectomy with carefully selected ancillary testing can lead to a definitive diagnosis in a large proportion of cases.",10,2008-May-1

The purpose of this study is to describe the experience of Jules Gonin Eye Hospital on the long-term outcome of anti-TNF-alpha therapy in chronic non-infectious uveitis.
PATIENTS AND METHODS: We identified and followed those patients with chronic non-infectious uveitis who received systemic anti-TNF-alpha therapy. Anti-TNF-alpha therapy was administered when no response had been obtained with classical immunosuppressive therapies or in the presence of severe rheumatoid disease.
RESULTS: Fifteen patients (28 eyes), 7 male and 8 female (mean age, 43 years; range: 7 to 70 years) were identified. Diagnoses included HLA-B27-associated anterior uveitis (n = 4), sarcoidosis (n = 2), juvenile idiopathic arthritis (n = 2), idiopathic retinal vasculitis with uveitis (n = 2), pars planitis (n = 2), Adamantiades-Behçet disease (n = 1), birdshot retinochoroidopathy (n = 1), and Crohn's disease (n = 1). Mean duration of ocular disease was 8 years (range: 1 to 29 years). Treatment with infliximab (n = 11), etanercept (n = 2), or adalimumab (n = 2) was initiated. One patient with etanercept was switched to infliximab due to lack of clinical response. Clinical and angiographic regression of uveitis was observed within the first two months of therapy in all patients, and was maintained throughout the entire follow-up period (mean 18 months; range: 3 - 72 months). Recurrence was observed in 3 patients, and resolved after adjustment of therapy. Adverse events were recorded in only one patient (arterial hypotension).
CONCLUSIONS: In this series of patients with chronic non-infectious uveitis, anti-TNF-alpha therapy was effective and safe. Further clinical studies are needed to determine an adequate duration of therapy.",10,2008-May-1

Publication Date: 2015-Mar-1
PMID: 25611167
To summarize the multiple mechanisms responsible for angle closure in uveitis and to outline the management principles and treatment modalities.
RECENT FINDINGS: Angle closure in uveitis is a heterogeneous disease with multiple mechanisms. Recent advances in anterior segment imaging have provided insights into the mechanisms of angle closure in uveitis. Uveitic eyes with angle closure from pupil block require surgical iridectomy with mobilization of the peripheral iris and viscogoniosynechiolysis of both posterior synechiae and peripheral anterior synechiae. Systemic conditions associated with uveitis can result in anterior displacement of the iris-lens diaphragm, and present as acute angle closure. Pupil block is not the predominant mechanism in these eyes, and management is primarily medical. Data are limited on the optimal treatment of angle closure in uveitis, and the role of glaucoma filtration surgery, cataract extraction, minimally invasive glaucoma surgery and newer modalities of cycloablation require evaluation.
SUMMARY: The management of angle closure in uveitis should adhere to the principles of managing both uveitic glaucoma and angle closure. Identification of the mechanism of angle closure in uveitic eyes may enable treatment to be targeted at the responsible mechanism.",10,2015-Mar-1

To assess the frequency and characteristics of discrepant findings between fluorescein angiography (FA) and optical coherence tomography (OCT) in uveitic macular edema (ME).
DESIGN: Retrospective cross-sectional study of 112 eyes of 78 patients with uveitic ME on FA, OCT, or both.
METHODS: ME was graded on OCT and FA of uveitis patients attending the University Medical Center Utrecht. The frequency and severity of discrepant findings were analyzed, and the clinical findings at the time of imaging were assessed. The imaging studies were compared with the clinical characteristics.
RESULTS: Positive results of both imaging methods (FA+/OCT+) were observed in 61 (54%) of 112 eyes, whereas discrepant results occurred in 51 (46%) of 112 eyes. The FA+/OCT- discrepancy occurred in 34 (30%) of 112 eyes, and the FA-/OCT+ discrepancy occurred in 17 (15%) of 112 eyes. No correlations between the discrepant imaging results and age, gender, duration of uveitis or ME, visual acuity, or cause of uveitis were identified. FA+/OCT- and FA-/OCT+ discrepancies comprised typically mild degrees of ME. The FA+/OCT- discrepancy occurred in 50% of eyes with birdshot chorioretinopathy (7/14), and the FA-/OCT+ discrepancy occurred more often in intermediate uveitis than in other anatomic locations. Although the FA+/OCT+ consistency was noted frequently in active uveitis, the FA-/OCT+ discrepancy was common in eyes with inactive uveitis (8/18; 44% of inactive eyes).
CONCLUSIONS: Our results emphasize that FA and OCT are complementary investigations, each revealing different aspects of the pathophysiology of uveitic ME.",10,2012-Aug-1

Several epidemiologic studies report on the prevalence of Behçet's syndrome (BS) and demographic and clinical findings in patients from different countries and ethnicities. Although these studies point out geographic differences in disease course, methodologic differences make it difficult to compare the results of these studies. Recent data suggest that neutrophil extracellular trap levels are elevated in patients with BS, and that it may be a potential therapeutic target for the reduction or prevention of BS-associated thrombotic risk. Details on the mode of functioning of ERAP have been delineated and further epigenetic data reported. Wall thickness of lower extremity veins is increased among BS patients without any apparent clinical involvement. Magnetic resonance (MR) venography and Doppler ultrasonography (USG) were comparable in the diagnosis of chronic deep vein thrombosis, while MR venography is more effective in detecting collateral formations. Results were also collected on some dietary and non-dietary factors in triggering oral ulcers, while smoking seems to have a protective role. With regards to the therapy, it has been demonstrated that endovascular interventions carry the risk of inducing pathergy phenomenon. Apremilast has been convincingly shown to be useful for oral ulcers of BS and classical immunosuppressives are effective as first line therapy in more than half of patients with uveitis. While infliximab and adalimumab seem to be equally effective in the treatment of refractory uveitis of BS, the combination of adalimumab and immunosuppressives appears to be superior to immunosuppressives alone for venous thrombosis of the extremities. In addition, tocilizumab might be an alternative to anti-TNF agents for patients with arterial involvement refractory to immunosuppressives. On the other hand, the place of IL-17 inhibition in the treatment of BS still remains questionable.",10,2019-1-1

To ascertain the effectiveness, tolerability, and safety of low-dose cyclosporine in the management of sight-threatening uveitis.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: This was a retrospective clinical case series of patients using oral low-dose cyclosporine for the management of sight-threatening uveitis in the uvea clinic (UC). Patients receiving cyclosporine were identified from the clinic database. Main outcome measures were degree of intraocular inflammation, visual acuity and dose reduction of oral steroid for effectiveness and adverse symptoms, systemic hypertension, and raised serum creatinine for tolerability and safety.
RESULTS: Intraocular inflammation was improved or stable in 97% of patients, visual acuity was improved or stable in 91%, and oral steroid dosage was reduced in 73% (by half or more in 51%). Adverse symptoms were almost universal, the commonest being peripheral paresthesia/burning in 70% and fatigue in 67%. Significant systemic hypertension developed in 27% and raised creatinine in 30%, necessitating dose reduction. Cyclosporine was discontinued in 35%, being intolerable in 20% and ineffective in 15%.
CONCLUSIONS: Cyclosporine was found to be effective in reducing inflammation and protecting vision in sight-threatening uveitis. It was safe with proper monitoring, including in children. It had a significant toxicity profile and a high incidence of adverse symptoms which required close supervision, and a prompt dose reduction or drug exchange.",10,2010-1-1

We present the results of a double-blind trial comparing the efficacy of betamethasone phosphate 0.1%, clobetasone butyrate 0.1%, and placebo in the treatment of acute unilateral nongranulomatous uveitis. The 2 steroids were equally comparable in improvement of the patients' symptoms, though betamethasone phosphate was significantly more effective than clobetasone butyrate in improving the ocular signs of uveitis. However, clobetasone butyrate had significantly less effect on raising intraocular pressure in known steroid responders and ocular hypertensives than did dexamethasone. The use of a bolometer as an objective measure in uveitis was significant only in the more severe cases of uveitis. In comparing the placebo group of patients with those on topical steroids, the former group, though improving, appeared to lag behind by approximately one week. Four cases on placebo, however, had to be withdrawn because of worsening of the condition. Mild cases of anterior uveitis would probably resolve without using topical steroids.",10,1979-Nov-1

Antibodies to myelin oligodendrocyte glycoprotein (MOG) have been identified in both children and adults with demyelination, with a strong association with bilateral or recurrent optic neuritis (ON). However, the full clinical spectrum of this newly described condition is unknown. We sought to describe non-ON inflammatory ophthalmological presentations such as uveitis and optic perineuritis in the context of MOG antibody seropositivity.
METHODS: Using a live cell-based assay analysed by flow cytometry, we identified seropositive patients referred for MOG antibody testing in Australasia between 2014 and 2017. We identified four MOG antibody-positive patients with non-ON inflammatory ophthalmological presentations and present their detailed clinical information in this case series.
RESULTS: Three patients had uveitis either in association with, or remote from, ON. One patient had optic perineuritis and peripheral ulcerative keratitis. We describe the presentation, examination, investigation findings and clinical course of these four patients.
CONCLUSIONS: Recognition of these novel clinical associations may expand the clinical spectrum of MOG antibody-associated presentations. An expedited diagnosis may guide the management of these complex patients.",10,2019-Aug-1

The purpose of the current study was to analyze the binding patterns of serum autoantibodies from juvenile idiopathic arthritis (JIA) and JIA-associated uveitis (JIAU) patients to proteomes from different ocular tissues and to identify potential ocular autoantigens in JIAU. Proteomes from porcine iris, ciliary body, or retina tissue were isolated, separated using 2D-gel electrophoresis, and transferred to a blotting membrane. The binding pattern of serum antibodies from JIA or JIAU patients or healthy controls to ocular proteins was visualized by using anti-human IgG secondary antibodies and chemiluminescence reaction. Selected protein spots were excised from silver-stained 2D gels and subjected to mass spectrometry. Serum antibodies binding to ocular proteins were detected in all patient groups and healthy controls. Irrespective of the patient groups, serum antibodies bound to 49 different protein spots of the retina proteome, to 53 of the ciliary body proteome, and to 44 of the iris proteome. The relative binding frequency of sera to these iris protein spots was significantly higher in JIAU than in JIA patients or healthy controls. Particularly in JIAU patients, cluster analyses indicated a broad range of serum antibodies directed against ocular antigens, mostly in the iris proteome. Iris proteins frequently bound by serum antibodies in all groups were identified as tubulin beta chain, vimentin, ATP synthase subunit beta, actin, and L-lactate dehydrogenase B chain. Iris proteins exclusively bound by JIAU serum antibodies were heat shock cognate 71 kDa protein and keratin. Although serum autoantibody binding to ocular antigens was not disease-specific, a significant diversity of autoantibodies against a broad range of antigens, particularly from the iris tissue, was detected in JIAU patients. As the iris is a major site of inflammation in JIAU, the present data give further evidence that autoantibodies may be involved in JIAU immunopathology.",10,2019-1-1

Uveitis is the most severe complication of juvenile idiopathic arthritis (JIA). The diagnosis may be delayed, as visual symptoms are usually absent, which provides time for insidious complications. The course is chronic and long-term treatment is therefore required.
METHODS: We retrospectively reviewed the medical records of 75 children with uveitis who accounted for 10.5% of all patients with JIA seen at our pediatric rheumatology outpatient clinic between July 1997 and July 2007.
RESULTS: Uveitis occurred chiefly in patients with pauciarticular JIA. At last follow-up, in 69 patients in whom the files could be satisfactorily reviewed, only the anterior compartment was involved in 59.4% and both the anterior and the posterior compartments in the remainder. Mean age at the uveitis diagnosis was 4.5 years. In 9 (13.0%) patients, uveitis antedated joint manifestations; in 17 (24.7%) both were diagnosed simultaneously; and in 43 (62.3%) arthritis antedated uveitis. In 42 (61%) patients, complications occurred (synechiae, papillary block, cataract, hyalitis, papilledema, glaucoma, macular edema, elevated intraocular pressure, vision loss, and hypotonia). Topical medications were used in all patients for at least 3 months. Severe ocular involvement required systemic glucocorticoid therapy in 29 (42.0%) patients. Among immunomodulating agents, methotrexate and cyclosporine were used in 41 patients and TNFalpha antagonists in 15 patients. Surgery was performed in 21 (30.4%) patients. Uveitis completely resolved in 12 (17.4%) patients, a relapsing course occurred in 14 (20.3%), and became chronic with relapses as soon as the topical treatment was decreased in 23 (33.3%). A severe course was observed in 21 (30.4%) patients of whom 3 became blind and 4 lost vision in one eye.
CONCLUSION: Uveitis is a severe complication of JIA. Patients with JIA should receive routine ophthalmological follow-up at regular intervals, even is their joint disease is quiescent.",10,2009-Jul-1

To determine the clinical features and distribution of uveitis in the pediatric age group at a referral eye care center in Shiraz, South Iran.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: All new cases of uveitis in patients 18-year-old or younger referred from January 2007 to December 2013 were enrolled in this study. The patient underwent a complete history of systemic and ocular diseases, comprehensive ophthalmic examination. Patients were classified according to the International Uveitis Study Group definitions. The definitive diagnosis was based on clinical manifestations and laboratory investigations.
RESULTS: Seventy-seven eyes (54 patients) comprised the study sample. The mean age at the onset of uveitis was 12.5 years. The female-to-male ratio was 1.25. Anterior uveitis was the most frequent anatomical location (40.7%), followed by intermediate uveitis (33.3%), posterior uveitis (18.5%), and panuveitis (7.5%). Seventy-four percent of patients presented with chronic uveitis. Noninfectious uveitis (81.5%) was the most frequent etiology. Thirty-seven percent of patients had a specific diagnosis for uveitis, and 63% were classified as idiopathic cases. Toxocariasis was the most common infectious cause. Associated systemic diseases were present in 14.8% of patients. The most frequent systemic disease was juvenile idiopathic arthritis in 9.2% of patients. Complications occurred in 66 (85.5%) of affected eyes. The most common complications were posterior synechia (20.7%), cataract (18.8%), and cystoid macular edema (12.9%).
CONCLUSIONS: Uveitis in the majority of children had an insidious onset and was chronic. Over half the patients had a specific diagnosis. Idiopathic cases were more common in the intermediate uveitis group.",10,2016-1-1

Retinal pigment epithelium (RPE) builds the outer blood-retinal barrier of the eye and plays an important role in pathogenesis of the sight threatening disease equine recurrent uveitis (ERU). ERU is a spontaneous autoimmune mediated inflammatory disease characterised by the breakdown of the outer blood-retinal barrier and an influx of autoaggressive T-cells into the inner eye. Therefore, identification of molecular mechanisms contributing to changed function of blood-retinal barrier in ERU is important for the understanding of pathophysiology. Cell surface proteins of RPE collected from healthy horses and horses with ERU were captured by in situ biotinylation and analysed with high resolution mass spectrometry coupled to liquid chromatography (LC-MS/MS) to identify differentially expressed proteins. With label free differential proteomics, a total of 27 differently expressed cell surface proteins in diseased RPE could be detected. Significant down-regulation of three very interesting proteins, synaptotagmin 1, basigin and collectrin was verified and further characterised.
BIOLOGICAL SIGNIFICANCE: We applied an innovative and successful method to detect changes in the plasma cell surface proteome of RPE cells in a spontaneous inflammatory eye disease, serving as a valuable model for human autoimmune uveitis. We were able to identify 27 differentially expressed plasma cell membrane proteins, including synaptotagmin 1, basigin and collectrin, which play important roles in cell adhesion, transport and cell communication.",10,2014-Sep-23

Recently, human retinal pigment epithelial (RPE) cells have been demonstrated to express class II, HLA-DR, antigens both in vivo and in vitro. HLA-DR antigens were detected on RPE cells from patients with uveitis and retinitis pigmentosa. In addition, in vitro studies revealed that not only does this cell express HLA-DR antigen but also that this antigen can be modulated by the lymphokine, interferon (IFN)-gamma. In this study we evaluated the development of the murine class II, Ia, antigens on RPE cells in experimental autoimmune uveoretinitis (EAU). Ia antigen was evaluated with the avidin-biotin-peroxidase technique. Ia antigen was not detected on RPE cells from normal rats. However, Ia antigen was detected on the surface of RPE cells from EAU rats four days prior to the development of clinical and histopathological EAU. Moreover, the expression of Ia antigen on RPE cells from EAU rats continued to persist until one and one-half months after immunization. This study demonstrates that during the course of EAU the RPE cell is activated to express Ia antigens. This antigen expression may be important in the initiation and/or perpetuation of immune reactivity in the eye.",10,1986-Apr-1

Behçet's disease (BD) is a systemic inflammatory disease characterized by recurrent oral ulcers, genital ulcers, cutaneous inflammation, and uveitis. In addition, other potentially life-threatening lesions may occur in the intestinal tract, blood vessels, and central nervous system. This heterogeneity of the BD phenotype hampers development of a targeted treatment strategy. The pathogenesis of BD is not fully elucidated, but it is likely that genetically susceptible people develop BD in response to environmental factors, such as microbiome factors. Genetic analyses have identified various BD susceptibility loci that function in HLA-antigen presentation pathways, Th1 and Th17 cells, and autoinflammation related to monocytes/macrophages, or that increase levels of pro-inflammatory cytokines, reduce levels of anti-inflammatory cytokines, or act in dysfunctional mucous barriers. Our functional analyses have revealed that impairment of M2 monocyte/macrophage-mediated anti-inflammatory function through IL-10 is crucial to BD pathogenesis. We, therefore, propose that BD is an M1-dominant disease. In this review, we describe the roles of monocytes and macrophages in BD and consider the potential of these cells as therapeutic targets.",10,2022-1-1

The purpose of this study was to test whether gene copy number variations (CNVs) of Toll-like receptors (TLRs) are associated with uveitis.
METHODS: Copy number variations of TLRs were detected by real-time PCR. The first stage of the study consisted of enrolling 400 Behçet's disease (BD) patients, 400 Vogt-Koyanagi-Harada syndrome patients, 400 patients with acute anterior uveitis associated with or without ankylosing spondylitis, and 600 healthy subjects. The second stage included another set of 578 BD patients and 1000 healthy controls. The frequencies of TLR gene copy number types (TLR1, TLR2, TLR3, TLR5, TLR6, TLR7, TLR9, TLR10) were compared among patients and controls by using the χ(2) test. Real-time PCR was used to detect mRNA expression from peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) obtained from healthy controls following stimulation with the TLR7 agonist R848. Levels of TNF-α, IL-6, IL-1β, and IFN-β in culture supernatants were measured by ELISA.
RESULTS: All TLRs tested, except for TLR7, had a gene copy number of two in more than 98% of individuals tested. In the first stage, we found a significantly increased frequency of more than one copy of TLR7 (located on the X chromosome) in male BD patients and more than two copies in female patients (correction of P value [PC] = 0.021; PC = 0.048, respectively). A second stage and combined study confirmed the association (PC = 1.14 × 10(-6); PC = 9.12 × 10(-5), respectively). TLR7 mRNA expression in PBMCs was increased in healthy male carriers having more than one copy of TLR7 or females having more than two copies following stimulation with R848 (P = 0.021, P = 0.006, respectively). No effect of the various TLR7 copies on the release of TNF-α, IL-6, IL-1β, and IFN-β could be detected.
CONCLUSIONS: This study provides evidence that a high copy number of TLR7 confers risk for BD in a Chinese Han population. (http://www.chictr.org number, ChiCTR-CCC-12002184.).",10,2015-Feb-03

Immunoglobulin G (IgG) in aqueous humor from patients with various uveitis syndromes was analyzed using a number of immunologic techniques. Sixty-five percent of patients with Fuchs' heterochromic cyclitis (FHC), 70% of patients with other forms of uveitis, and 44% of controls showed local synthesis of IgG, as demonstrated by an elevated IgG:albumin relative concentration ratio. Using an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay to measure the concentration of IgG subclasses 1-4, a relative excess of IgG1 was found in the aqueous compared with the serum in FHC. Isoelectric focusing and immunoblotting studies revealed oligoclonal IgG bands in the aqueous of 13 of 23 (57%) patients with FHC, most being of the IgG1 subclass. Oligoclonal bands were not found in 18 patients with other types of uveitis or 13 patients undergoing surgery for senile cataract. These findings indicate intraocular production of IgG of restricted specificity in FHC, providing further evidence for local immune dysfunction in this condition. As yet the antigenic stimulus for this oligoclonal B-cell response has not been identified.",10,1990-Oct-1

The gut microbiome has important physiological functions and plays an indispensable role in the human body. Currently, there are an increasing number of studies revealing the close correlation between dysbiosis of the gut microbiome and a variety of autoimmune diseases, including autoimmune uveitis. This brief review summarizes recent literature regarding the relationship between dysbiosis and the occurrence and development of autoimmune uveitis. Dysbiosis participates in the pathogenesis of autoimmune uveitis largely by 4 mechanisms: antigenic mimicry, disturbance of intestinal immune homeostasis, destruction of the intestinal barrier, and reduction of beneficial anti-inflammatory metabolites. Further elucidation of these mechanisms will facilitate the treatment of the gut-microbiome-relevant autoimmune diseases by potential therapeutic strategies, such as antibiotics, probiotics, diet modifications, and fecal microbial transplantation.",10,2021-1-1

To assess the efficacy of anti-TNF alpha (TNF-α) therapy in patients with non-infectious uveitis.
METHODS: This was a monocentric observational study of 21 patients with non-infectious uveitis treated with anti-TNF-alpha. The primary endpoint was the control of ocular inflammation. The secondary endpoints included the study of macular thickness and visual acuity, changes in other treatments, and adverse effects.
RESULTS: The etiologies of uveitis were Behçet disease (33.3%), birdshot (14.3%), sarcoidosis (9.5%), and idiopathic uveitis (42.9%). Ocular inflammation was controlled at 3 months for 80.9% of patients, at 6 months for 94.7%, at 12 months for 83.3%, and at >12 months for 86.7%. Central macular thickness improved from 452 µm at baseline to 307.5 µm at 12 months (p = 0.002). Visual acuity also improved from 0.51(logMAR) before treatment to 0.24 at 12 months. The mean daily dose of prednisone decreased from 19.7 mg before treatment to 5.2 mg at 12 months (p < 0.001). A total of 9.5% of patients experienced serious side-effects.
CONCLUSIONS: Our study confirms the efficacy of anti-TNF for the control of short-term and long-term ocular inflammation, with high rates of complete clinical remission.",10,2018-1-1

Although eye diseases are considered to be relatively less affected by patient sex, it is noteworthy that the presence of hormone receptors have been confirmed in various ocular tissues, which were considered to have few sex-based differences. Female hormone levels are known to change because of menstruation, pregnancy, and menopause. When female hormone levels markedly fluctuate in such situations, the disease state may change.The fluctuations in the levels of sex hormones affect the corneal thickness conditions of uveitis.Estrogen may be a possible therapeutic option for glaucoma because it protects the eyes from damage caused by glaucoma and reduces intraocular pressure;it is particularly promising in the treatment of postmenopausal women with glaucoma.Estrogen is considered to have a prophylactic effect against eye diseases. However, there is a report that female sex is an independent risk factor for the progression of diabetic retinopathy, so it may not always exert a prophylactic effect. Thus, caution should be exercised.Based on recent progression of studies on this field, the importance of treatment according to gender has been recognized in the treatment of eye diseases.",10,2019-Aug-30

Intraocular inflammation (uveitis) was produced in rabbits by intravenous or subcutaneous treatment with N-acetylmuramyl-L-alanyl-D-isoglutamine and several of its synthetic analogs at doses of greater than or equal to 0.2 mg/kg in saline. A dose-dependent increase in permeability of the ocular blood-aqueous barrier as measured by leakage of protein or fluoresceinated dextran from the serum into the eye was observed from 2 to 14 h after glycopeptide treatment. Peak response occurred at approximately 3 h postdose. The lowest dose found to produce maximal vascular leakage for the most active glycopeptide analogs was 1 mg/kg. The adjuvant-inactive L-L stereoisomer of N-acetylmuramyl-L-alanyl-D-isoglutamine was inactive, even at doses as high as 10 mg/kg. Analogs of N-acetylmuramyl-L-alanyl-D-isoglutamine which were homologous in the lactyl side chain were found to cause less uveitis. Chronic biweekly intravenous treatment of rabbits for 1 month with either N-acetyl-L-alpha-aminobutyryl-D-isoglutamine or its lipophilic 6-O-stearoyl derivative at 1 mg/kg, but not with murabutide, resulted in leukocytic inflammatory lesions unique to the uveal tract of the eye. The uveitis was potentially reversible and occurred with decreased severity as long as 2 months after cessation of chronic treatment. Vascular leakage but not cellular infiltrate in the choroid could be modulated by pharmacologic means. Pyrogenicity but not adjuvanticity correlated with ability of glycopeptides to induce vascular leakage. Several adjuvant-active muramyl dipeptide analogs with minimal ability to cause acute vascular leakage or chronic inflammation in the rabbit eye have been identified.",10,1986-Mar-1

To compare the efficacy of Adalimumab (ADA) in noninfectious anterior uveitis (AU) and posterior segment (PS) involvement, associated with different conditions, with a focus on Behçet's syndrome (BS).
METHODS: In this retrospective, multicenter post-hoc study, we evaluated the efficacy of ADA in terms of ocular control and relapses in 96 patients with AU and PS uveitis, either idiopathic (IU) or associated with BS or with other systemic disorders (OSD) (Juvenile Idiopathic Arthritis, Psoriatic Arthritis, Ankylosing Spondylitis, Vogt-Koyanagi-Harada, Inflammatory Bowel Disease), followed in three tertiary referral centers.
RESULTS: Ninety-six patients (45 AU; 51 PS uveitis) were included. Eleven had IU, 58 BS, and 27 OSD. All patients with AU achieved complete long-term ocular control. In PS uveitis, 89%, 67% and 100% of patients with BS, IU and OSD achieved ocular control at the last follow-up (> 12 months), respectively. The lowest ocular relapse rate occurred in patients with AU with BS (1/13) or IU (0/2). ADA accounted for long-term disease control, and no predictors of ocular control and relapse were identified; particularly, ocular relapses seemed not related to systemic ones. Macular edema resolved in 75% and 67% of PS uveitis with BS and IU, respectively.
CONCLUSIONS: ADA controls both anterior and posterior uveitis, with an efficacy similar in IU, BS and OSD patients. In BS, the efficacy of ADA seems to be independent of demographic and clinical characteristics, and ocular relapses mostly occurred independently from systemic ones. Based on our results, ADA may represent a valid alternative in anterior refractory uveitis.",10,2020-Jun-1

To define predictors for the 2-year outcome in terms of achieving inactivity, subsequent uveitis reactivation and occurrence of uveitis-related complications of JIA-associated uveitis.
METHODS: Demographic and clinical parameters and serum samples of JIA-associated uveitis patients enrolled in ICON at ⩽1 year of JIA diagnosis were collected at study enrolment, every 3 months during the first year and subsequently every 6 months. Predictors for the 2-year outcome were evaluated by linear mixed models.
RESULTS: Of 954 JIA patients included, uveitis occurred in 106 up to the first 2-year follow-up, with 98 of them having complete ophthalmological documentation. In 81.8% and 80.0% of patients, uveitis inactivity was achieved at the 1- and 2-year follow-up after uveitis onset, respectively. JIA onset after the age of 5 years, no use of topical corticosteroids, and adalimumab treatment were significantly associated with an inactive uveitis for at least 6 months (n = 57). Correlates for subsequent uveitis reactivation (n = 16, 30.2%) were age at uveitis onset ⩽5 years and active disease (clinical Juvenile Arthritis Disease Activity Score >4.5). Uveitis-related complications were present in 29.8% of patients at first uveitis documentation and in 30.7% and 32.8% at 1- and 2-year follow-up, respectively. Older age at JIA onset, short duration between JIA and uveitis onset, high anterior chamber (AC) cell grades, poor visual acuity, and topical steroid use at first uveitis documentation correlated with uveitis-related complications.
CONCLUSION: In addition to demographic risk factors, JIA disease and uveitis activity scores and adalimumab are significant predictors for the 2-year outcome of JIA-associated uveitis patients.",10,2019-Jun-01

Toll-like receptor 4 (TLR4) signal activation of macrophages can lead to endotoxin-induced uveitis (EIU). Previously, our research group has demonstrated a higher expression of TLR4 in vivo during EIU than normal. In this study, we analyzed levels of peritoneal macrophage cytokines from C3H/HeN mice with LPS stimulation in vitro to elucidate the effect of TLR4 on cytokines during EIU.",10,2012-1-1

Glaucoma is a disease process characterized by progressive optic nerve damage and corresponding visual field loss. It may be further categorized into either primary open-angle glaucoma or secondary glaucoma. These secondary glaucomas include glaucomas associated with uveitis and inflammation. Prostaglandin analogs (PGA) have been used to help lower intraocular pressure (IOP) in these often difficult to manage eyes. However, controversy exists concerning their use in uveitic patients due to the theoretically higher risk of anterior uveitis, development of cystoid macular edema (CME), and reactivation of herpes simplex keratitis (HSK). There is little evidence that PGA disrupt the blood-aqueous barrier and only anecdotal evidence suggesting an increased risk of these rare findings. PGA may be used in uveitic glaucoma when other topical treatments have not lowered IOP to the patient's target range.",10,2011-1-1

Sarcoidosis is a disease initiated by one or more unknown antigens in predisposed hosts, and causes noncaseating granulomatous inflammation. Uveitis is common and may affect any part of the eye. Protean systemic manifestations occur but pulmonary and cutaneous involvement is most common. Diagnosis is important; any suspicious uveitis should be investigated by relevant hematologic, radiologic, and invasive tests. A high proportion of patients require systemic corticosteroid or immunosuppressive treatment for uveitis. A significant minority become visually disabled because of macular scarring, glaucoma, or chorioretinal ischemia.",10,2002-Sep-1

Infectious uveitis accounts for majority of the cases of uveitis in developing countries. It also encompasses an array of various microorganisms and their clinical presentations. Some of these infectious uveitic entities are familiar, while others are newly emerging in the global ophthalmic world. Many of these entities are also a major cause of morbidity and mortality, and appropriate, timely management is required to save not the eye, but life of the patient. This review highlights the ocular manifestations of various infectious uveitic entities, relevant to the ophthalmologist.",10,2017-1-1

To characterize the clinical features of sympathetic ophthalmia (SO) and compare SO and Vogt-Koyanagi-Harada (VKH) disease in Chinese patients.
DESIGN: Retrospective case series.
PARTICIPANTS: A total of 131 consecutive SO and 500 VKH disease patients randomly selected from among those referred to our uveitis center from April 2008 through June 2018.
METHODS: History, extraocular and ocular findings, best-corrected visual acuity (BCVA), auxiliary examination findings, complications, and therapeutic effects were analyzed retrospectively in SO and VKH disease patients.
MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Visual outcome, extraocular and ocular findings, and therapeutic effects.
RESULTS: Sympathetic ophthalmia manifested as posterior uveitis (68.8%) within 2 weeks and equal involvement of anterior and posterior segment (44.4%), respectively, was observed between 2 weeks and 2 months after disease onset. Two months after disease onset, SO patients showed sunset glow fundus (51.2%) and granulomatous anterior uveitis (27.3%). Vogt-Koyanagi-Harada disease patients mainly showed posterior uveitis (100%), anterior segment involvement (92.4%) associated with posterior uveitis (84.9%), and granulomatous anterior uveitis (97.4%) accompanying sunset glow fundus (91.5%) in the 3 periods mentioned above. The frequencies of extraocular manifestations were lower in SO patients (24.4%) as compared with VKH disease patients (84.8%; P < 0.001). Best-corrected visual acuity of SO patients improved from 0.68±0.86 logarithm of the minimum angle of resolution (logMAR) to 0.47±0.78 logMAR (P = 0.01), and BCVA of VKH disease patients improved from 0.67±0.79 logMAR to 0.24±0.53 logMAR (P < 0.001) at 12 months of follow-up. A worse BCVA was noted in SO patients compared with VKH disease patients after treatment (P = 0.003). Kaplan-Meier survival analysis showed that the risk of loss of useful vision in SO patients was significantly higher than that of VKH disease patients (P < 0.001).
CONCLUSIONS: Chinese SO and VKH disease patients have a different evolutionary process. The frequency of extraocular manifestations in SO patients is much lower as compared with VKH disease patients. Visual outcome is worse in SO as compared with VKH disease.",10,2019-Sep-1

To evaluate the consequences of mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK)-mediated signaling in retinas with endotoxin-induced uveitis (EIU).
METHODS: EIU was induced with footpad inoculation of lipopolysaccharide (LPS). To identify the expression and activity of extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK), c-Jun NH2-terminal kinase (JNK), and p38, Western blot analysis and immunohistochemistry (IHC) were performed using antibodies against these kinases and phosphorylated forms. To evaluate the ERK mRNA expression level, semiquantitative reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) was performed. To identify cell species that express phosphorylated (p)-ERK, simultaneous demonstration of p-ERK and glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP) was performed with combined IHC and in situ hybridization. Dexamethasone (Dex) was used to reduce the LPS-induced inflammatory stimulus, and changes in p-ERK expression were evaluated by Western blot analysis after treatment.
RESULTS: Only p-ERK among the phosphorylated MAPKs increased after LPS stimulation, according to Western blot analysis. p-ERK increased after LPS injection, whereas both the Western blot and RT-PCR studies showed no apparent changes in ERK-1 and -2 expression. IHC revealed that strong p-ERK-positive staining initially appeared in the Müller cell bodies. Thereafter p-ERK immunostaining was also observed transiently in the radial processes of the Müller cells. The double-labeling study revealed that almost all Müller cells were positive for GFAP and p-ERK. Dex treatment substantially reduced expression of p-ERK, beginning 12 hours after treatment.
CONCLUSIONS: The present study suggests that LPS stimulation activates ERK in Müller cells, whereas the total amount of ERK is unchanged. Because the LPS-induced p-ERK level was reduced by Dex treatment, its expression seems to be associated with ocular inflammatory stimulus. Because the inflammatory stimulus elicited in EIU upregulated ERK activity in Müller cells, activated Müller cells may play a crucial role in protecting retinal cells from such inflammation.",10,2002-Apr-1

This study evaluated the risk and risk factors for exudative retinal detachment (ERD) in ocular inflammatory diseases.
DESIGN: Retrospective cohort study.
METHODS: Patients with noninfectious ocular inflammation had been followed longitudinally between 1978 and 2007 at 4 US subspecialty uveitis centers. The main outcome measurements were occurrences of ERD and predictive factors.
RESULTS: A total of 176 of 14,612 eyes with ocular inflammation presented with ERD. Among uveitis cases, Vogt-Koyanagi-Harada syndrome (VKH) (odds ratio [OR] = 109), undifferentiated choroiditis (OR = 9.18), sympathetic ophthalmia (OR = 8.43), primary or secondary panuveitis (OR = 7.09), multifocal choroiditis with panuveitis (OR = 4.51), and ""other"" forms of posterior uveitis (OR = 16.9) were associated with a higher prevalence of ERD. Among the 9,209 uveitic or scleritic eyes initially free of ERD and followed, 137 incident ERD cases were observed over 28,949 eye-years at risk (incidence rate = 0.47% [0.40%-0.56%/eye-year]). VKH (HR = 13.2), sympathetic ophthalmia (HR = 5.82), undifferentiated choroiditis (HR = 6.03), primary or secondary panuveitis (HR = 4.21), and rheumatoid arthritis (HR = 3.30) were significantly associated with incident ERD. A significant dose-response relationship with the prevalence and incidence of ERD were observed for AC cells and vitreous cell activity. African Americans had significantly higher prevalence and incidence of ERD.
CONCLUSIONS: Other ocular inflammatory conditions in addition to VKH syndrome and posterior scleritis were associated with increased risk of ERD, indicating that ERD does not necessarily dictate a diagnosis of VKH or posterior scleritis. In addition, the relationship between ERD and inflammatory severity factors implies that inflammation is a key predictive factor associated with developing ERD and requires early and vigorous control.",10,2020-Oct-1

We previously demonstrated the increased provirus load in the peripheral blood of patients with human T-cell leukemia virus type 1 (HTLV-1) uveitis (HU). To delineate the relevance of the increased provirus load to clinical and immunologic parameters, we studied the correlation between them. Seventy-nine HU patients (24 male and 55 female) were included in the study, with their informed consent. Plasma samples and genomic DNA of the peripheral blood mononuclear cells were isolated and the provirus load was estimated by semi-quantitative polymerase chain reaction of the gag region sequence. Serum levels of anti-HTLV-1 antibodies and soluble IL-2R were determined by electrochemiluminescence immuno assay and by ELISA, respectively. Disease activities were assessed and graded 0 to 4 according to the evaluation system. Recurrence of the disease during the follow-up period was diagnosed ophthalmologically. The provirus load was significantly higher in the HU patients after Graves' disease (GD) than in those without GD (P<0.05). It correlated with disease activities assessed in terms of vitreous inflammation and interval to recurrence (both P<0.05). In the HU patients without GD, it correlated with the serum levels of soluble IL-2 receptor (P<0.01), and nearly with those of HTLV-1 antibody (P=0.063). These correlations were not found in the HU patients after GD under methimazole treatment. The results suggested a direct involvement of HTLV-1-infected cells in the pathogenesis of uveitis, and raise the possibility that hyperthyroidism may contribute to the clonal expansion of HTLV-1-infected cells.",10,1998-Jun-1

To describe the features of Behçet-associated uveitis over a 25-year period.
DESIGN: Retrospective observational case series.
METHODS: A chart review of patients with Behçet-associated uveitis who were evaluated from January 1986 to December 2011 at King Khaled Eye Specialist Hospital, Saudi Arabia. Demographic data, symptoms, type of uveitis, treatment, and complications were evaluated. The main outcome measures were presenting symptoms, types of uveitis, treatment, and complications.
RESULTS: There were 132 patients (232 eyes; 102 male [77.3%]) evaluated with age of onset of 36.9 ± 11.4 years. Panuveitis was the most common presentation, affecting 118 patients (89.4%). Episodes were bilateral in 100 patients (75.8%). Baseline best-corrected visual acuity (BCVA) was 20/125 in both eyes. Retinal vasculitis at presentation occurred in 61 eyes (26.3%), occlusive vasculitis in 59 eyes (25.4%), and macular edema in 42 eyes (18.1%). Common therapeutic management included oral corticosteroids in 123 patients (93.2%), intravenous steroid therapy in 35 patients (26.5%), cyclosporine in 98 patients (74.2%), and azathioprine in 65 patients (49.2%). Common anterior segment complications included glaucoma (44 eyes, 19%) and cataracts (34 eyes, 14.7%). The most common posterior segment complication was optic nerve atrophy. Cataract surgery was the most common surgery. At last visit, BCVA was better than 20/50 in 131 eyes (56.5%).
CONCLUSIONS: Behçet-associated uveitis predominantly affects young men in Saudi Arabia. Bilateral panuveitis associated with retinal vasculitis was the most common manifestation. More than 50% of patients maintained 20/50 or better BCVA at final follow-up and were primarily managed with oral corticosteroids and other immunosuppressive agents.",10,2015-Jan-1

To study the immunopathology of experimental melanin-protein-induced uveitis in the Lewis rat.
METHODS: Rats were immunized with bovine ocular melanin protein. The kinetics of experimental melanin-protein-induced uveitis was studied by clinical examination and immunopathology. Cellular and humoral responses were evaluated by lymphocyte proliferation, delayed-type hypersensitivity, and agglutination. After clinical disease subsided, recurrent experimental uveitis was induced with a low-dose footpad injection of lipopolysaccharide.
RESULTS: Experimental melanin-protein-induced uveitis was characterized by bilateral uveal infiltration mainly with lymphocytes and monocytes. Delayed-type hypersensitivity, lymphocyte proliferation, and agglutination to bovine ocular melanin protein were positive. Expressions of major histocompatibility complex class II and intercellular adhesion molecule-1 were observed before ocular infiltration. The predominantly infiltrating cells were CD4+ lymphocytes. Experimental melanin-protein-induced uveitis subsided within 1 month, spontaneously recurred within 1 week in approximately one quarter of the rats, and was inducible in most rats with 5 micrograms of lipopolysaccharide confirmed by histopathology.
CONCLUSIONS: Experimental melanin-protein-induced uveitis is a T-cell-mediated autoimmune uveitis, resembling noninfectious recurrent iridocyclitis and choroiditis in humans.",10,1994-Jul-1

Ophthalmic and clinical analysis were carried out on 16 children and 122 adult patients affected by Behçet's disease (BD) to delineate the clinical features of BD in childhood and to investigate the differences between the expression of the disease in children and adults. The mean follow-up period was 7.8 and 7 years, respectively. Pediatric onset of BD was found in 7.6% of all the cases with a male:female ratio of 1.29:1. The complete type of the disease was observed in 50% of the children. No statistical significant differences were noted between children and adults in the incidence of oral aphthae, genital ulcers, skin lesions, arthritis, gastrointestinal involvement, neuropsychiatric symptoms and the presence of HLA-B51. Thrombophlebitis was associated with the onset of the disease in adult age (P=0.022). Uveitis alone or in combination with other major symptoms was the presenting sign in a higher percentage of children (P=0.077), As in adults, in children diffuse uveitis was the most common type of ocular inflammation, while ocular complications have been found mainly in children (P=0.021), who more frequently developed cataract, maculopathy and retinal detachment (P=0.024). Both adult and young male patients have shown a lower age at onset and higher rate of optic atrophy than females. In conclusion, no significant differences have been found between children and adults in the expression of the major and most of the minor symptoms of BD. Ocular involvement in childhood may be very severe, as was confirmed by the high frequency of diffuse uveitis and ocular complications. Young males, as adult males, showed an earlier onset of the disease and a worse ocular prognosis.",10,1995-1-1

Chronic health conditions in children can have a significant impact on their quality of life. The aim of this study was to explore the subjective experience of children and young people being treated for chronic, non-infectious uveitis associated with a systemic disease such as juvenile idiopathic arthritis.
METHODS: A semi-structured interview was conducted with 10 children and young people aged between 6 and 18 years of age and their parents.
RESULTS: Preliminary thematic analysis indicated that both the treatment and complications of the disorder have a significant impact on the quality of life and emotional well-being of patients, not only in terms of the discomfort experienced but also in perceptions of social isolation, anxiety and sense of injustice.
CONCLUSION: This study shows that themes including ""impact on school"", ""social factors"" and ""emotional reactions"" are important domains influencing health-related quality of life (HRQoL) in children with chronic uveitis. Inclusion of questions relating to these domains should be considered in future uveitis-specific tools examining HRQoL in these patients.",10,2017-Aug-04

MicroRNAs (miRNAs) are noncoding RNAs and have attracted attention as a biomarker in a variety of diseases. However, extensive unbiased miRNAs analysis in patients with uveitis has not been completely explored. In the present study, we comprehensively analyzed the deregulated miRNAs in three major forms of uveitis (Behҫet's disease [BD], sarcoidosis and Vogt-Koyanagi-Harada disease [VKH]) to search for potential biomarkers.
METHODS: This study included 10 patients with BD, 17 patients with sarcoidosis, and 13 patients with VKH. Eleven healthy subjects were used as controls. The miRNAs expression levels were studied by microarray using serum samples from patients with uveitis and healthy controls.
RESULTS: A total of 281 upregulated miRNAs and 137 downregulated miRNAs were detected in patients with BD, 35 upregulated miRNAs and 86 downregulated miRNAs in patients with sarcoidosis, and 153 upregulated miRNAs and 35 downregulated miRNAs in patients with VKH. Some deregulated miRNAs were involved in the mitogen-activated protein kinase signaling pathway and inflammatory cytokine pathways. Furthermore, we identified miR-4708-3p, miR-4323, and let-7g-3p as the best predictor miRNAs for BD, sarcoidosis, and VKH, respectively. Panels of miRNAs with diagnostic potential for the three diseases were generated using machine learning.
CONCLUSIONS: In this study, comprehensive miRNA analysis identified deregulated miRNAs in three major forms of noninfectious uveitis. This study provides new insights into molecular pathogenetic mechanisms and useful information toward developing novel diagnostic biomarkers and therapeutic targets for BD, sarcoidosis, and VKH.",10,2020-Sep-01

In the absence of prophylactic anti-inflammatory therapy, anterior chamber inflammation (characterized by cells and less commonly flare) is minimal and transient after selective laser trabeculoplasty in Afro-Caribbean glaucoma patients.
PURPOSE: The purpose of this study was to characterize the prevalence, severity, and duration of anterior chamber inflammation (cells and flare) following selective laser trabeculoplasty (SLT) in Afro-Caribbean eyes with primary open-angle glaucoma (POAG).
METHODS: In total 144 eyes of 72 POAG patients underwent first-time 360-degree SLT treatment following washout of all topical medications in the prospective West Indies Glaucoma Laser Study. No anti-inflammatory therapy was used post-SLT. Anterior chamber cells and flare were characterized pre-SLT after medication washout, and 1 week, 6 weeks, and 3, 6, 9 and 12 months post-SLT using the standardized methodology described by the Society for Uveitis Nomenclature (SUN) in which cells and flare are each graded on a scale of 0-4+ using specific slit-lamp settings.
RESULTS: Mean cell scores in both right and left eyes rose significantly (P<0.0001) from baseline to week 1 after SLT before returning to baseline values at all subsequent time points. Mean flare scores in right eyes (P=0.0185) but not left eyes (P=0.1816) rose from baseline to week 1 after SLT before returning to baseline values at all subsequent time points. Cells appeared in 40.3% of eyes and flare appeared in 9.7% of eyes after SLT. One subject developed bilateral symptomatic anterior iritis one day postoperatively and reported a previously undisclosed history of recurrent iritis; the iritis resolved with topical steroid therapy.
CONCLUSIONS: SLT in Afro-Caribbean people with POAG is associated with mild, short-lived and self-limited anterior chamber inflammation. Routine anti-inflammatory therapy to suppress posttreatment inflammation after SLT is unnecessary in this population.",10,2019-Jul-1

Behçet's disease (BD) is a multisystemic inflammatory disease, mainly characterized by recurrent oral and genital ulcers (GUs), skin lesions and uveitis. Several genetic factors such as the TNF-α gene have been evaluated as contributors to the pathogenesis of BD. We aimed to evaluate the association between six TNF-α SNPs and susceptibility to BD, or the major clinical manifestations, in Moroccan patients. The six SNPs studied were: c.-1211C>T (rs1799964), c.-1043C>A (rs1800630), c.-1037C>T (rs1799724), c.-556G>A (rs1800750), c.-488G>A (rs1800629) and c.-418G>A (rs361525), known as -1031T>C, -863C>A, -857C>T, -376G>A, 308G>A and -238G>A, respectively.
METHODS: SNPs were genotyped by direct sequencing in 120 unrelated Moroccan BD and 112 ethnically matched healthy controls. Allele and genotype distributions were compared between groups using chi-square or Fisher's exact tests.
RESULTS: The frequency of the -1211C allele was higher in (i) BD patients than in controls [P = 0.02, odds ratio (OR) = 1.68, 95% CI 1.10, 2.56] and in (ii) patients with GUs than in those without (P = 0.002, OR = 3.84, 95% CI 1.55, 9.49). The -418A frequency was lower in patients with uveitis (P = 0.0003, OR = 0.19, 95% CI 0.07, 0.5).
CONCLUSION: We report the first association between BD and TNF-α SNPs in Moroccan patients. We mainly observed that -1211C constitutes a susceptibility allele for both BD and GU, as previously reported for other populations. The -418A allele could be considered as a good prognostic factor for anterior uveitis, in Moroccan BD patients.",10,2012-Sep-1

Identification of Encephalitozoon cuniculi (E. cuniculi) as a possible causative agent for cataracts and uveitis in cats.
METHODS: Within a 12-month study period, cats that were presented with focal anterior cortical or mature cataract and secondary uveitis underwent a complete ophthalmic examination, complete blood count, serum biochemistry, serologic tests for E. cuniculi and tests for feline immunodeficiency virus (FIV), feline infectious peritonitis (FIP), feline leukemia virus (FeLV) and Toxoplasma gondii (T. gondii). PCR for DNA detection of E. cuniculi and T. gondii as well as cytologic examination of aqueous humor after paracentesis and phacoemulsified lens material were also performed. In addition histopathologic examination of the resected anterior lens capsule and attached lens epithelial cells was performed. Serologic testing for antibodies against E. cuniculi was also performed in 100 ophthalmologically healthy cats.
RESULTS: Eleven (19 eyes) European shorthair cats with a median age of 3.5 years were included. Nine of 11 cats had bilateral cataracts, with 12/19 eyes having focal anterior cortical cataracts and 7/19 eyes having mature cataracts. In 14/19 eyes anterior uveitis was present. All cats had a positive antibody titer (1:80-1:10,000) for E. cuniculi. Encephalitozoon cuniculi DNA was detected by PCR and sequencing in 18/19 lenses and in 10/19 aqueous samples. Five tentative positive results were detected by cytologic examination. Spores were detected in 15/19 samples of lens material with histopathologic staining. Only 2/100 ophthalmologically healthy cats showed a positive antibody titer for E. cuniculi.
CONCLUSION: Encephalitozoon cuniculi is a cause of focal anterior cortical cataract and anterior uveitis in cats.",10,2011-Sep-1

Posttranslational modification of proteins plays an important role in cellular functions and is a key event in signal transduction pathways leading to oxidative stress and DNA damage. In this study, we used matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization- time of flight (MALDI-TOF) to investigate the posttranslational modifications of the differentially expressed proteins in the retinal mitochondria during early experimental autoimmune uveitis (EAU).
METHODS: EAU was induced in 18 B10RIII mice with 25 µg of inter-photoreceptor retinoid-binding protein (IRBP) emulsified with complete Freund's adjuvant (CFA); 18 mice treated with CFA without IRBP served as controls. Retinas were removed from the experimental and control groups on day 7 post immunization; mitochondrial fractions were extracted and subjected to 2 dimentional-difference in gel electrophoresis (2D-DIGE); and the protein spots indicating differential expression were subjected to MALDI-TOF for protein identification and indication of any posttranslational modifications.
RESULTS: Of the 13 proteins found to be differentially expressed by 2D-DIGE (including upregulated aconitase, mitochondrial heat shock protein (mtHsp) 70, lamin-1, syntaxin-binding protein, αA crystallin, βB2 crystallin, along with downregulated guanine nucleotide-binding protein and ATP synthase) nine were found to undergo posttranslational modification. Oxidation was a common modification found to occur on aconitase, mtHsp 70, ATP synthase, lamin-1, βB2-crystallin, guanine nucleotide-binding protein, and manganese superoxide dismutase (MnSOD). In addition, aconitase hydratase, mtHsp 70, guanine nucleotide-binding protein, ATP synthase, syntaxin-binding protein, βB2-crystallin, and lamin-1 were also modified by carbamidomethylation. αA-crystallin had a pyro-glu modification.
CONCLUSIONS: Several proteins present in the retinal mitochondria are posttranslationally modified during early EAU, indicating the presence of oxidative stress and mitochondrial DNA damage. The most common modifications are oxidation and carbamidomethylation. A better understanding of the proteins susceptible to posttranslational modifications in the mitochondria at the early stage of the disease may serve to advance therapeutic interventions to attenuate disease progression.",10,2011-1-1

To quantify the rate of recurrence of acute anterior uveitis (AAU), and evaluate the influence of associated risk factors.
METHODS: We retrospectively reviewed the case notes of 185 patients with acute anterior uveitis, from their time of presentation to August 2001. The time to the first three recurrences of AAU from the onset of the disease was recorded, as well as the site of recurrence. Information regarding risk factors (for example (HLA-B27) status, spondyloarthropathy (SpA), family history of AAU/SpA and history of non-specific joint pain) were also collected.
RESULTS: Patients were followed up until their third relapse, or up to the censoring date (August 2001) if less than three relapses had occurred. The median length of follow-up was 35 months. One hundred and twenty-two patients (66%) developed at least one relapse and 67 (36%) had three or more relapses. Kaplan-Meier estimate of median interval between disease onset and the first relapse was 24 months 95% CI (16 to 34) and between the first and second relapse was 14 months 95% CI (9 to 22), and was 15 months 95% CI (10 to 25) months between the second and third relapse. Using Cox regression only the number of previous relapses was significantly associated with the risk of AAU recurrence. There was no significant association between other reported risk factors and the risk of relapse, and neither did any risk factor significantly modify the association between previous relapses and AAU recurrence (p>0.066 for all interactions). There was a borderline significant difference in survival according to the laterality pattern of recurrences (ipsilateral, alternate, or bilateral) with a slightly greater than expected number of events in those with bilateral recurrence (p = 0.048).
CONCLUSION: Patients with previous relapse(s) of AAU have a greater risk of AAU recurrence compared to those at disease onset but the risk of recurrence appears not to increase in a dose-response manner with increasing number of previous relapses. Demographic and extraocular features do not appear to influence the rate, or risk of recurrence of AAU.",10,2007-Mar-1

To examine the course of non-infectious uveitis during pregnancy.
METHODS: This is a retrospective case series. The medical records of 47 subjects with a previous history of non-infectious uveitis pre-dating their pregnancy were reviewed. Uveitis activity during the periods 1 year before pregnancy, during pregnancy and 1 year postpartum, were recorded. Information on patient demographics, type of uveitis, medication use, sex of child and breastfeeding status were also collected. The main outcome measures were the events of flare-ups during the prepregnancy, pregnancy and postpartum periods.
RESULTS: The rate of flare-up was 1.188 per person year prior to pregnancy, 0.540 per person year during pregnancy and 0.972 per person year in postpartum (p<0.001 for comparison between prepregnancy and pregnancy; p=0.009 for comparison between pregnancy and postpartum). Rates of flare-up only began to decrease in the second trimester. After delivery, rates of flare-up rebounded and within 6 months postpartum, flare-up rates were not significantly different from prepregnancy levels (p=0.306). Even so, 40% of subjects were found to have remained inactive within 1 year postpartum.
CONCLUSIONS: Uveitis activity decreased by mid-pregnancy, but returned to prepregnancy levels within 6 months postpartum. These findings may be used to adjust uveitis management during pregnancy and the postpartum period.",10,2013-Oct-1

The term spondyloarthritis (SpA) encompasses a group of chronic inflammatory disorders of the joints, including ankylosing spondylitis, psoriatic arthritis, reactive arthritis, inflammatory bowel disease, juvenile SpA and undifferentiated SpA. These diseases can also present with uveitis, or intraocular inflammation, which can be controlled with biologics.
RECENT FINDINGS: Profound success has occurred with the tumor necrosis factor-α inhibitors infliximab and adalimumab, moderate success with certolizumab pegol and golimumab and less encouraging results with etanercept. Promising results have also been demonstrated with interleukin-17 (IL-17) antagonists, such as secukinumab ixekizumab or combined IL-12 and 23 medications, such as ustekinumab.
SUMMARY: In cases of uveitis that require long-term control, biologics are an emerging and valuable class of medications for these patients, and may provide avenues to control both their underlying SpA and uveitis manifestations.",10,2019-Jul-1

To determine the long-term success rate after trabeculectomy without antimetabolites in patients with uveitis.
METHODS: Review of data from all patients with uveitis who underwent trabeculectomy for uncontrolled intraocular pressure secondary to intraocular inflammation between May 1990 and December 1994. Results were compared with those from a group of patients with primary open-angle glaucoma matched for sex and surgeon.
RESULTS: The uveitis group consisted of 32 eyes (20 patients). Maximum control of intraocular inflammation was achieved for a minimum of 2 months before surgery. Mean (+/-SD) age was 40.0 +/- 12.5 years (range, 14 to 67 years), with a median (+/-SE) follow-up of 53.0 +/- 1.8 months (range, 33 to 84 months). The primary open-angle glaucoma group consisted of 33 eyes (23 patients), with a mean age of 62.0 +/- 13.7 years (range, 26 to 81 years) and a median follow-up of 63.0 +/- 12.0 months (range, 34 to 299 months). The overall 5-year success rate (intraocular pressure < or =21 mm Hg with or without topical medication) for the uveitis group was 78% compared with 82% for the primary open-angle glaucoma group (P = .7). The absolute 5-year success rate (intraocular pressure < or =21 mm Hg with no medication) for the uveitis group was 53% compared with 67% for the primary open-angle glaucoma group (P = .87).
CONCLUSIONS: In the absence of other risk factors, such as Afro-Caribbean race and previous intraocular surgery, and with adequate preoperative control of inflammation, trabeculectomy without antimetabolites may be considered the primary surgical procedure for increased intraocular pressure in patients with uveitis.",10,1999-Oct-1

To examine whether measurement of serum angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) is useful in diagnosing sarcoidosis in undifferentiated uveitis.
DESIGN: Evaluation of a diagnostic test.
METHODS: Data collection was performed from 1035 consecutive subjects presenting with uveitis to Moorfields Eye Hospital undergoing measurement of serum ACE as part of baseline investigations for underlying systemic disease. The main outcome measures were sensitivity, specificity, positive predictive value (PPV), and negative predictive value (NPV) of elevated serum ACE.
RESULTS: Mean age of the sample was 41.7 years and 56.1% of subjects were female. Sarcoidosis was the underlying cause for the uveitis in 110 subjects (10.6%) and was more common in adults, female subjects, black subjects, and subjects with intermediate uveitis or panuveitis. ACE was elevated in 196 subjects (18.9%) and elevated levels were observed in 85 subjects eventually diagnosed with underlying sarcoidosis (true positive 77.3%) and in 111 subjects with an alternate diagnosis (false positive 12.0%). In adult subjects, sensitivity of serum ACE was 78.1%, specificity 90.0%, and PPV 43.6%, but the NPV was 97.0%. The test performed well, with area under curve (AUC) 0.897 (95% confidence interval [CI] 0.854-0.941). Serum ACE performed less well in distinguishing sarcoid uveitis in pediatric subjects, with sensitivity 60.0%, specificity 78.5%, and PPV 10.0%, but again NPV was high at 96.9% and AUC was 0.828 (95% CI 0.571-1.000).
CONCLUSIONS: Serum ACE had a very high negative predictive value for sarcoid uveitis, eliminating the need for further screening tests in subjects with normal serum ACE, unless clinical suspicion was high.",10,2018-Oct-1

Considerable differences were observed in the experimental autoimmune disease elicited by retinal S antigen, depending on the immunizing dose. An inoculum of 50 microgram produced a massive panophthalmitis containing many polymorphonuclear leukocytes, eosinophils, and mononuclear cells. A less severe endophthalmitis was seen in animals receiving 25 microgram of antigen. Animals receiving between 5 and 10 microgram of antigen developed a disease characterized by a granulomatous uveitis. The inflammatory infiltrate consisted primarily of mononuclear and epithelioid elements and appeared virtually identical to that seen in sympathetic ophthalmia. One microgram of S antigen produced primarily a nongranulomatous posterior uveitis composed chiefly of mononuclear cells. The principal change in the character of the disease occurred at dose levels between 10 and 25 microgram. This change consisted of the disappearance of polymorphonuclear leukocytes and eosinophils at the lower dose levels. These histopathologic changes suggest that at higher dose levels an immune complex disease may be superimposed on or replace a presumably cell-mediated hypersensitivity response.",10,1979-Oct-1

Recent reports show that gene therapy may provide a long-term, safe and effective intervention for human diseases. In this study, we investigated the effectiveness of adeno-associated virus 2 (AAV2) based human interferon-alpha (hIFN-α) gene therapy in experimental autoimmune uveoretinitis (EAU), a classic model for human uveitis.
METHODOLOGY/PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: An AAV2 vector harboring the hIFN-α gene (AAV2.hIFN-α) was subretinally injected into B10RIII mice at two doses (1.5×10(6) vg, 1.5×10(8) vg). AAV2 vector encoding green fluorescent protein (AAV2.GFP) was used as a control (5×10(8) vg). The expression of hIFN-α in homogenized eyes and serum was detected by ELISA three weeks after injection. The biodistribution of vector DNA in the injected eyes, contralateral eyes and distant organs was determined by PCR. EAU was induced by immunization with IRBP(161-180) three weeks following vector injections, and evaluated clinically and pathologically. IRBP-specific proliferation and IL-17 expression of lymphocytes from the spleen and lymph nodes were assayed to test the influence of the subretinal delivery of AAV2.hIFN-α on the systemic immune response. hIFN-α was effectively expressed in the eyes from three weeks to three months following subretinal injection of AAV2.hIFN-α vector. DNA of AAV2.GFP was observed only in the injected eyes, but not in the distant organs or contralateral eyes. Subretinal injection of both doses significantly attenuated EAU activity clinically and histologically. For the lower dose, there was no difference concerning lymphocyte proliferation and IL-17 production among the AAV2.hIFN-α, AAV2.GFP and PBS injected mice. However, the higher dose of AAV2.hIFN-α significantly suppressed lymphocyte proliferation and IL-17 production.
CONCLUSIONS/SIGNIFICANCE: Subretinal delivery of AAV2.hIFN-α lead to an effective expression within the eye for at least three months and significantly attenuated EAU activity. AAV2.hIFN-α was shown to inhibit the systemic IRBP-specific immune response.",10,2011-1-1

To determine the efficacy and safety of intravenous tocilizumab in refractory juvenile idiopathic arthritis associated uveitis.
PATIENTS AND METHODS: This was a retrospective observational case series. Patients with refractory juvenile idiopathic arthritis associated uveitis, who had received tocilizumab were included in this study.
RESULTS: 8 patients (14 eyes) were included in this study. The average age of the patients at the first visit was 16.8 ± 11.2 years (7-40). The average duration of follow-up period after starting treatment was 28.6 ± 24.6 months (9-70). Intravenous tocilizumab infusions induced and maintained remission in 5 patients (8 eyes). Vasculitis was resolved within 8 months in all but one patient. The presence of papillitis before starting treatment was directly correlated with visual acuity improvement. No side effects were observed.
CONCLUSION: Intravenous tocilizumab infusion can be an effective and safe method of treatment to induce and maintain remission in resistant juvenile idiopathic arthritis associated uveitis.",10,2021-Jan-02

Blau syndrome (BS) is a rare familial disease transmitted as an autosomal dominant trait, characterized by arthritis, uveitis, skin rash and granulomatous inflammation. Until now BS has been observed in 136 persons belonging to 28 families as well as in 4 sporadic cases. The gene responsible for BS has recently been identified in the nucleotide-binding domain (NBD) of caspase recruitment domain (CARD15/NOD2), also involved in the pathogenesis of Crohn's disease. In addition to three missense mutations (R334Q, R334W and L469F) previously identified, a new CARD 15 mutation (E383K) has recently been described in a family followed by us for the past 25 years. The characteristics of this family which, to our knowledge, is the only one affected with BS in Italy, are the object of this manuscript. Both the proband and her daughter were originally affected with a papulonodular skin eruption and then with mild arthritis of the hands and feet. The proband, but not the daughter, complained of severe chronic bilateral uveitis, followed by glaucoma and, a few years later, by cataracts. Histological examination of skin biopsies from both subjects and a joint biopsy (daughter only), showed non-caseating granulomas with multinucleated giant cells which, at electron microscopy, revealed ""comma-shaped bodies"" in epithelioid cells, thought to be a marker for BS. The disease is presently well controlled with low doses of prednisone for the mother and non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) plus low doses of prednisone, when necessary, for the daughter. As in Crohn's disease, CARD15/NOD2 mutation is believed to be responsible for the granulomatous autoinflammatory reactions probably triggered by microorganisms in BS.",10,2009-Jan-1

The review provides updates on novel risk markers for the development of pediatric inflammatory uveitis and a severe disease course, on treatment of refractory disease, and on the measurement of visual outcomes.
RECENT FINDINGS: There are several new genetic markers, biomarkers, and clinical factors that may influence a child's uveitis disease course. It is important to identify children at risk for poor visual outcomes and who are refractory to traditional therapy. Racial disparities have recently been reported. We describe agents of potential benefit. In addition, we discuss the importance of patient reported outcomes in this population.
SUMMARY: Uveitis can lead to vision-threatening complications. Timely and aggressive treatment of children identified to be at risk for a severe uveitis course may lead to improved outcomes.",10,2016-Sep-1

The study investigated the effects of the aldose reductase (AR) inhibitor benzofuroxane derivative 5(6)-(benzo[d]thiazol-2-ylmethoxy) benzofuroxane (herein referred to as BF-5m) on the biochemical and tissue alterations induced by endotoxic uveitis in rats. BF-5m has been administered directly into the vitreous, in order to assess the expression and levels of (i) inflammatory markers such as the ocular ubiquitin-proteasome system, NF-κB, TNF-α, and MCP-1; (ii) prooxidant and antioxidant markers such as nitrotyrosine, manganese superoxide dismutase (MnSOD), and glutathione peroxidase (GPX); (iii) apoptotic/antiapoptotic factors caspases and Bcl-xl; (iv) markers of endothelial progenitor cells (EPCs) recruitment such as CD34 and CD117. 5 μL of BF-5m (0.01; 0.05; and 0.1 μM) into the right eye decreased in a dose-dependent manner the LPS-induced inflammation of the eye, reporting a clinical score 1. It reduced the ocular levels of ubiquitin, 20S and 26S proteasome subunits, NF-κB subunits, TNF-α, MCP-1, and nitrotyrosine. BF-5m ameliorated LPS-induced decrease in levels of MnSOD and GPX. Antiapoptotic effects were seen from BF-5m by monitoring the expression of Bcl-xl, an antiapoptotic protein. Similarly, BF-5m increased recruitment of the EPCs within the eye, as evidenced by CD34 and CD117 antibodies.",10,2014-1-1

Ocular inflammatory disorders disproportionately affect women, and the majority of affected women are of childbearing age. The role of sex or reproductive hormones has been proposed in many other inflammatory or autoimmune disorders, and findings from non-ocular autoimmune diseases suggest a complex interaction between sex hormones, genetic factors and the immune system. However, despite the age and sex bias, factors that influence this disparity are complicated and unclear. This review aims to evaluate the gender disparities in prevalence, incidence and severity of the most common infectious and non-infectious ocular inflammatory disorders.",10,2015-Feb-1

Three hundred and fifteen patients with anterior uveitis associated with juvenile chronic arthritis (JCA) were studied in order to identify the various risk factors for uveitis. Girls were more susceptible to uveitis than boys by a ratio of 3:1. In 94% of cases the uveitis was diagnosed after the development of arthritis. The risk of uveitis was small after seven or more years had elapsed from the onset of arthritis. Patients with pauciarticular onset JCA had the highest risk of uveitis and systemic onset patients the least risk. The presence of circulating antinuclear antibody was also an important marker for an increased risk of uveitis. A regimen for routine screening of patients is suggested.",10,1989-Mar-1

We studied characteristics of ocular inflammation associated with Yersinia infection in 23 patients. After an acute onset with fever, diarrhea, and abdominal pain, 22 patients developed arthritis, 11 patients developed myalgia, 11 patients developed Reiter's syndrome, 17 patients developed acute anterior uveitis, and nine patients developed conjunctivitis. Sacroiliitis was found in 12 patients. The patients had high erythrocyte sedimentation rates, leukocytosis, and lack of antinuclear antibodies and rheumatoid factor. All 17 patients tested had HLA-B27 antigen. The patients with acute anterior uveitis showed aqueous flare, cells, fine keratic precipitates, and often exudates, posterior synechiae, vitritis, and macular edema. Acute anterior uveitis was mostly unilateral and resolved during corticosteroids on the average during the first six weeks; recurrences were seen in about half of the cases.

To compare the efficacy of adalimumab in eyes with active and inactive non-infectious uveitis in the real-world setting.
METHODS: Multicentre, retrospective, chart review of patients with refractory non-infectious uveitis treated with adalimumab. Main outcome measures included reduction of prednisolone dose, ability to taper immunosuppressives and a composite endpoint of treatment failure encompassing active inflammatory chorioretinal or retinal vascular lesions, intraocular inflammation grade and visual acuity.
RESULTS: Thirty-seven eyes of 22 patients were studied. Mean follow-up was 20.1 months (median: 13). Most had either posterior or panuveitis (n=12, 55%). Mean duration of uveitis at baseline was 83.2 months (median: 61), where the majority (n=15, 68%) had already been treated with two or more conventional immunosuppressive agents in addition to prednisolone. Oral prednisolone was reduced to ≤10 mg/day in 9 of 12 patients (75%) by 6 weeks. At 6 months of therapy, nine (90%) of the active eyes achieved a 2-step improvement in anterior chamber inflammation, with six (60%) demonstrating a similar improvement in vitreous haze grade. Almost all (n=17, 94%) of the initially inactive eyes maintained clinical quiescence at this time point. The incidence rate of treatment failure during follow-up was 88 per 100 eye-years for the active eyes and 24 per 100 eye-years for the initially inactive eyes. There were no serious adverse effects.
CONCLUSION: Adalimumab appears to reduce the corticosteroid burden in active and inactive non-infectious uveitis in the real-world setting. Inflammatory activity at the time of adalimumab commencement may determine long-term treatment success.",10,2018-Dec-1

Microglial cells are resident immune cells and play an important role in various cerebral and retinal inflammatory diseases. Notch1 signaling is involved in the microglia polarization and the control of cerebral inflammatory reactions. However, its role in endotoxin-induced uveitis (EIU) remains unknown. This study aimed to investigate the role of Notch1 signaling on retinal microglia polarization and inflammation in the cultured retinal microglial cells and EIU rat model. We found that Notch1 signaling blockade with N-[N-(3, 5-difluorophenacetyl)-1-alany1-S-phenyglycine t-butyl ester (DAPT) shifted retinal microglia phenotype from pro-inflammatory M1 phenotype (COX2",10,2019-1-1

Twenty-six patients (39 eyes) with retinal neovascularisation associated with ocular inflammation were identified from the retinal vasculitis clinic at St Thomas's Hospital. Eight patients had sarcoidosis, seven patients Behçet's disease, and 11 had idiopathic retinal vasculitis. Twenty-three patients had required systemic therapy to control the inflammation and 11 patients received laser photocoagulation. Fluorescein angiography showed significant capillary closure in 15 eyes and diffuse microvascular leakage in the remaining 24 eyes. All patients had posterior vitreous detachment. The visual prognosis was good despite vitreous haemorrhage being the presenting feature in 22 eyes, and the new vessels resolved in 70% of cases. However, laser treatment was followed by a significant increase in cystoid macular oedema (p less than 0.01). This retrospective study suggests that medical therapy is the first line of treatment in this group of patients. Photocoagulation should be performed when the eye is quiet and should be reserved for patients with recurrent vitreous haemorrhages and significant capillary closure.",10,1987-Nov-1

Immune checkpoint inhibitors can cause various adverse effects. Recently it has been shown that Vogt-Koyanagi-Harada (VKH) disease-like uveitis can occur in patients treated with nivolumab.
CASE PRESENTATION: A 69-year-old man developed bilateral panuveitis after nivolumab treatment for recurrent hypopharyngeal cancer. Slit lamp examination revealed bilateral granulomatous keratic precipitates, anterior chamber cells and partial synechiae. Fundus examination revealed bilateral optic disc edema and diffuse serous retinal detachment. His human leukocyte antigen (HLA) typing showed HLA-DRB1*04:05 allele. A lumbar puncture did not demonstrate pleocytosis. Bilateral sub-tenon injections of triamcinolone acetonide were initiated. As his panuveitis did not regress completely, steroid pulse therapy was administered. That therapy led to the resolution of his serous retinal detachment and to rapid improvement in his vision. Following this, we treated him with 50 mg/day of prednisolone for 1 week and then reduced it by 5 mg every week. No bilateral uveitis relapse had occurred by his 3-month follow-up; however, he subsequently died because of his cancer.
CONCLUSION: To our knowledge, this is the first report of a patient with NVKH who underwent a lumbar puncture. Unlike VKH, our case did not show meningismus or pleocytosis. NVKH may, therefore, have a different etiology from VKH. In cases of NVKH with posterior uveitis, steroid pulse therapy may be considered as a treatment option, as it is in VKH.",10,2020-Jun-24

Uveitis-glaucoma-hyphaema (UGH) syndrome is commonly reported following intraocular lens (IOL) implantation in the anterior chamber or malpositioned posterior chamber IOLs. It is extremely rare to have this complication in an eye with intact posterior capsule and a well placed in-the-bag IOL. We report a case of a 48-year-old man who presented with blurred vision after an uneventful cataract surgery in the right eye, and who was treated for anterior uveitis. The anterior chamber inflammation persisted despite intense treatment with topical steroids for 2 months, and the intraocular pressure was high. The posterior chamber IOL was in the bag and well covered by a capsulorrhexis margin. Dilated gonioscopy revealed inferior capsular bag hyphaema secondary to the superior haptic displacement due to a tear in the equatorial bag. Our case highlights the importance of dilated gonioscopy and a rare possibility of UGH syndrome in an eye with a well-placed IOL.",10,2016-Jan-19

Few reports have described hyphema in association with anterior uveitis. Five cases of anterior chamber haemorrhage are reported in patients with five different anterior uveitic entities: Reiter's syndrome, juvenile chronic arthritis, ankylosing spondylitis, idiopathic anterior uveitis, and herpes simplex. Hyphema has been reported in association with idiopathic non-granulomatous anterior uveitis, but not with the other four entities. In three cases, iris rubeosis was present. In two cases the patients were taking non-steroidal anti-inflammatory agents. The hyphemas occurred at times of heightened inflammation and resolved spontaneously without complication in all but one case, a boy with idiopathic uveitis who required surgery to remove the blood. The clinical outcome of these cases provides evidence that conservative medical management is usually sufficient.",10,1993-Oct-1

Inflammation is a risk factor for scarring after trabeculectomy surgery. Mast cells are important mediators of inflammation and scarring in allergic eye disease. This exploratory project investigated the presence of mast cells in the conjunctiva of glaucoma patients having trabeculectomy surgery.
METHODS: Conjunctival biopsies from glaucoma patients belonging to specific groups: medically treated glaucoma (M, n=6), repeat glaucoma surgery (S, n=8), and uveitic glaucoma (U, n=7). The control group (C, n=8) was retinal detachment patients undergoing repair surgery for the first time. Immunohistochemistry techniques stained for the presence of the intracellular mast cell enzyme tryptase.
RESULTS: The median mast cell tryptase-positive counts for all glaucoma groups (M, S, and U) ranged from 0.102-0.113 cells/mm2 compared to 0.064 cells/mm2 for group C. This was statistically significant comparing group S to group C (P=0.0063), but not when comparing groups U or M to group C. The mast cell tryptase-positive counts did not significantly differ among the groups.
CONCLUSIONS: Mast cell numbers were significantly increased in glaucoma patients who have previously undergone surgery (group S). Mast cell activity may contribute to the scarring process and the increased risk of excessive conjunctival scarring after trabeculectomy surgery. Further investigation needs to be performed to evaluate this potential role.",10,2009-Sep-1

Experimental autoimmune uveitis (EAU), an animal model of human uveitis, is an organ-specific autoimmune disease mediated by various inflammatory cytokines. In particular, tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-alpha, interleukin (IL)-1beta and interferon (IFN)-gamma are known to play a role in its pathogenesis. S-nitrosothiol S-nitrosoglutathione (GSNO), a slow nitric oxide (NO) donor, was reported to have beneficial effects in inflammatory disease in ischemia-reperfusion injury. The efficacy of GSNO treatment on interphotoreceptor retinoid-binding protein (IRBP)-induced EAU was investigated, using functional, histologic, and immunologic readouts.
METHODS: Mice were immunized with a single injection of IRBP(161180) peptide to induce EAU, followed by a daily treatment with GSNO (1 mg/kg). Electroretinogram (ERG) analysis, histopathology, and immunologic responses to IRBP were analyzed. The effects of GSNO treatment on the antigen-specific T-cell recall responses and their cytokine production were determined.
RESULTS: A single immunization of IRBP(161180) peptide led to significant structural damage of the retina and concomitant elimination of ERGs. Daily oral GSNO treatment from days 1-14 following immunization was found to be effective against IRBP-induced EAU. Histopathologic and ERG analysis both demonstrated significant retinal protection in GSNO-treated mice. The GSNO treatment of EAU animals significantly attenuated the levels of TNF-alpha, IL-1beta, IFN-gamma, and IL-10 in retinas, as measured by quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction analysis. The splenocytes isolated from EAU- and GSNO-treated mice had lower antigen-specific T-cell proliferation in response to IRBP protein, and their cytokine production was inhibited.
CONCLUSIONS: The oral administration of GSNO significantly suppressed the levels of inflammatory mediators in the retinas of EAU mice. This suppression was associated with the maintenance of normal retinal histology and function. These results clearly demonstrated the therapeutic potential of GSNO in EAU, and provide new insights for the treatment of human uveitis.",10,2007-Jun-1

Experimental autoimmune uveoretinitis (EAU) and endotoxin-induced uveitis (EIU), models for human ocular immunopathological syndromes, result in ocular inflammation in susceptible, but not in resistant rat strains. Moreover rapid photoreceptor degeneration occurs in susceptible rats developing EAU. In order to see whether differences in local ocular immune regulation may account for changes in resistance or susceptibility, we have examined the in vitro production of the cytotoxic cytokine tumor necrosis factor (TNF) by two resident ocular cell types, retinal Müller glia (RMG) and retinal pigmented epithelium (RPE). These cells were isolated and cultured in vitro from Lewis (Lew) (highly susceptible), Lew x Brown-Norway (BN) F1 hybrid (susceptible), BN and Long-Evans (LE) (resistant or poorly susceptible) rats. Constitutive production of the cytokine TNF, or its liberation in response to either interferon-gamma (IFN-gamma) or lipopolysaccharide (LPS) alone, was very low in RMG and RPE cells, irrespective of the strain. It was strongly induced by combined treatment with IFN-gamma and LPS in Lew RMG and RPE cells (mean values of 140 and 150 pg/10(5) cells, respectively) and in Lew x BN F1 RMG and RPE cells (mean values of 125 and 190 pg/10(5) cells, respectively), much less so from BN RMG and RPE cells (30 and 20 pg/10(5) cells, respectively) and remained undetectable in LE RMG and RPE cells. Hence susceptibility to EAU and EIU in vivo is correlated with the extent of TNF production by these two cell types under in vitro conditions, which may play a key role in initiating or perpetuating local immune responses.",10,1994-Nov-1

Emergent and resurgent arthropod vector-borne diseases are major causes of systemic morbidity and death and expanding worldwide. Among them, viral and bacterial agents including West Nile virus, Dengue fever, Chikungunya, Rift Valley fever, and rickettsioses have been recently associated with an array of ocular manifestations. These include anterior uveitis, retinitis, chorioretinitis, retinal vasculitis and optic nerve involvement. Proper clinical diagnosis of any of these infectious diseases is based on epidemiological data, history, systemic symptoms and signs, and the pattern of ocular involvement. The diagnosis is usually confirmed by the detection of a specific antibody in serum. Ocular involvement associated with emergent infections usually has a self-limited course, but it can result in persistent visual impairment. There is currently no proven specific treatment for arboviral diseases, and therapy is mostly supportive. Vaccination for humans against these viruses is still in the research phase. Doxycycline is the treatment of choice for rickettsial diseases. Prevention, including public measures to reduce the number of mosquitoes and personal protection, remains the mainstay for arthropod vector disease control. Influenza A (H1N1) virus was responsible for a pandemic human influenza in 2009, and was recently associated with various posterior segment changes.",10,2013-1-1

This review offers a contemporary history of the renin-angiotensin (RAS) and kallikrein-kinin (KKS) systems with emphasis on how these complex systems affect the eye. It describes the types of communication (cross-talk) between the two systems and evaluates their potential role in the development of diabetic retinopathy, diabetic macular edema, age-related macular degeneration, glaucoma, and uveitis. In addition to detailing the important physiological actions of components of the RAS and KKS, possibilities are suggested for new therapeutic avenues in the treatment of common ocular diseases. Historical notes indicate the major events in this research area, marking four decades from the first publication on the discovery of renin and angiotensin converting enzyme in the eye to the present time.",10,2018-Jan-1

Treatment of secondary glaucoma in uveitis patients is challenging. Owing to the young age of these patients, sufficient lowering of the intraocular pressure (IOP) is essential to prevent progression of visual field loss. However, because of the chronic inflammatory stimulus, filtration surgery has an increased risk of failure, especially in patients who have previously undergone surgery. Therefore, minimally invasive glaucoma surgery is a valuable alternative.
METHODS: The clinical records of 24 consecutive patients with uveitic secondary glaucoma who underwent trabeculectomy ab interno with the Trabectome® at the Eye Center of the Albert-Ludwigs University of Freiburg between June 2009 and June 2014 (registered in the Freiburg trabectome database) were retrospectively analyzed. The general baseline information for each patient included age, gender, glaucoma type, ocular medication and current IOP. The postoperative IOP and number of antiglaucomatous medications were recorded at each visit. Statistical analyses were performed using the Kaplan-Meier estimator and Dunnett's t-test.
RESULTS: The mean IOP before surgery was 31 ± 6.7 mmHg (median 32 mmHg). Both the IOP and the number of medications significantly decreased over the various follow-up intervals after trabeculectomy ab interno with the Trabectome®. Patients with follow-ups continuing past one year showed an IOP-reduction of approximately 40 % and a medication number reduction from 2 to 0.67. The failure rate (necessitating further glaucoma surgery) was N = 3 (12.5 %) patients.
CONCLUSIONS: Trabeculectomy ab interno with the Trabectome® is a minimally invasive and effective method for controlling IOP in uveitic secondary glaucoma.",10,2015-Nov-1

To evaluate the recurrence of uveitis after discontinuation of infliximab once control of inflammation is achieved.
METHODS: A retrospective cohort study was conducted of patients seen at the Proctor Foundation between 1998 and 2010 who discontinued infliximab after achieving corticosteroid-sparing control by Standardization of Uveitis Nomenclature criteria. The main outcome was the proportion of patients who had a relapse of uveitis.
RESULTS: Eighteen patients attempted to discontinue infliximab after achieving control of inflammation, and 11 patients had a relapse. Median time to relapse was 603 days (95% CI: 85-1461 days). Patients with juvenile idiopathic arthritis (JIA)-associated uveitis (n = 4) relapsed faster (median time to relapse: 76 days, p = 0.002) compared with patients who did not have JIA-associated uveitis (median = 1169 days).
CONCLUSIONS: The majority of patients who achieved control of inflammation on infliximab had a recurrence after discontinuing therapy. Patients with JIA experienced recurrence faster compared to other patients.",10,2014-Apr-1

To identify clinical variables capable of predicting long-term treatment duration of TNF-α inhibition in patients with Behçet's disease (BD)-related uveitis. Demographic, clinical, and therapeutic data were retrospectively collected from BD patients treated with the tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-α blockers infliximab and adalimumab. Patients still continuing TNF-α inhibitors at 48-month follow-up visits were classified as long-term responders and were statistically compared to patients discontinuing treatment before the 48-month visit. Forty-five patients (75 eyes) were enrolled. Thirty-two patients continued anti-TNF-α treatment for more than 48 months; 13 patients discontinued the treatment after a mean time of 12.3 ± 10.44 months due to lack (61.5%) or loss (38.5%) of efficacy.

This retrospective study analyzed 350 patients with the diagnosis of spondyloarthropathies (SPA) (207 with ankylosing spondylitis (AS), 80 with undifferentiated spondyloarthropathies (USPA) and 63 with psoriatic arthritis (PsA)) attended at a tertiary referral hospital for a minimum period of 5 years. All the patients presented complete clinical (axial and peripheral involvement, heel enthesopathies, extra-articular manifestations) and radiologic (sacroiliac, lumbar, dorsal and cervical spine) evaluation. HLA-B27 and respective alleles were searched. These data were compared with the occurrence of uveitis during the follow-up of the SPA patients. Thirty AS patients (14.5%) presented 55 episodes of acute anterior uveitis; there was statistical association between uveitis and juvenile-onset AS (P = 0.0094) and achillean (P = 0.0003) and plantar (P = 0.0067) enthesopathies; one AS patient presented a single episode of posterior uveitis, associated to tuberculosis. Seven USPA patients (8.8%) presented 13 episodes of acute anterior uveitis; it was not observed statistical association with any variable; one patient presented a single episode of posterior uveitis, associated to toxoplasmosis. Five HLA-B27 positive PsA patients (8%) presented 13 episodes of acute anterior uveitis. All the 26 positive HLA-B27 SPA patients with anterior uveitis tested for the HLA-B27 alleles were HLA-B*2705. No patient presented ophthalmologic severe sequelae of the anterior uveitis. Concluding, anterior uveitis was associated to the juvenile onset of the disease and to the enthesophatic involvement of the lower limbs in AS patients. The HLA-B*2705 allele was predominant in the anterior uveitis patients, whilst posterior uveitis was rare and associated to infectious disease.",10,2006-Oct-1

To analyze the involvement of the corneal endothelium in uveitis to better understand the formation mechanisms and the keratic precipitate composition. In vivo confocal microscopy images were correlated with ex vivo immunostaining of corneal endothelium from rat eyes with endotoxin-induced uveitis (EIU).
METHODS: EIU was induced in Lewis rats by lipopolysaccharide (LPS) injection. Slit-lamp examination and in vivo confocal microscopy were performed 6, 24, 48, 72, and 96 h after the LPS injection. One group of rats was killed at 24 h and the other rats at 96 h. Immunohistochemistry on corneal endothelium using antibodies to intercellular adhesion molecule (ICAM-1), phalloidin, CD68 (anti-macrophage), MCA967 (anti-granulocyte), T cell receptor alpha/beta (TCR alpha/beta; anti-lymphocyte), zonula occludens-1 (ZO-1), and occludin was performed on flat-mount corneas and was analyzed using a three dimensional (3D) laser confocal microscope.
RESULTS: In vivo confocal microscopy showed numerous hyperreflective round dots on the corneal endothelium, in the anterior chamber, and in the anterior stroma corresponding to inflammatory cells with a maximum at 24 h after the injection and detectable until the 96th hour. Upon immunostaining, corneal endothelial cells in rats with EIU overexpressed ICAM-1. ZO-1 and occludin had a lower endothelial expression and more heterogeneous distribution in EIU rats than in controls, showing disruption of endothelial cell junctions. Compared to controls, CD68, MCA967, and TCR alpha/beta expression was observed in corneas in rats with EIU. The two techniques showed a circular peripheral network of corneal vessels derived from a large circumferential vascular structure resembling the major arterial circle of iris where the inflammatory cells marginalized to infiltrate the anterior stroma.
CONCLUSIONS: The correlation between in vivo confocal microscopy and ex vivo immunostaining helped to better understand in vivo confocal microscopy images. The two new techniques applied here were very effective and complementary in evaluating the corneal endothelium involvement in EIU. Based on these findings, in vivo confocal microscopy in clinical practice could be very helpful to better analyze keratic precipitates and corneal modifications in patients with uveitis.",10,2008-Jun-16

Typically juvenile idiopathic arthritis (JIA)-associated uveitis (further referred as 'JIA-uveitis') has its onset in childhood, but some patients suffer its, sometimes visual threatening, complications or ongoing disease activity in adulthood. The objective of this study was to analyze uveitis activity, complications and visual prognosis in adulthood.
METHODS: In this multicenter study, 67 adult patients (129 affected eyes) with JIA-uveitis were retrospectively studied for best corrected visual acuity, visual fields, uveitis activity, topical/systemic treatments, ocular complications, and ocular surgeries during their 18th, 22nd and 30th year of life. Because treatment strategies changed after the year 1990, outcomes were stratified for onset of uveitis before and after 1990.
RESULTS: Sixty-two of all 67 included patients (93%) had bilateral uveitis. During their 18th life year, 4/52 patients (8%) had complete remission, 28/52 (54%) had uveitis activity and 37/51 patients (73%) were on systemic immunomodulatory treatment. Bilateral visual impairment or legal blindness occurred in 2/51 patients (4%); unilateral visual impairment or legal blindness occurred in 17/51 patients (33%) aged 18 years. The visual prognosis appeared to be slightly better for patients with uveitis onset after the year 1990 (for uveitis onset before 1990 (n = 7) four patients (58%) and for uveitis onset after 1990 (n = 44) 13 patients (30%) were either visual impaired or blind). At least one ocular surgery was performed in 10/24 patients (42%) between their 18th and 22nd year of life.
CONCLUSIONS: Bilateral visual outcome in early adulthood in patients with JIA-uveitis appears to be fairly good, although one third of the patients developed one visually impaired or blind eye. However, a fair amount of the patients suffered from ongoing uveitis activity and needed ongoing treatment as well as surgical interventions. Awareness of these findings is important for ophthalmologists and rheumatologists treating patients with JIA-uveitis, as well as for the patients themselves.",10,2016-1-1

Interleukin (IL)-18 has been described as a proinflammatory cytokine in rheumatoid arthritis and bacterial infectious diseases. The present study was designed to determine the role of IL-18 in a model of ocular experimental autoimmune uveitis (EAU). The initial studies were conducted to detect the expression of IL-18 in normal mouse eye tissue, and the later studies investigated induction of EAU in mice with an IL-18(-/-) phenotype.
METHODS: IL-18 detection was performed by using 5-bromo-4-chloro-3-indoyl-ss--D-galactopyranoside (X-Gal) staining on frozen sections of eyes from mice (129/CD1, DBA1, and Balb/c), either of normal phenotype (+/+) or of deficiency (+/-, -/-) in the IL-18 gene which had been replaced by introduced genes including LacZ under the control of an IL-18 promotor. Severity of EAU was assessed in DBA1 and 129/CD1 wild-type (WT) or IL-18 knockout (KO) mice after immunization with the uveitogenic antigen: interphotoreceptor retinal binding protein (IRBP) peptide 161-180. Lymphocyte proliferation and cytokine production were also measured in WT and IL-18 KO DBA1 mice 15 days after immunization.
RESULTS: IL-18 is constitutively expressed in the epithelial cells in iris, ciliary body, and retina. EAU-resistant mice (129/CD1) with an IL-18(-/-) phenotype remained resistant after immunization with IRBP peptide (P161-180). However, EAU-susceptible mice (DBA1) exhibited disease with similar histologic characteristics, despite a generalized reduction of interferon (IFN)-gamma and tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-alpha on an IL-18(-/-) phenotype. DBA1 IL-18(-/-) also demonstrated reduced IL-10 production.
CONCLUSIONS: The IL-18 gene is not necessary for the initiation or pathogenesis of EAU induced by IRBP peptide 161-180. IL-18 is expressed in the epithelial cells in iris, ciliary body, and retina in the eyes, but its role in the eye remains undetermined.",10,2001-Jan-1

To measure the levels of matrix metalloproteinase (MMP)-2 and tissue inhibitors of metalloproteinases (TIMP)-2 and to study the expression pattern and molecular forms of MMP-2, 8, 9, 13, and 14 and TIMP-1 and 2 in aqueous humor samples in cases of uveitis-related secondary glaucoma (USG) with a history of up to 20 years by comparison with primary open-angle glaucoma (POAG) and cataracts.
METHODS: 33 aqueous humor samples were collected during intraocular surgery. MMP-2 and TIMP-2 levels were analyzed by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. Molecular forms and activation degrees of MMPs and TIMPs were analyzed by Western immunoblotting and zymography. The results were related to the clinical data.
RESULTS: Enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay measurements of both MMP-2 and TIMP-2 were statistically significantly increased in the USG samples relative to POAG and cataracts (P=0.002). In Western blotting all the MMPs showed increased expression and conversion to their active forms in USG, whereas in the POAG and cataract samples MMPs were found mainly in their latent forms. MMP-8, 9, 13, and 14 showed statistically significantly elevated expression in USG relative to POAG and cataracts on densitometric scanning of Western blots. On zymography, MMP-2 and 9 activation was significantly enhanced in USG compared with POAG and cataracts.
CONCLUSIONS: Increased expression of MMPs and their conversion to active forms is characteristics of the aqueous humor in USG, even with a very long history. This emphasizes the fact that increased MMP expression reflects inflammatory disease activity and is probably associated with the development of USG and its complications. Although intraocular pressure is elevated in both glaucoma types, MMP expression in POAG more closely resembles that in cataracts, and therefore the role of MMPs in USG differs very markedly from that in POAG.",10,2006-Jun-1

An epidemic of early fetal loss (EFL), late fetal loss (LFL), fibrinous pericarditis, and unilateral uveitis which occurred during the spring of 2001, are together now known as the mare reproductive loss syndrome (MRLS). A similar epidemic with less intensity was reported during the same period of time from southern Ohio, West Virginia, and Tennessee. The same syndrome with lesser intensity recurred in 2002. The estimated economic loss from the syndrome in 2001 and 2002 together was approximately $500 million. Both EFL and LFL were characterized by the absence of specific clinical signs in aborting mares. Nonhemolytic Streptococcus spp. and Actinobacillus spp. accounted for 65% of the organisms isolated from fetuses submitted for a postmortem during the MRLS period in 2001 and 2002. The pathologic findings in fetoplacental units of LFL included bronchopneumonia and funisitis, and there were no findings in EFL. Epidemiologic studies conducted in 2001 suggested an association between the presences of eastern tent caterpillars (ETC) in pastures with MRLS. Experimental studies in pregnant mares by exposure to ETC, or administration by stomach tube or with feed material, reproduced EFL and LFL. Similar experimental studies in mouse, rats, and goats with ETC were unsuccessful. Currently, 2 hypotheses are proposed for MRLS. One hypothesis proposes that an ETC-related toxin with secondary opportunistic bacterial invasion of the fetus leads to MRLS. The second hypothesis suggests that a breach of gastrointestinal mucosal integrity by hairs of ETC leads to a bacteremia and results in MRLS. In 2004, a similar equine abortion storm was reported from Australia and caterpillar exposure was identified as a risk factor for the abortion. In 2006, the syndrome was observed in Florida and New Jersey.",10,2008-Sep-1

Uveitis in the pediatric population is uncommon, accounting for 2 to 14% of all uveitis cases, yet resulting in significant ocular morbidity. A number of studies have focused on patterns and complications of uveitis in the pediatric age group (≤ 16 years). In this report, we studied children with uveitis syndromes focusing on demographics, anatomic distribution, etiologies, treatment, and complications. We additionally divided subjects into two age groups to look into any differential characteristics pertaining to the younger age group and the role of amblyopia as a cause of visual loss.
METHODS: Retrospective chart review of 80 eyes of 49 uveitis patients aged ≤16 years. Subjects were categorized by age of onset into visually immature (≤8 years) and visually mature group (> 8 years). Data compared between the two age groups included demographics, disease characteristics, visual outcomes and complications.
RESULTS: Idiopathic uveitis was the most common diagnosis (51%). Anterior uveitis complications (posterior synechiae and band keratopathy) were more common in the younger group (p = 0.002 and p = 0.03 respectively) while posterior uveitis manifestations (vitreous haze and vasculitis) were more common in the older age group (p = 0.04 and p < 0.001 respectively). Amblyopia was the most common cause of vision loss in the visually immature versus cataract in the visually mature.
CONCLUSION: Anterior uveitis and its complications were more common in visually immature group in our cohort. Amblyopia was identified as the main cause of visual loss in the younger population.",10,2019-Jun-27

Recent models of experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis (EAE) have indicated that antigens co-expressed in the retina and uvea might be of pathogenetic relevance in Multiple Sclerosis (MS). We investigated the clinical spectrum and magnetic resonance imaging of 11 MS patients with concomitant uveitis, and determined the frequency of clinically silent intraocular inflammation in a prospective series of 50 patients. Two of the 11 patients had panuveitis, seven had anterior, and the remaining two had intermediate uveitis. The onset of uveitis preceded that of neurological symptoms by a mean of 8.5 years (range 1-20). None of the 50 MS patients studied prospectively by using slit lamp examinations and dilated funduscopy showed any evidence of uveitis but six patients had signs of retinal inflammation (""periphlebitis retinae""). Cranial MRI did not reveal ""atypical"" lesional distribution in MS patients with uveitis or periphlebitis retinae. No correlation between the type of MS and uveitis, or between the degree of neurological disability and the type of uveitis was found.",10,2001-Jun-15

Several lines of evidence support the view that increased free radical generation and altered nitric oxide (NO) metabolism play a role in the pathogenesis of highly prevalent ocular diseases, such as glaucoma and uveitis. Data are discussed indicating that melatonin, being an efficient antioxidant that displays antinitridergic properties, has a promising role in the treatment of these ocular dysfunctions. Melatonin synthesis occurs in the eye of most species, and melatonin receptors are localized in different ocular structures. In view of the fact that melatonin lacks significant adverse collateral effects even at high doses, the application of melatonin could potentially protect ocular tissues by effectively scavenging free radicals and excessive amounts of NO generated in the glaucomatous or uveitic eye.",10,2010-Aug-1

We analyzed the local antibody production in vitreous humor samples collected during vitrectomy in patients with severe vision-threatening uveitis. In 24 patients, paired serum and undiluted vitreous humor samples were collected and tested for antibodies against Toxoplasma gondii, herpes simplex virus, varicella-zoster virus, cytomegalovirus, Epstein-Barr virus, and Toxocara canis. Total IgG and the Goldmann-Witmer coefficient were determined. The initial diagnosis of ocular toxoplasmosis could be confirmed in six of the seven patients. The seventh patient showed a local antibody production against herpes simplex virus. One of the three patients with chronic panuveitis at initial diagnosis showed a local antibody production against T. gondii. These last two findings resulted in a change in medical treatment. Analysis of local antibody production in vitreous humor samples is a valuable diagnostic tool.",10,1991-Aug-15

The search for biomarkers in juvenile idiopathic arthritis (JIA) is a promising and rapidly expanding field of investigation. The biomarkers identified so far may help to dissect the clinical heterogeneity of the illness, measure the level of disease activity, predict clinical remission, relapse, response to medications, course over time, complications, and forestall disease flares.
AREAS COVERED: We provide a summary of the most recent advances in the development and application of biomarkers in JIA. We performed a PubMed search for significant articles combining predetermined keywords related to biomarkers in non-systemic and systemic JIA, chronic uveitis, and macrophage activation syndrome (MAS). The biomarkers available or under study are presented and discussed separately for non-systemic and systemic subtypes and for the two main disease complications, uveitis and MAS.
EXPERT OPINION: The incorporation of valid and reliable biomarkers in standard clinical care may help to design better patient-tailored treatment regimens and to improve the therapeutic strategies based on the treat-to-target approach. The establishment of biomarkers that predict the risk of disease flare may lead to define the optimal modalities for treatment discontinuation after the achievement of clinical remission.",10,2021-Aug-1
